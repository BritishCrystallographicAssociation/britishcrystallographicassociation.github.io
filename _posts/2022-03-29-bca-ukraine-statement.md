The BCA Council issued the following statement on behalf of the British Crystallographic Association following the  

# Statement of Support for Ukraine

The British Crystallographic Association condemns the terrible attacks on Ukraine by Russian armed forces which have precipitated a rapid and enduring humanitarian crisis. We are deeply concerned about the lives and wellbeing of our fellow Ukrainian crystallographers, scientists and citizens, and the future of crystallographic science in the country.

In common with many scientific fields, crystallography has thrived and progressed through international co-operation and sharing of knowledge. We add this appeal for a rapid end to the hostilities to those of many scientific organisations, communities and scientists around the world, including many Russians who have spoken out against the war.

The BCA will endeavour to assist Ukrainian colleagues displaced by war by offering to share information for those seeking temporary positions in the UK.
