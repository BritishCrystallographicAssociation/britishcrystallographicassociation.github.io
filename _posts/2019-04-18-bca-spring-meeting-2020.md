As another exciting BCA Spring Meeting draws to a close, we look ahead to next year's
meeting. It's not too early to start thinking about sessions and workshops for 2020.

The 2020 Programme Chair is Dr Thomas ("Ed") Edwards (School of Molecular and Cellular
Biology, University of Leeds, t.a.edwards@leeds.ac.uk) and each of the BCA groups has 
appointed two representatives to oversee the planning process. 

Save the date: the meeting will be held April 6-9th, 2020 at the University of Leeds.
