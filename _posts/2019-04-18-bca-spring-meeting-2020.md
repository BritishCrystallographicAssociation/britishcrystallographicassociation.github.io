As another exciting BCA Spring Meeting draws to a close, we're starting to plan sessions 
and workshops for 2020.

The 2020 Programme Chair is Dr Thomas ("Ed") Edwards (School of Molecular and Cellular
Biology, University of Leeds, t.a.edwards@leeds.ac.uk) and each of the BCA groups has 
appointed two representatives to oversee the planning process. 

Save the date: the meeting will be held April 6-9th, 2020 at the University of Leeds.
