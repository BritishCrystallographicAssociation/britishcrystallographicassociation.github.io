Following a public call for suggestions, Rosalind Franklin was chosen as the name for a new UK-built Mars 
rover which will be sent to the planet in 2020. 

Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer, led work determining the molecular structure of viruses, and, 
most famously, obtained the X-ray diffraction images of strands of DNA which led to the discovery of their
double-stranded helical structure.
