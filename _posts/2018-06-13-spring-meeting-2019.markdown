The organizing committee look forward to welcoming you to the Spring Meeting 2019 at the Jubilee Campus of University of Nottingham from 15th – 18th April 2019.

The meeting will begin with the optional, but increasingly popular Young Crystallographers’ meeting on the afternoon of Monday 15th April and morning of Tuesday 16th March. The main meeting begins immediately afterwards on Tuesday 16th and closes at lunch time on Thursday 18th April. An exciting and varied programme is currently being assembled by our programme committee, chaired by Emma McCabe, and promises relevant and interesting talks in every session. This meeting is a great opportunity to catch up with the latest crystallographic science, and of course with your fellow crystallographers.

The meeting will include the BCA Prize Lecture and the Lonsdale Lecture as well as plenary speakers from each group of the Association. The traditional early-career prize session will be held on the afternoon of Wednesday 17th March. Throughout the rest of the program there will often be three sessions running in parallel in addition to a range of workshops. Please visit the meeting website for up-to-date information.

We very much look forward to seeing you in Nottingham in 2019.

Details of the meeting will be posted on the [BCA Spring Meeting website](http://www.bcaspringmeetings.org.uk/home)
