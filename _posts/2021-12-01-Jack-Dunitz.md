It is with sadness that we learned the news that Professor Jack Dunitz died on 12 September aged 98, following a short illness. 
Jack was a giant of modern crystallography and many of us keep his textbooks close at hand at all times. Much of his career was based 
at ETH-Zurich, but he had roots in the UK and a close association with the BCA, being both an Honorary Member and one of the Founder
Members of the Association.
