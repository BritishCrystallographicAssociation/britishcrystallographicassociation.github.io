The BCA/CCG (Chemical Crystallography Group of the British Crystallographic Association) will be holding the 17th 
Intensive Teaching School in X-Ray Structure Analysis at Trevelyan College, Durham University. 

The school is intended primarily for younger scientists with some experience of structure analysis who wish to 
improve their understanding of the underlying principles and practice. The work schedule is intensive, with lectures 
starting at 17:30 on Saturday 6th April 2019 and the last lecture scheduled to finish on Saturday 13th April 2019 at 
17:30, followed by the school dinner. Students will depart on Sunday the 14th April 2019. The school provides a good 
mixture of lectures and tutorials sessions. The atmosphere is friendly and the accommodation and food are excellent. 
Participants must have a very good understanding of spoken English since there is a lot of material to be covered in 
rather a short time.
