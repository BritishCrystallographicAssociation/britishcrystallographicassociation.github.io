BCA Spring Meeting 2020 Cancellation statement

The Officers and Council of the BCA have been closely monitoring the situation generated by the continuing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for some time.  It is with great regret that we have concluded that the 2020 Spring Meeting should now be cancelled.  Great uncertainty remains over the future spread and severity of the epidemic, but the signs are that it may become very serious by the dates scheduled for the meeting.  Other comparable meetings are also being cancelled, and a number of companies and universities have announced travel restrictions for their staff.  We wished to act prudently and promptly to inform existing registrants, and cease accepting new registrations.

We apologise for the cancellation, but these are exceptional times and it was not an easy decision.  Discussions are ongoing in Council on the way forward, and we will work to put in place arrangements for the refund of registration fees.

Simon Phillips
President
