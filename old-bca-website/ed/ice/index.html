<h1>Web Sites of Relevance to Ice, <br>its structure and uses</h1>
<p>
Ice occurs in many places, it can be beautiful but is also dangerous.
There are many links to related web sites here.  The beginning of this
page is for people who want to learn a little about ice and look at some
pictures. 
<p>
This page is still under construction. 19 Jan 2000<br>
<a href="#tech">More technical information</a> for research
workers is at the end.

<h2>Ice in Space</h2>
<ul>
  <li>on the moon<br>
The Lunar Prospector space craft contains an experiment which can detect
the hydrogen atoms in water.  While orbiting the moon earlier this year, it
found evidence that ice exists over both lunar polar-regions.  It is
estimated that there are several hundred billion kilograms of ice in total.

  <li>in comets<br>
The core of comets consists of a mixture of water ice, frozen carbon
dioxide, solid ammonia, organic material and rock.  Make your own coment
<a href="recip.html">with this recipe</a>. When comets pass near
the sun they heat up, and some of the CO2 sublimes, leading to the tails
that can sometimes be seen. Here are images of 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/">ice on comets</a>. <br>
 <br>
Research workers at RAL are working on the ROSETTA project which plans to
land on a comet and try to analyse it.

<li>on planets and their satellites<br>
Triton, Neptune's largest moon, possesses both ice and large active geysers
of water.  Look at 
<a href="http://www.transatlantech.com/TPS/gsp-stars-neptune.html">
http://www.transatlantech.com/TPS/gsp-stars-pluto.htm"</a> for images related 
to Neptune.<br>

Charon, the largest moon of Pluto, is also covered with ice.  No
one knows what structure the ice possesses in these cases.  Look at 
<a href="http://www.transatlantech.com/TPS/gsp-stars-pluto.html">
 for images related to Pluto.</a>

<h2>Ice on the Earth</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Ice is Fun<br>
Ice and snow are beautiful to observe, great to play in and fun for
mountaineers. Look at <a href="http://www.web.co.za/everest/profile.htm">
 http://www.web.co.za/everest/profile.htm</a><br>
    <li>Ice is beautiful<br>
There are some beautiful images of snow crystals at 
the  <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/"> Snow Crystals site</a> mentioned in the front of Science for 14 Jan 2000.
   <li>Ice used in transport<br>
In colder parts of the world, skiing, skating and sledging, were essential
for transport.
Nowadays they are also sport and leisure activities.
Look here for

   <li>Ice sculptures<br>
Ice sculpture is a popular but difficult art form, practised especially in
Japan and Canada.  Some people also try to colour ice, but this is
difficult as ice normally expels solvents, including salt, as it freezes.
In nature, coloured snow is caused when fungi get incorporated into it.
Look at <a href="http://www.iatech.com/tour/features/sculpt.htm">this site</a>
and <a href="http://www.comnet.ca/~alain/alain/alain.htm">this one</a>

  <li> Ice for building<br>
You all know that Eskimos  can make <em>igloos,</em> houses out of
blocks of snow. Did you know that every year in the far, far north, by a snow covered forest a winter palace is built?  One of the first was built for a 
Russian empress in 1740. Now in Sweden, 200 kilometres North of the Artic
Circle an ice hotel is built every year. Look at 
<a href="http://www.jukkas.se/">their web site</a> for details
of room rates and how to get there. Building with ice is rather different
from building with stone, you can find tips on the art of ice building in
the book 'Ice Palaces, by Fred Anderes and Ann Agranoff published in 1983 by
Abbeville Press

<li><a name="ic">&nbsp;</a>Ice and Climate
  <ul>
    <li>Snow<br>
Ice is found in many forms on earth.  Snow flakes are formed when the air
is cold and water vapour freezes around a small speck of ice or dust.  When
undamaged they normally have hexagonal shapes, reproducing the underlying
atomic symmetry.  <a href="http://www.muohio.edu/dragonfly/snow/">Look here</a>
to find out more about snow. 

Some pictures of snow flakes can be found at

http://metsun4.geophys.hokudau.ac.jp:20080/crystal/gallery.htm</a>
  <li>Glaciers<br>
Glaciers are fed each year by snow falling in high mountainous regions.
The glacier slowly moves down the valley, carrying this snow with it, a
movement made possible by deviations from perfect atomic order called
dislocations.  The glacier scours the valley as it moves and the dirt and
rock so loosened become incorporated into it.  If the weather is cold over
several seasons the glacier grows in length, if it is warm the glacier
melts more than is usual and gets shorter. Look at this <a href="
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~qtluong/gallery/slides-alps/alp-show2.html">picture gallery</a>
  <li><a href="../../cnews/1999/mar99/icy.html">Crystal Sound in the Antarctic</a>
 has many places named after people who
worked on the structure of ice.  
  <li>Finding the age of the ice<br>
Ice Cores are cylinders of ice drilled out of ice sheets or glaciers.  They
can be several thousand metres long in total, although they are cut section
by section.  Since snow falls each year, and contains trapped gases,
chemicals and dust, chemical analysis of the core yields information on
climate and man's effect on the environment.  
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wgnlinks.htm">Information </a> 
going back half a million years has been obtained. 
  <li><a name="ifl">Icebergs</a> float<br>
Icebergs float, by Archimedes' principle, because the density of ice is
less than that of water.  They are found in many of the colder regions of
the world, where they exist for some time both because of the cold
surroundings (in fact sea water can often be colder than the normal melting
point of the pure ice in icebergs) and because it takes a lot of heat
energy to break the hydrogen bonds in ice.
http://www.rdc.uscg.mil/iippages/home.html
  <li>Where do <a name="ib">&nbsp;</a>icebergs come from?<br>
Icebergs can be 'calved' from ice shelves if an ice shelf warms up and deep
ice cracking occurs.  Ice cracks are usual in summer in polar regions, but
the calving of the glacier from the Larsen ice shelf in 1995 was unusual,
and accompanied other forms of disintegration of the shelf.  It was due to
recent warming trends in the area.

  <li>Icebergs can be dangerous<br>

It was an iceberg which sank the Titanic on its maiden voyage.
You can find <a href="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/titanic.html">
links to many sites</a> by looking at the Smithsonian site.<br>


If you wonder why the Titanic was made of such flimsy materials try 
looking at the site with the 
<a href="http://nano.nist.gov/Titanic/Titanic.html">
properties of the metals </a> from which the
Titanic was constructed.
