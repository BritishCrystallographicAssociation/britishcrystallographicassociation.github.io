<H2>Survey of UK undergraduate crystallographic courses</H2>
<p>
An understanding of basic crystallography is essential to many disciplines,
such as condensed matter physics, chemistry, materials, geology etc. The BCA  
is trying to find out how much introductory crystallography is taught as
part of undergraduate science and engineering courses, whether the course is
taught by a specialist crystallographer and whether additional educational
materials are needed for the students or lecturers. <br><br>
