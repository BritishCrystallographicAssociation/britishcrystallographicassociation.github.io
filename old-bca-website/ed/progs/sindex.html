<h1> Acorn, Mac, PC Progs</h1>
This list is being updated, please let the Webmaster

<h2>LIST OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PROGRAMS FOR MICROCOMPUTERS</h2>

 This list was originally for PC clones, but since both Macs and
Acorn are becoming more popular I thought the scope of the list 
should be widened. There are two parts, crystallographic, and general
programs. Are the general programs useful? or shall I leave them out
in the next update of this list?  The BCA Web site also has links to 
more <a href="../../com.html">commercial suppliers </a>and 
<a href="../cnews/sw/sw.html">software reviews</a> published in 
'Crystallography News', and to the programs listed by <a href="dec98.html">
Lachlan Cranswick.</a> in the Dec 98 issue of 'Crystallography News'.

   Please help me to keep the list up to date for crystallographers by 
supplying news of new programs or comments on the ones listed.
They may be good word processing or graphics packages, or teaching programs,
for research, or just amusement. Anyone know of an Escher type drawing
program for PCs for example?   

Please send me the information suggested below, together with anything
extra which you think important, either by e-mail to<br>

 This list was compiled from the most recent information I have received. 
 Help me to improve it by sending further program details, and any
 opinions, good or bad, you have of these ones listed. The ? following
 the 'Opinion' indicates programs whose details came from advertisements.

                   CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC INTEREST

ALCHEMY II: molecular modelling for the Desktop IBM PC or compatible
Computer:IBM PC AT,XT, PS/2 minimum 512Kbyte memory, hard disk, EGA
         graphics board, IBM or Microsoft mouse and driver
         MAC version coming soon
Details: The Sales Office, Evans & Sutherland Computer Ltd, Suite F,
        Centennial Court, Easthampstead Road, Bracknell, Berks RG12 1NN
Cost to academics: 300 pounds (excluding VAT) 
Opinion:Recommended by Dr. B.J.Sutton, King's College, London
        'We use it extensively for teaching Biochemistry and Biophysics
         courses, and in my opinion it is considerably better than DTMM,
        It has at least all the functions of DTMM, but is much easier
        to use.

ATOMS:  atomic structure display software, includes molecules, polymers
        and crystals, and an optional library of silicate structures.
        Allows various polyhedral representations, includes symmetry 
        operations, optionally plots the unit cell position.
        Direct Postscript printer output and EPS files, later versions can 
        read files in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre Format
        and display magnetic structures too
Computer: IBM PC/XT/AT, PS/2 and clones, Mac
Details:<a href="http://www.shapesoftware.com">Shape Software</a>
Opinion: Recommended by Dr.D.Waters, Earth Sciences, Oxford who published
         a review in Terra Nova 1991. He was impressed by the flexible
         control over the image, both on-screen and hardcopy, and found it
         much easier to use than the mainframe/workstation program SHAKAL.
         Particularly useful for inorganic materials and minerals.

         Only opinion I have so far (5 Mar 98) is from a PC user who saw it on
         a friends Mac and thinks it is much the best package he's seen for
         this application, but it is still not sufficient to make him fork 
         out all the extra cash to buy a Mac.

DIFFRACT 1.3:

        diffractometer traces, steroegrams, 2-D, 3-D structure projections
Computer: Macintosh (Plus-FX)
Details: Microdev. Software, 3120 NW John Olson Ave, Hillsboro
             Oregon 97124 U.S.A
Cost to academics: US$ 499
Opinion: Very versatile. Works for all crystal systems. Diffraction part 
         works well; will also take account of double diffraction.
         If atomic coordinates (or GEPs) are entered, it takes account of 
         systematic absences of space group. Can calculate structure 
         factors, angles between planes and directions, d spacings etc.
         Stereographic projections plot plane normals, or zone directions,
         but cannot plot e.g. plane normals with a zone axis at the centre.
         Has a occasional problems with the 'print' command and the 2 and 3-D 
         structure projections.

Opinion: ?  Information from supplier
  'Oxford Molecular was founded in June 1989 as part of the University
  of Oxford, with the aim of commercialising academic software in
  the molecular sciences. Academics placing their code through the 
  company benefit directly from sales royalties and research grants.'
  Thus they hope to make software cheaply available to academics and at
  the same time share algorithms with industry for a beneficial effect
  on the whole computational chemistry software market.

NRCVAX: System of programs for the solution, refinement and presentation of
        single crystal X-ray structures.

       The system contains all the routines required in the solution of 
       a crystal structure.  A set of filters permit movement of data from 
       most diffractometers and to and from many other programs.
       Final tabular output is available as well as the ability to write 
       CIFs.  Interactive versions of ORTEP and PLUTO allow easy production 
       of diagrams with output in Tektronix, HP-GL and Postscript codes.

       The PC version of the system comes with executables and full sources.

Computer: PCs (80386/387 or higher with a minimum of 4 mbytes of RAM,
          an earlier version is available which will run on any PC),
          Most other computers including Unix and VAX which are equipped 
          with either Tektronix or X11 graphics.

                  GENERAL INTEREST PROGRAMS

 1. Control Of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) programs

CamHealth - a COSHH management system for employers, including a
            hazards database, records of work activities and employees
            monitoring and safety training.
            (Details from AutoScribe address above)
Opinion: ?
                                    
COSHH Companion- a training program explaining the COSHH
                         regulations (Details from Autoscribe)
Opinion: ? 

HAZDATA a database with classification of hazards, toxicity data, 
        safety precautions, occupational exposure limits, monitoring
        requirements etc. 
Computer: IBM PC clone with about 4 Mbytes disc storage
Details: National Chemical Emergency Centre (HAZDATA),B7.22,
             Harwell Laboratory, Oxon OX11 0RA    tel. (0235) 432919
Opinion: More chemicals in the database than that of SafeChem, but
         difficult to extract their reports from the standalone PC
         and edit in our local details. When I saw a demo some years
         ago it could not display formulae with subscripts, nor search
         on formula, and fuzzy searches on name had to start from the
         beginning of the name.
   Cost: about 800 pounds in 1989

SAFECHEM II - a chemical hazard information program adapted for UK
         legislation, including a database of the 1000 most commonly
         used chemicals, ability to add your own new materials,
         a report generator for fact sheets with first aid details,
         toxicity information, precautions for use etc., and a
         laboratory recording scheme for management of hazardous
         materials
Computer: IBM PC preferably with hard disc
Details: Sergeant Safety Supplies Ltd, P.O.Box 78, Kegworth, Derby
             tel (0509) 672656                                   DE7 2XT
Opinion: Easier to use, with better reporting features than HAZDATA
         but not enough chemicals in the database for our environment
         where users bring samples for analysis on ISIS our spallation
         neutron source.
    Cost: in 1989 3000 pounds, may be rented more cheaply
