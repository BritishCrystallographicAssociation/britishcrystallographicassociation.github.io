<strong>Introduction</strong>

<em>Figure 1. Polyhedral representations of the low-temperature trigonal phase
 (left) and high-temperature hexagonal phase (right) of quartz. The displacive
 phase transition between the two phases is accomplished by rotations of 
SiO<SUB>4</SUB> tetrahedra, as indicated by the arrows.</em>
<P>
The objective of the work that led to the development of the CRUSH code was
to understand the origin of displacive phase transitions in crystal
structures that can be described as frameworks or networks of connected
polyhedra. For example, the famous perovskite structure can be viewed as a
framework of corner-linked TiO<SUB>6</SUB> (or ZrO<SUB>6</SUB>) octahedra,
with other cations (Sr, Ba, Pb ...) sitting inside small cavities within the
framework. Some of the displacive phase transitions in the family of
perovskites involve rotations of the octahedra. Many examples are found in
aluminosilicates, where there are corner-linked SiO<SUB>4</SUB> and
AlO<SUB>4</SUB> tetrahedra in frameworks of varying topology, including
chains, layers and three-dimensional networks. Examples are aluminosilicate
minerals and zeolites. Many aluminosilicates with three-dimensional
frameworks of tetrahedra undergo displacive phase transitions which involve
distortions of the frameworks as a result of rotations and displacements of
tetrahedra [1]. The most famous example is quartz, figure 1.

<P>
The displacive phase transitions we have described will involve low
frequency phonons which, to first order, will require no distortions of the
structural polyhedra. We call these phonons "Rigid Unit Modes" (RUMs), since
they involve the polyhedra moving as if they are rigid units. RUMs may act
as the classic soft modes, as in the case of quartz. The question of whether
a network of linked polyhedra can distort without the constituent polyhedra
having to distort also is actually a rather subtle issue that cannot be
dealt with here [2], but it is sufficient to note that in general there are
not many such possible distortions, and our task is to try to identify all
potential distortions for a given crystal structure. This is not an easy
task, and is made harder by the realisation that RUMs can occur with wave
vectors that could not be guessed in advance. The purpose of the CRUSH code
is to automate the enumeration of all RUMs for any given crystal structure.

<P>
<strong>Method of operation</strong>
<P> The problem involved in computing the RUMs for a crystal structure can
be described as involving two types of constraints. The first type concerns
the constraints that keep the polyhedra rigid. The second type is the need
to maintain the linkages between polyhedra. The approach taken in the CRUSH
code is to treat the constraint on the rigidity as a strict constraint, but
to treat the linkage constraints as slack constraints. This has been
implemented by our "split atom method" [2], which is illustrated in Figure
2. The split-atom method then allows us to cast the dynamical problem in
terms of the formalism of harmonic molecular lattice dynamics. The solution
to the lattice dynamics equations will give a zero frequency to any phonon
mode that does not involve distortions of the polyhedra, and the frequency
of any phonon will give a measure of the extent of polyhedra distortion
involved. Clearly the RUMs can easily be identified as the zero-frequency
solutions. The CRUSH code also allows for a harmonic interaction between the
centres of linked tetrahedra [3]. This has the effect of separating out the
RUMs that do not involve the flexing of the angle subtended at the link
point, and may be useful in the investigation of soft modes.

<em>Figure 2. Representation of the split-atom method. The atom shared by
two polyhedra is replaced by a stiff spring with an equilibrium length of
zero. Any motions of the two polyhedra that requires them to distort is
represented by the stretching of the spring, and formally the force involved
in the extension of the spring is equivalent to the force required to
distort the polyhedra.</em>

<P>
The calculations can be performed at any selected wave vector. For many
cases there will be no RUMs for a general wave vector, and usually we would
perform the calculations for wave vectors lying on lines or planes of
special symmetry in reciprocal space (e.g. points on the Brillouin zone
boundary). However, this can be misleading. For some zeolites we have
investigated there can be several RUMs for any general wave vector [4].
Moreover, we have found that often there are sets of wave vectors that have
RUMs which form exotic curved surfaces in reciprocal space - this result was
completely unexpected, and is not yet understood.

<P>
The CRUSH code performs the basic lattice dynamics calculations, but we have
a number of additional programs to perform other useful functions:

<P>
IDEALISER	helps set up a CRUSH run by adjusting an experimental crystal
structure to form perfect or idealised polyhedra

<P>
ANALYSE	will help analyse the CRUSH output by separating RUM solutions of
different symmetry, and imposing <strong>k</strong> = 0 RUM distortions on
the crystal structure

<P>
LOCALRUM	will take a set of RUM solutions and impose them on a crystal
structure to give a localised deformation, which is possible in cases such
as zeolites where there may be one or more RUMs for each wave vector

<P>
The CRUSH suite of programs is described in more detail in [2,3]. The
programs are written in FORTRAN and it is intended that they should be able
to run on any platform. Some of the ancillary programs, but not the main
CRUSH program, use NAG routines, which could be replaced by similar
routines.


<P>
<strong>Range of applications</strong>
<P>
The range of applications of the RUM approach has turned out to be rather
wider than we initially imagined. The main hope had been to explain the
origin of phase transitions in framework structures, and we have indeed been
able to explain a number of phase transitions in silicate minerals [1]. For
example, the complex sequence of phase transitions in the silica polymorph
tridymite is now much better understood following a detailed RUM analysis
[5].

<P>
We have subsequently realised that the RUM model can be applied to a range
of problems that is wider than identifying potential soft modes. These
include understanding the nature of high-temperature phases (the issue of
dynamic disorder within the crystal structure), understanding the origin of
negative thermal expansion (as in ZrW<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>, a crystal
with a network of linked ZrO<SUB>6</SUB> and WO<SUB>4</SUB> polyhedra),
predicting localised distortions in zeolite structures, and identifying the
flexibility of network glasses.
