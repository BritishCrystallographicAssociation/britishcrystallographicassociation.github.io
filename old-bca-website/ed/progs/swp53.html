<P>
Is it possible to predict inorganic crystal structures from little or no
initial knowledge of the atomic co-ordinates? The minimum requirement for
such a task is the knowledge of the lattice parameters and chemical
composition which are available from the method of synthesis and the X-ray
powder diffraction pattern. We have developed a general and robust procedure
which predicts the crystal structure from this minimum data and random
initial crystallographic co-ordinates. This has been incorporated into the
General Utility Lattice Package, GULP [1,2], for ease of use. It should be
noted that GULP already had the capability of fitting interatomic
potentials, locally minimising the lattice energy (under the Born model of a
solid) by optimising the approximate crystallographic co-ordinates and cell
parameters and calculating various properties (elastic constants etc.) of
the optimised crystal.

<P>
Our technique consists of three stages based on that developed by Bush
<em>et al.</em> [3] who successfully predicted the previously unknown
structure of Li<SUB>3</SUB>RuO<SUB>4</SUB>. To allow a more efficient global
optimisation of the crystallographic co-ordinates two quality measures are
used: the first (known as the cost function) is based upon the Bond Valence
Model and Coulombic interaction energy, and the second is the crystal
lattice energy. The cost function is a robust measure of geometry violation
and is faster to evaluate than the lattice energy. However, when the
structure has reasonable bond lengths, the final crystallographic
co-ordinates are less accurate than those produced by minimising the lattice
energy. In stage 1 of our procedure we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to
produce plausible candidate structures by 'breeding' configurations such
that good quality structures 'evolve'. The GA needs to evaluate the quality
of many candidates; thus we use our cost function throughout this initial
stage. Then, in stage 2, the co-ordinates of the plausible approximate
models are locally optimised such that the lattice energy (a better measure
of quality) is minimised. Only at this stage, when the prediction is
complete, is it necessary to compare generated and observed diffraction
patterns in order to determine which candidate structure is correct. This
third stage could also be extended to include a refinement of the
co-ordinates of the best candidates to improve the fit between the observed
and predicted X-ray diffraction patterns.

<P>
Ultimately we have created a 'user friendly' version of the crystal
prediction method of Bush <em>et al.</em>  with many improvements and
changes which gives the user more control options. The parameters for the
Bond Valence Model [4,5] are already encoded within GULP and a collection of
published interatomic potential parameters that can be used in stage 2 can
be easily down-loaded from the web,
"<strong>http://www.ri.ac.uk/Potentials/</strong>". So far we have generated
a wide range of known binary and ternary oxides (including various
polymorphs of TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, -quartz, perovskites, spinel and pyrochlore
structures) using our enhanced version of GULP [6].

<strong>General Utility Lattice Program (GULP)</strong>
<HR>

<P>
This is a program for the simulation of solids, molecules and defects using
interatomic potential models. Originally designed for the modelling of ionic
materials and incorporating the shell model for ionic polarisation, GULP now
contains all the functionality required to treat more general systems such
as biological molecules and metals. A particular feature of the program is
the use of space group symmetry both to build structures and to accelerate
the calculation.

<P>
The following is a brief summary of program features : <BR>
<UL>
 <LI>Geometry optimisation
 <LI>Location of transition states with eigenvector following
 <LI>Property calculation including elastic, dielectric and piezoelectric 
constants
 <LI>Phonon calculations including density of states and dispersion curves
 <LI>Calculation of defect energies
 <LI>Free energy minimisation for thermal expansion calculations
 <LI>Derivation of potential parameters by empirical fitting or from QM 
energy surfaces
 <LI>Interface to Cerius2 modelling environment (available from MSI)
</UL>

<P>
<strong>System requirements</strong> : <BR><BR>The code is written in
Fortran77 with non-standard extensions and is supported for all standard
Unix/Linux platforms. An MPI version will also soon be available for
parallel execution of energy and force evaluations during optimisation and
molecular dynamics.

<BR><strong>Availability</strong> : <BR><BR>The program is available to
academics working in Universities at no charge for non-commercial research
by contacting the author by email: <em>j.gale@ic.ac.uk</em><BR>All other users
should contact Molecular Simulations Inc.
