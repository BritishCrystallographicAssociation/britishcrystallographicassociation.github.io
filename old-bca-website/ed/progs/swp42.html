<h2>Editorial - Special academic software section </h2>
<p> some published in March 1999 others in later issues</p>
<HR>
<P>
   There has been a magnificent response to my request in the last
newsletter for details of academic programs. There are 7 articles here,
others have promised to send me their articles for the next issue. I will be
happy to welcome further software articles from any academics who care to
submit one, commercial vendors can take out an ad in the paper newsletter.

<P>
I have listed some large sources of academic programs on the first few pages,
including programs from HENSA, CERN and Daresbury. Then we have articles on:
(the numbers in () are the page number in the paper copy of the newsletter)<BR>

<h2>Software Supported by large establishments</h2>
<P>
The Higher Education National Software Archive (<strong>HENSA)</strong> is
on the World Wide Web,the part for micro computers is at   
<a href="http://micros.hensa.ac.uk"><strong>http://micros.hensa.ac.uk</strong>
</a>with sections for PCs, Macs, Acorn, and even some for the old BBC-B
micro. You can find versions of the popular protein display package
<strong>RASMOL</strong> there as well as <strong>POVray,</strong> a public
domain ray tracing package, with the additional utility
<strong>POVChem</strong>, which can convert a protein in the Brookhaven data
base format into input for POVray so that you can produce elegant shaded
molecular structures to impress your grant giving authorities.

<P>
Another very useful package is <strong>PGPLOT</strong> a portable graphics 
package written in Fortran77 which runs on most main frames and micros. For 
details see the web site
<a href="http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/">
<strong>http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/</strong></a>
<P>
Other people are beginning to see the benefits of using a portable graphics package as part of your own program. <BR>
The ISIS supported analysis software, <strong>GENIE</strong>, now uses PGPLOT 
for its graphics. <BR>Details are at  
<a href="http://www.ISIS.rl.ac.uk/OpenGENIE/">
<strong>http://www.ISIS.rl.ac.uk/OpenGENIE/ </strong></a><BR>
 <br>
ORNL, the originators of <strong>ORTEP</strong>, the thermal ellipsoid drawing
 program, have added an interface to PGPLOT to simplify porting ORTEP across 
to new computers. <BR>Details are at <strong>

http://www.ornl.gov/ortep/ortep.html</a></strong><br>

<P>
D.S.Sivia has written a set of routines PGXTAL, for 3D plotting with PGPLOT, 
PGXTAL can plot both crystallographic structures and density maps.  <BR>

<H2>PAW - A utility from <br>
the Centre for European Nuclear Research(CERN)</h2>

<P align=left>
PAW is part of the CERN program library CERNLIB. It is an instrument to
assist physicists in the analysis and presentation of their data. It
provides interactive graphical presentation and statistical or mathematical
analysis, working on objects familiar to physicists like histograms, event
files, ntuples, vectors, etc.   Contact  <strong><em>
<a href="mailto:paw.support@cern.ch">Paw.Support@Cern.Ch</a> 
</em></strong><em> </em>for detailed information. PAW is available free to
physics departments of Institutes in CERN member states.  It may be
available to other departments, or commercial users can pay for an annual
licence.  There is a wealth of information about PAW on the World Wide Web.
Start at URL <strong>

<P>
You can find a tutorial giving instruction in all the basic functions and
several levels of documentation including a comprehensive reference manual.
PAW has a modular construction and contains many programs which can operate
together. Many parts of it are written by users who contribute their
software to the library. It is the only academic program I have found which
can display 3 dimensional functions, such as those in the book 'The
Mathematics of Structures' reviewed in the last issue on page 50. I think
those plots were made by an expensive package. I have attempted to emulate
them using PAW. Please send me news of any other academic package which can
make such plots.

Emulation of Page 71 Fig 9a and Page 72 Fig10  in 
'The Mathematics of Structures' <a href="../cnews/books/dec98.html#p50">
(Reviewed in the Dec98 issue)</a>.
These plots show on the left cubic
packing of atoms with a constant of 3 and on the right  with a constant of
4. Merely by changing the value of the constant you can begin to see the
shapes of the surfaces between the atoms.</em>
