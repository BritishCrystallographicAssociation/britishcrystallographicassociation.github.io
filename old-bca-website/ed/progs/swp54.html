A selection of computer programs covering various crystallographic aspects
may be downloaded from my website [1] . Programs are available for the DOS
platform (also running in the DOS mode of Windows95/98) and for the Java
platform. Except for one, all programs offer a mouse-controlled graphical
user interface. Java programs are available in two forms, namely as applets
which may be run directly in a webbrowser, such as Netscape and Microsoft
Internet Explorer or as stand-alone applications, which require a Java
interpreter in form of the JDK [2] by SunMicrosystems<SUP>&copy;</SUP>.
Below the programs are listed by category. Programs are listed more than
once if they cover several categories. The superscripts indicate the type of
program: DOS program <SUP>(D)</SUP>, Java applets <SUP>(j)</SUP> and Java
applications <SUP>(J)</SUP>. Most programs (except applets) allow the user
to save the generated graphics as PostScript files. My latest software
project is the Java structure viewer JSV, which also includes diffraction
pattern calculations, stereographic projections, a periodic table and a unit
cell visualizer.

<h2>XD - A Computer Program Package for Multipole Refinement <BR>
and Analysis of Charge Densities from Diffraction Data.</h2>
<HR>

<P>
Characteristic of recent advances in X-ray diffraction is the increase in
speed, resolution and accuracy which makes it possible to study
macromolecular structures on the one hand, and to gain information on small
molecules at the electronic level, on the other hand. In the latter context,
quantum mechanics provides a link between energy, structure, and chemical
behaviour of molecules through the wavefunction. Development of the
molecular orbital theory has led to modern computational techniques for
approximating molecular wavefunctions, but the standard <I>ab initio</I>
procedures rapidly become unmanageable with increasing size of the system
considered (Veillard 1991). Density functional theory promises an
approximate treatment of electron correlation effects with a relatively
modest computational cost, and is being applied to chemical problems
(Labonowski and Andzelm 1991; Ziegler 1991; Kohn, Becke and Parr 1996), but
there still exists an upper limit to the size of the system which can
bestudied by this method. Explicit in density functional theory is an
approach that can bypass the calculation of the wavefunction. The
corresponding Hohenberg-Kohn theorem (Hohenberg and Kohn 1964) shows that
the ground state energy is a unique functional of the  electron density. It
gives a theoretical basis for inter-relating chemical properties through an
observable property - the charge distribution.

<P>
Modern single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis is a technique for
experimental determination of the electron, hence charge density (CD)
distribution rho(r) in molecules and crystals (Jeffrey and Piniela 1991;
Coppens1992, 1997). An analytical representation of the continuous
electrondensity of the unit cell as a sum over pseudoatom densities centred
at nuclear sites is exemplified by the multipole model of Stewart (1973),
which explicitly accounts for the asphericity of the atomic electron density
in crystals, caused by chemical bonding and intermolecular interactions.
Fitting such a model to high-resolution X-ray diffraction data leads to an
CD distribution which is by definition correlated, being a representation of
the true density. This density may be interpreted subsequently using the
theory of Atoms in Molecules (AIM) (Bader 1990). Indeed, application of the
AIM theory to experimental X-ray crystallographic results both requires and
greatly enhances the value of the multipole model.

<P>
Various computer implementations of this scheme developed from the early
1970s onwards, first for least squares refinement of the multipole model
with diffraction data, later for derivation of direct-space properties of
the density distribution and its analysis by AIM methods. The principal
programs or packages in common use are MOLLY (Hansen and Coppens 1978), POP
(Epstein, Ruble and Craven 1982), VALRAY (Stewart 1976), and LSEXP
(Hirshfeld 1971, 1977). LSEXP differs somewhat from the others in using
cosine functions which can be expressed as combinations of the spherical
harmonic functions employed in Stewart's original multipole model (Stewart
1973). 

<P>
In 1993 the IUCr Commission on Charge, Spin and Momentum Densities adopted
as a project the writing of an integrated package, to be distributed,
supported, documented and maintained centrally, with the objective of
promoting a wide application of X-ray charge density methods to chemical
problems. The outcome is the package now known as XD.
