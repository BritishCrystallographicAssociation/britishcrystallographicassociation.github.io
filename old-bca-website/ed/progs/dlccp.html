<P>
The Collaborative Computational Projects (CCPs), assist universities in
developing, maintaining and distributing computer programs and promoting the
best computational methods. Each focuses on a specific area of research and
is funded by the UK's EPSRC, PPARC or BBSRC Research Councils. Many of them
receive scientific support from the Daresbury Computing Department. The list
below shows those projects which may be  relevant to some area of
crystallography.<BR>

They mostly have web pages describing their activities. <BR>
Start from  <strong><a href="http://www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Home/">
http://www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Home/</a> </strong>  and look for the 
particular CCP of interest.  Reports on some of these have been published in 
'Crystallography News'; there is an update to CCP4 below. 
Previously it was Sept 97. We had a description of CCP14  
in March 1996 with an update in June 97

<h2>The CCP4  Program Suite for Protein Crystallography</h2>
<HR>

<P>
The Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) is an initiative of the
UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.  A major part of
the remit of CCP4 is the development, maintenance and distribution of a
software suite for protein crystallography. Applications cover most aspects
of protein crystallography including data reduction, various scaling
programs, Patterson search and refinement, isomorphous and molecular
replacement, MAD phasing, phase improvement (density modification),
structure refinement and presentation of results. The suite is ported to
most UNIX systems, including LINUX, as well as VMS. Since the CCP4 project
was established in 1979, the suite has continued to grow, both in the number
of programs included and in the number of users.  At the latest count, the
Suite included 130 programs, and was used at around 400 sites worldwide.

<P>
Programs are contributed to the suite by practising crystallographers from
many groups and countries. Integration of diverse programs into a single
package is handled by central staff at Daresbury Laboratory, who also govern
the distribution of the suite to users. Active development of the suite is
also pursued in a number of UK protein crystallography groups. This
mechanism means that program authors have access to a large user base, while
users have easy access to state of the art software. Contributions to the
suite are always welcome, and interested program authors should contact the
Daresbury staff, see below. In addition, a central part of the suite is a
library of routines commonly used in crystallographic applications and these
may be useful in non-CCP4 programs 
(see <a href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/dev/templates/templates.html">
http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/dev/templates/templates.html</a>).

<P>
New releases of the suite are made once or twice a year, as the number of
additions and changes to the suite warrant. Version 3.4 was released in May
1998 and it is hoped to release Version 3.5 in the near future. The latter
will contain the following new programs:

<ul>
  <li> DYNDOM: Program to Determine Domains, Hinge Axes and Hinge Bending 
Residues in Proteins where Two Conformations are Available     (Steve Hayward).
  <li> MTZMADMOD: Jiffy for converting between F+/F- and F/D 
  <li> FINDNCS: Find out NCS operations from heavy atom sites  (Guoguang Lu).
  <li> WATNCS: Pick waters which follow NCSs and sort out to NCS asymmetric 
unit (Guoguang Lu).
  <li> TOP: An automatic structure comparison program and Web server 
 (Guoguang Lu).
</ul>
<P>
In addition, there are major new versions of the maximum likelihood
refinement program REFMAC, which now includes individual anisotropic atomic
refinement, and of the density modification package DM. The latter program
now produces log files which contain HTML links to targets within the log
file and to targets in the program documentation. This reflects a continuing
trend to make the purpose and output of programs as clear as possible.

<P>
Following soon after Version 3.5 of the main suite, will be the first public
release of the Graphical User Interface developed by Liz Potterton at York. 
The GUI will work as an additional layer on top of the traditional Suite. In
addition to providing a user-friendly environment for running the suite, the
GUI will include additional functionality for project management and the
analysis of results.


<P>
The suite is available free to non-profit institutions, subject to a
completed license form being returned to the CCP4 secretary. A charge is
made to commercial users who should contact the CCP4 secretary at
ccp4@dl.ac.uk to make arrangements. Please note that all charges for the
suite are used to fund CCP4 activities. Further details on obtaining the
Suite can be found on the CCP4 web site
