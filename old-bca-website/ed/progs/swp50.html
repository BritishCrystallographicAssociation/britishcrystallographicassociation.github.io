<h2>CRYSTALS-32</h2>
<hr>
<P>
CRYSTALS is a widely distributed package for single crystal structure
analysis, including routines for data reduction, Fourier refinement,
least-squares refinement (including absolute configuration, twinning,
disorder, non-crystallographic symmetry, eigenvalue filtering and
robust-resistant weighting), structure modelling and modification, analysis
of structure, analysis of residuals, preparation of text and cif tables,
structure visualisation and hardcopy colour graphics. Because all these
features are incorporated in a single package, the user can move easily from
calculations to visualisation to revised calculations, and as such it is a
powerful environment for dealing with both routine and non-routine
structures. 

<P>
	Now, after 3 years of work involving collaboration with programmers in
America, France, Scotland and Switzerland, we are approaching the Beta
release of the native WINDOWS 95/NT versions of CRYSTALS. 

<P>
	Every output statement in CRYSTALS has been reviewed and revised to meet
modern requirements. Removing some of the old text was a rather melancholy
exercise, since in their time the messages proudly announced new
crystallographic innovations. Many of the items on users 'wish-lists' have
at last been incorporated. The visualisation module (CAMERON) was upgraded
by Louis Ferrugia to run in a proper Window, and has now been back-ported
into CRYSTALS. 

<P>
	A massive re-organisation of the internal data base and extension of the
structure factor expressions by Ludger Schroeder now enables the program to
handle models composed of both conventional anisotropic atoms and diffuse
electron density distributed over non-atomic shapes. 

<P>
	A completely new graphical menu system has been developed by Richard
Cooper, Markus Neuburger and Ludwig Macko. This sits above the
crystallographic routines, and enables a script-writer to control the degree
of interaction between the program and its user. Scripts exist for many
routine operations, and to control an undergraduate demonstration of crystal
structure analysis and Patterson methods.

<P>
	Interfaces permit the input of reflections in Sheldrick HKLF, native CAD4
(MACH3) and Denzo/Scalepack formats. Bob Gould's program SXTOCRY converts a
basic SHELX.INS file to CRYSTALS format, and Bruce Foxman's CSDTOCRY
converts a CSd data file to CRYSTALS format. For direct methods, CRYSTALS
communicates easily with SHELXS and SIR92. The CRYSTALS cif is compatible
with CHECKCIF and Ton Specks PLATON, and the graphical output from CAMERON
is in Postscript or encapsulated Postscript.

<P>
	Lachlan Cranswick (at CCP14) has put a lot of effort into setting up a
CRYSTALS web page, which will shortly be available to guide users through
installation and initial use. Keep your eye on http://www/ccp14/co/uk/

<P>
	Because of the deep seated changes which have been made to the code,
CRYSTALS-32 is being released in phases. Phase one will consist of the
crystallographic code, the graphical editor and the command line script
system, and as such is more-or-less a replacement for the DOS version of
CRYSTALS. This release will only be available to experienced CRYSTALS users.

<h2>Oscail - Windows based software<br>
for single crystal and powder diffraction </h2>

<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<em>Patrick McArdle, National University of Ireland, Galway.</em>
<P>
This windows based system provides the following facilities:
<UL>
 <LI>Space Group Determination
 <LI>Structure Solution
 <LI>Structure Refinement 
 <LI>Structure Visualization and Editing
 <LI>Hardcopy in several formats including direct printing
 <LI>High quality rendered pictures
 <LI>Powder pattern simulation
 <LI>File format conversion
</UL>

<P>
All of the components of the system are controlled by <strong>Oscail
</strong> and Windows help is provided for all of the programs.  The
excellent text editor <strong>PFE</strong> is incorporated into the system.
Most operations are just mouse clicks.

<P>
A brief summary of some of the systems features -

<P>
<strong>Absen</strong> - The Space Group Determination program is useful
from an educational point of view as it lists the special reflections in a
way which makes clear the number of reflections on which each condition
depends.

<P>
<strong>Ortex</strong> - The visualisation and structure editing program can
display and rotate up to 2,500 thermal ellipsoids in mono or stereo.  The
stereo can be red-green 3D or conventional.  Hard copy output may be written
in a range of formats (including HPGL and EPS) but may also be printed
directly on the PC's printer.  Direct picture import is possible into all
versions of WORD.

<P>
This system provided the first Windows version of Raster 3D the Unix program
developed by Ethan Merritt.  Programs are also provided which can be used to
make rendered movies.

<P>
It is often wise to check if a single crystal structure is applicable to a
bulk sample. The powder software can convert a .HKL file to a pattern with
"powder profiles."  These patterns are often indistinguishable from
experimental ones.

<P>
This software uses SHELXS and SHELXL which are provided by Professor
Sheldrick. These programs should only be used by registered SHELX users.

<P>
A web tutorial which includes a worked example and ten data sets suitable
for use in advanced undergraduate practicals is also available. 

<P>
The software is provided free to academic users and can be downloaded from

<h2>WinGX for Single-Crystal Small Molecule Crystallography</h2>
<HR>

<P>
The processing of a small molecule single-crystal X-ray or neutron
structure, from the diffraction data through structure-solution and
refinement to preparation of publication material, is nowadays a well
established and usually reasonably automated procedure. There are several
excellent commercial software packages such as SHELXTL and TeXsan which
provide all the necessary programs to undertake this procedure, but these
packages are often quite expensive and usually tied to the sale of specific
diffractometer hardware. <BR>

<P>
	Throughout the last three decades a great deal of superb crystallographic
software which is in the public domain, or which is at least freely
available, has been written. Such programs include the structure-solution
packages SHELXS, DIRDIF and SIR and refinement programs such as SHELXL. In
general, programs written by different authors use different file syntax for
common information such as unit cell parameters, atomic coordinates etc. To
ensure that the whole structural determination procedure is as automated and
simple as possible, it is desirable to spend little time and effort in the
data transfer between different programs. The WinGX suite is a coherent
collection of programs running under MS-Windows, in which the best available
public domain software has been included. The transfer of information
between different programs is handled automatically, and only rarely will it
be necessary for the user to manually edit files for this purpose. Most
programs have graphical user interfaces for the selection of options. <BR>

<P>
	The WinGX suite includes industry standards such as SHELXS, DIRDIF, SIR92,
SHELXL93 and ORTEP. Several absorption correction methods are available
<em>e.g.</em> analytical, Gaussian grid, psi-scans, multi-scan, DIFABS.
Contoured electron-density Fourier maps may be drawn and examined in cases
of disorder. A number of programs for the geometrical analysis of results
are provided, including PLATON, PLUTON,  PARST and THMA11. A range of
graphics programs are available for structure visualisation, while
publication- and presentation-quality graphical hard-copy may also be
obtained using the ray-tracing programs POV-Ray and Raster3D.  Publication
output via the CIF format is fully supported and extensive checking of
CIF-syntax and IUCr data validation is possible. There also interfaces to
external graphics programs such as RasMol and SCHAKAL and newer programs
like SHELXL97 and SIR97. A large number of utility routines have been
written to automate transfer of data from other systems, edit model files, 
display data etc and there are also many user-modifiable interfaces to
favourite external programs. <BR>

<P>
	Literature references to all the programs mentioned above in the WinGX
package are given in the program documentation, which is provided as HTML
files for hypertext viewing and MS-Word/PostScript files for hard-copy.
