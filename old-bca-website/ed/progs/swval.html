     Inorganic structures can be checked and analysed using bond valences
which are the electrostatic fluxes linking cations to anions (Preiser,
Loesel, Brown, Kunz and Skowron, Acta Cryst. B in press).  Gauss' law states
that the sum of the bond valences around any atom is equal to the formal
ionic charge of that ion, and experimental studies have shown that it
correlates closely with bond length.  Thus bond lengths can be used to
determine bond valences and comparing the bond valence sum with the formal
charge on an atom is a useful way of confirming the correctness of a crystal
structure determination.  Individual bond valences give an idea of the
strength of individual bonds and hence their importance in crystal
chemistry, and the valence sums can be used to determine the oxidation state
of an atom or the relative proportions of different atoms on a particular
site.

<P>
     Two programs, <B>VALENCE and VALIST</B>, are available to assist in
this analysis.  VALENCE is a DOS program that calculates the bond valence
when the bond length is entered from the keyboard (Brown, (1996) <I>J. Appl.
Cryst.</I> 29, 479-480).  It will also calculate the bond length if the bond
valence is entered.  VALIST is Windows (9x and NT) based and automatically
calculates the bond valences for each of the bonds listed in an input file
which may be in the format of CIF, GSAS or Fullprof output, or the bond
length files produced by ICSD for WWW.  VALIST can also be used to determine
the relative occupation numbers of two atoms occupying the same site.

<P>
     Both programs contain the parameters needed for this calculation but
these parameters can be changed from within the program if necessary. 
VALENCE provides the means for determining these parameters from
experimental observation.  The parameters used by VALIST reside on an
external file which can be edited by the user.  

<P>
     Although bond valences are based on the ionic model, they can be used  
for salts, minerals and ceramic materials and are particularly useful in
analysing lattice induced bond strains such as those found in perovskites
(Brown (1992) Acta Cryst. B48, 553- 572).
