<B>CRYSFIRE - Automatic Powder Indexing for Non-Specialists.</B><br>
  Robin Shirley, School of Human Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey  GU2 5XH, UK.

<P>
Increasingly the principal barrier to the <I>ab initio</I> determination of
structures from powder data is the initial determination of the unknown unit
cell - indexing the powder pattern.  Without this, none of the observed
intensities can be assigned to their correct locations in reciprocal space,
so that further progress is impossible.

<P>
CRYSFIRE (the new name for CRYS2RUN release II) is a unified system of
programs and scripts running under MSDOS (or in a DOS box under Windows)
that attempts to make indexing more accessible for non-specialists, as well
as faster and more manageable for all users.  Data are used in the form of
peak positions rather than profiles - these can be typed or pasted in very
easily, and facilities are also provided to import peaks-files generated by
programs such as WinFit and XFIT.

<P>
The new name CRYSFIRE indicates that the user can employ CRYS to fire off
indexing runs in a sort of shotgun approach, in which different indexing
programs are deployed to make a combined assault on the dataset in question. 
The two principal new features are:

<OL>
 <LI>The ability to make targeted calls to different indexing programs
without changing the dataset name, because all file in the runs are kept
distinct by system naming of file extensions (so that .LZS is a short [S}
output file from LZON [LZ], etc.).  This applies particularly to the
intermediate files used by QDAT, etc., which would previously have
conflicted.

<LI>The cumulative indexing history for each dataset is now collected in
both a log file and a line-per-solution summary file, in which the solutions
are kept sorted according to probability (i.e. lines indexed and figure of
merit).  This was achieved by modifying the source code of the new programs
to generate these files, and providing post-processors for the classic trio
of ITO, TREOR and DICVOL, for which it was considered safer not to mess with
the executables distributed by the respective authors.

</OL>

<P>
Other enhancements include:

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The addition of a further three target indexing programs (or program 
variants) - TAUP, KOHL and FJZN, to bring the total available up to eight..

<LI>The provision of two new translator programs WF2CRYS and XF2CRYS to 
import data from the peaks files written by WinFit and XFIT respectively.

<LI>Considerably more expertise built into CRYS to enhance its role as
indexing wizard, such as a comprehensive set of defaults which can often
launch a multi-program indexing process without the need for user
intervention.  For those not taking the all-default route, CRYS now supports
more of the main steering parameters used by indexing programs, providing
advice and a default in each case.


<LI>A new MERGESUM script to merge the summary files for two different
dataset names, leaving the merged summary optionally in a third file.  V/V1
ratios are recalculated, based on the volume for the solution now at the top
of the sorted list.

</OL>

<P>
Like the original CRYS2RUN, CRYSFIRE is a script-based system for
non-specialists that runs under DOS and calls the major indexing programs
using CRYS as a front end, feeding data to the indexing programs via the
format-translator QDAT.  CRYS is now at v9.33e. While continuing to provide
data-grooming facilities such as self-calibration for detecting and
correcting 2theta-zero errors, CRYS has been extended in its role as
indexing wizard, and now provides extensive advice and assistance in
launching indexing programs, including an all-default route.

<P>
Different datasets present problems to different programs, and the chances
of success increase if a variety of programs using quite different methods
can be deployed.  The number of indexing programs supported in the new
release has thus been increased from 3 to 8.  The classic trio of ITO, TREOR
and DICVOL in the original CRYS2RUN are now augmented by new versions of the
other programs, to give the following list (typical run times are shown in
square brackets and refer to a 200MHz Pentium):

<P>
1)	Jan Visser's ITO v12 [a few seconds]
<P>
2)	Per-Eric Werner's TREOR90 [under a minute]
<P>
3)	Daniel Lou&euml;r's DICVOL91 [a few seconds down to orthorhombic, 
5-30 minutes for monoclinic, depending on cell volume]
<P>
4)	TAUP (based on Daniel Taupin's 1974 POWDER program for exhaustive 
searches in index space [a few seconds down do orthorhombic, hours or 
days to monoclinic]
<P>
5)	KOHL (based on Franz Kohlbeck's TMO program for rapid heuristic 
searches in index space [under a minute]
<P>
6)	FJZN6 (a powerful ITO variant that uses the Ishida &amp; Watanabe 
PM criterion for evaluating zones) [15 seconds]
<P>
7)	LZON (a new PC version of the Shirley, Lou&euml;r &amp; Visser 
combined-strategy program, which uses zone-finding, the dominant-zone 
heuristic and dichotomy)  [up to 15 minutes]
<P>
8)	LOSHFZRF (a manually-aimed version of LZON, requiring the user to 
specify a basis set)  [under a minute]

<P>
CRYSFIRE runs under DOS (or in a DOS box under Windows) on any PC-compatible
machine offering c.550K base memory for DOS programs, and enough environment
space (typically 1K-2K) for the environment variables used to communicate
between the different components of the CRYSFIRE system.

<P>
Real-mode under DOS might be dismissed as a primitive environment, but it is
computationally very efficient and well suited to these compact but
computationally intensive programs.  A protected mode Windows version of
LZON turned out to run 3 times slower than the otherwise-identical DOS
version running in a DOS box under Windows on the same machine.

<P>
Unfortunately no Unix or Linux versions are available, since the tricky and
antique FORTRAN used by some of the indexing programs is unacceptable to
modern Unix compilers.

<P>
CRYSFIRE and its supported indexing programs are distributed free for
non-profit use via the CCP14 website (www.ccp14.ac.uk), where Lachlan
Cranswick has provided several detailed tutorials demonstrating its use -
for example, see <a href="http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/tutorial/crys/index.html">
