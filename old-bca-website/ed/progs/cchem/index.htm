This software is a single user interactive package which teaches
the principles of the atomic packing of spheres and shows how this is
related to crystal structure. </p>
<p>
It was originally marketed by the Institute of Materials, but they have now
returned the copyright to the authors who make it available here for
academic use. It must be copied complete and may not be sold or otherwise
used for profit. </p>
<p>
It was written in 1985 for the Acorn BBC Model B microcomputer,
and has been adapted since for various other systems, including RISCOS
systems and PC (DOS only). </p>
<p>Look in the <a href="manual.htm"> Manual </a> for
further details to find out which of the 3 available versions you want:

<ul>
  <li>for <a href="bbc.zip">BBC Model B or Master<a> (70K)
  <li>for <a href="riscos.zip">RISCOS micros</a> (75K)
  <li>for <a href="pcdos.zip">PC (DOS)</a> (110K)
</ul>

If there is sufficient demand, a version for the RISCOS Desktop can be
produced, please contact <em>Fortran Friends</em> by email: <a
href="mailto:fortran@argonet.co.uk">fortran@argonet.co.uk</A> with your
comments or for further information. Please let us know of any other similar
educational scientific software,  so that we can add a link from this page.
