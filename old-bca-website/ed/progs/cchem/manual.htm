<p>
There are now 3 versions of this collection of the four related programs; this
manual was originally distributed with the version for the BBC Model B (and
Master) microcomputer; it has since been adapted for all 3 versions. 
 
</p>
The sections of this manual are:

<h3>Running Instructions- getting started BBC-B or !65Host </h3>
<p>
The software will be more effective if used with a colour monitor, although
all programs can be run using a monochrome display with suitable contrast
and brightness settings. The package is compatible with the Watford 32K extension RAM or a TORCH pack
or any second processors.</p>

<p> This set of programs was originally  supplied on a 5.25in 40- or
80-track DFS floppy disc for the BBC Model B microcomputer.  Single sided
(40 track) discs have 3 of the programs on one disc,  with the fourth one on
another.  The images of these two 'discs' are in the directories 'side0' and
'side2' in this archive.</p>
 
<p>
Choose the way you want to run this program by clicking on your choice 
in the list below:
<ul>
  <li>either on a real <a href="#bbcb">BBC-B micro or Master 128</a>
  <li>or on a <a href="#bbcem">RISCOS micro using the emulator program,</a>
 !65Host.
</ul>
<a name="bbcb"><hr></a>
<h3> Using a BBC Model B or Master </h3>
<p>
Somehow you have to get these directories 'side0' and
'side2' from the archive onto DFS floppy discs in order to run them on
a BBC-B or Master computer. They were read using an external 5.25" disc drive
on an A540, a Beebug disc interface and !DFS.<br>
<p>
<strong>To Start</strong><br>
 Insert the disc in drive 0.<br>
Press SHIFT and touch the BREAK key to start. Or set the computer into
the Directory 'side0' and type CHAIN "MENU" 
 </p>

<p>
The disc should not be removed from the disc drive; because of the
amount of material presented, the programs are written in sections,
and pause from time to time to read more data from the disc. When
this is happening, a message to êWaitë appears on the screen and the
disc drive is activated and makes a whirring noise: do not worry, this
is quite normal. <a href="#gen">Click here</a> to skip to the section on
general running instructions.

<h3> Using RISCOS and the BBC emulator !65Host </h3>
These programs run outside the desktop, mostly in graphics MODE 1 with an
introduction in MODE 7. They cannot be run from a task window.
<br>
 <strong>You will need a monitor capable of displaying these modes.</strong>
<br><br>
Download the BBC/zip and unpack it using the !SparkFS utility, into
two directories 'side0' and 'side2'.<br>
Double click on !65Host to start the emulator running.<br>
Enter *dir commands to make 'side0' the current directory.<br>
Type   Chain "MENU" to start the package.
<a href="#gen">Click here</a> to skip to the section on
general running instructions.

<h3>Running Instructions- getting started RISCOS </h3>
<p>
These programs are simple adaptations of the ones written for the BBC-B with
just the machine dependent pieces changed to use standard BASIC
instructions. They are stored in a single directory. They run outside the
desktop, mostly in graphics MODE 1 with an introduction in MODE 7.

<br>
 <strong>You will need a monitor capable of displaying these modes.</strong>
<br><br>
Download the RISOCS/zip and unpack it using the !SparkFS utility.
Copy the !CrystalSt application to a suitable directory, either on a hard 
disk or on a floppy. Then double click on the !CrystalSt icon.

<a name="pinst">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Running Instructions- getting started PC DOS </h3>
<p>
This version runs on PCs <strong>using DOS only</strong>. It can be run from
systems using the 'Microsoft Windows operating System' but you will need to
make yourself a DOS window to start from. Sorry we cannot tell you how to do
this, there are so many slightly different versions of PCs.</p>

<p> You will need a CGA or EGA graphics adaptor. The program finds out for
itself which you have and uses the appropriate set of modules.</p>
<p>
Download the PCDOS.zip and unpack it using the unzip utility. Most of the
instructions are in this manual, but look at the README.TXT file for more
details.   Copy the directory CCHEM to a suitable directory, either on a hard 
disk or on a floppy.<br>
<p>
From your DOS prompt, (usually the character > ) type MENU followed by the
ENTER key (which may have an angled arrow on your computer keyboard).  In a
few seconds a menu appears on the screen, from which you can make your
selection of program using single key presses.</p>
<p>
Now follow the general operating instructions below, ignoring any statements
about using different discs; on the PC version all the programs run from the
same directory.  On some Windows systems, the screen may not return properly
to your normal operating screen at the end, but do not panic, usually you
can type 'quit' even if you cannot see the characters on the screen. This
usually closes the DOS window cleanly.
  </p>

<a name="gen"><hr></a>
<h3>General Running instructions</h3>

There are four programs in this set. They are written in BASIC, with some
assembly language to speed up the graphics in the earliest version; they
contain enough on-screen instructions to be used successfully by a computer
novice. Three programs describing simple crystal structures are on the first
side of the disc, while the fourth, which introduces interstitial packing,
is on the reverse side. Any of the programs can be stopped at the end of a
section by pressing the êQë key. </p>

<p>
To <strong>return to the menu</strong> at any time, press the êESCAPEë key.
</p>

<p>
To <strong>exit the programs</strong> at any time, press the êESCAPEë key to
return to the menu and press the 'Q' key.

</p>
<p>
In general, diagrams are shown on the left of the screen, explanatory
text on the right. The bottom line of the whole screen is used for
instructions, e.g. press SPACEBAR. When this line is blank, the
program is showing an animated sequence, and you must wait until
a further instruction is given. When an instruction uses the word
<em>êpressë</em>, only one keystroke is needed to continue the program; when
you are asked to <em>êtypeë</em> you may enter several characters, but the last
one must be the RETURN key to show that this is the last character.
The CURSOR keys, used in several places to rotate diagrams, are the
four keys with arrows.
</p>
<p>
The programs are intended for use by individual students, to help
them understand the basic concepts of atomic packing and crystal
structure, and to introduce them to some ideas of symmetry and unit
cells. They are designed to stand alone, but will be more effective
used in conjunction with models, and as part of a general course in
these topics.</p>

<p>Some students find it helpful to handle real models while working through
the programs.  Suitable models were initially supplied with the package.
These are no longer marketed, but you can make your own using, for example,
table tennis balls, cemented together with model glue from any toyshop.
You need three rafts of spheres as in the diagram:

<h2>HEXAGONAL AND CUBIC CLOSEST-PACKING</h2>

<p>
This program deals with the concept of simple structures as an array
of close-packed spheres. It compares the two common types of closest
packing (hexagonal and cubic) and introduces some simple concepts
of symmetry; an optional sequence explains about rotation axes. The
relationship between the cube and octahedron is explored. Self-testing exercises are provided.
</p>
<p>
The 3 rafts of spheres are particularly useful in this program to illustrate
the building up of the crystal in layers, and how the structure changes when
the layers are in different orientations. </p>

<p>
<a name="two">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>CUBIC CLOSEST-PACKING OF SPHERES AND
FACE-CENTRED CUBIC CELL</h2>
</p>
<p>
This program builds on what was learnt in the first. It introduces the
concept of the unit cell as the repeating unit of pattern, explains how
to reckon the unit cell contents and shows the relation between the
cubic close-packed array and the face-centred cubic cell. The
arrangement of interstitial sites is briefly explored and the
tetrahedron is introduced.
</p>

<a name="three">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>BODY-CENTRED CUBIC PACKING</h2>

<p>
This routine describes the other common type of packing, and
reinforces the concept of the unit cell introduced in the previous
programs. Coordination and packing density are discussed and
compared with those of closest-packed structures. Transformations
between the two types (important in metallurgy) are illustrated.
</p>
<p>
A suitable model was supplied using opaque and translucent spheres to show
the relation between unit cell and packing. These are no longer available.

</p>
<a name="four">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>INTERSTITIAL SITES IN CLOSEST-PACKED STRUCTURES</h2>

<p>
This program continues to explore the differences between HCP and
CCP, now with the emphasis on the arrangement of interstitial sites,
and the structures to be derived by filling them with a second type of
atom. The NaCl, NiAs, Li2O, BeO and ZnO structures are described,
and a number of self-testing revision examples are given. It uses the
same model as the first program, plus some smaller spheres to simulate 
additional interstitial êatomsë to assist in exploring derivative structures.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="photo">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHING THE SCREEN</h2>

<p>
Slides for projection can be made by photographing the screen. Use
transparency film of speed ISO 100 or 200. Mount the camera on a
tripod, use a cable release and have the surroundings as dark as
possible. For best results use a long focal length lens to minimise the
distortion due to the curved surface of the screen. An exposure time
of at least half a second is needed to overcome synchronisation
problems. We have found an aperture of f8 with exposure time of 1
second is about right for ISO 100 film.
</p>

<p>
The development and distribution of this type of software is still in
its early stages; comments, advice and criticism from users would be
of value and are actively sought by the authors.
