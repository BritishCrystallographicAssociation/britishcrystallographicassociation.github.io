We wondered if you could spread the word about Science Line amongst
your colleagues and students. We're always looking for extra areas of
expertise and knowing that we can contact other people when you're on
holiday or too busy would be very useful. If anyone is interested in
helping us out, they can fill in a form at:<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/intro/forms/expert.html">

<br>
or contact us at the office on 0181 735 5015.<br>
<br>
You may well remember receiving a letter thanking you for your help last
September when we took our 50,000th call. Well we've now doubled that! In
just 6 months Science Line dealt with 50,000 enquiries - the same number we
dealt with in the first 3 years existence. And we still answer between 60
and 70% of these immediately.<br>
<br>
If you haven't heard from us recently, we do apologise. We try to spread
the load, but we're not always successful. However we're about to introduce
new database software that should enable us to track more accurately when
we've contacted you. In addition, having your email address (if we didn't
have it before) should make it easier for us to contact you.<br>
<br>
And finally, the BBC, with whom we have close links, has let us know of a
service they offer that might be of interest to you. The BBC Alert service
lets users with particular interests know what BBC programmes are to be
broadcast each week in their chosen topic, either by a searchable website
or by free weekly e-mail: http://www.bbc.co.uk/alert.<br>
<br>
So you need never again miss out on TV or radio programmes on your
favourite topics. Alert is a quick and easy way to highlight things that
you want to hear about. Five topics are covered - Science & Technology,
Nature, Health, Countries & Cultures, Literature & the Arts. As well as
programmes, users will be provided with information on relevant events in
their region plus suggestions of books which suit the topic.<br>
<br>
If you have any comments about Science Line or would like any further
information, or would like one of us to come and talk about Science Line,
or you wish to make a donation to support our work,
please let me know.<br>
