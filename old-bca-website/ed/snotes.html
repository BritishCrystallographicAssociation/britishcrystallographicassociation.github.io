             NOTES OF A DISCUSSION MEETING HELD IN CARDIFF 
               during the BCA Annual meeting Easter 1995

 During the Poster Session at the Annual meeting in Cardiff a discussion
meeting was held amongst interested members.

  The main points emerging were:

 (i)In addition to programs to teach the fundamentals of crystallography
    to undergraduates, there is a need to teach graduate students the 
    pitfalls of using large complex data analysis packages. This might be
    done by simulating a session using an actual refinement program.
    These days few students are involved in the programming of such packages,
    and since they do not fully understand the inner workings, they can make
    absurd mistakes in trying to use them, and as a result deduce completely
    wrong crystal structures.
 
    We recognised that it would be difficult to find computing resources to
    run the refinement proogram itself, this might take too long during a
    student laboratory period, but a set of likely 'poor choices' could be
    simulated and the resulting errors explained. 
   
    Several academics promised to forward the 'scripts' of their exercises 
    to the authors who would try to suggest how they might be converted to 
    a packaged program for wider use.

  (ii)The IUCr published a set of cheap teaching booklets for students some
    years ago, but these are now a little 'dated' and we should approach the
    IUCr teaching commission to provide access to cheap software for student
    use, and provide an index to such software available over the World Wide
    Web.

  (iii)We should continue to maintain a list of teaching software, and any
    special projects such as the CTI, and TLTP refereed to above, and
    publish it periodically in 'Crystallography News'

  (iv)We should try to persuade HENSA,(the Higher Education Software Archive)
     to add 'Crystallography' as a topic to their subject index, give it
     pointers to suitable software already in their archive, and encourage
     authors of exisiting software to deposit their programs in HENSA, 
     to make them more widely available.

Following the meeting, there were demonstrations of public domain software
on PCs and macs; we will try to organise a similar 'Swap Shop' at next
year's annual meeting and possibly extend it to include ideas on teaching
materials and a corner where people with textbooks or journals they no
longer need can offer them cheaply to others.
