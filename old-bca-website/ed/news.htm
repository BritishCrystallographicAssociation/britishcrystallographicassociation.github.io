   <ul>
    <li>David Blow has written a new book, <br>
 <strong>Outline of Crystallography for Biologists</strong>
pub by OUP in April 2002, price £25 (paperback).<br>
 The publisher says the main text is non-mathematical
making it accessible to all biologists. The mathematics is contained in spearate boxes to offer deeper insight to those who want it.  I would be grateful for any opinions from those who have read the book.<br>
