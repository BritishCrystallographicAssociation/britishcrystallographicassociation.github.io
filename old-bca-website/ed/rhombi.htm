<h2>Make some close-packed Rhombic Dodecahedra</h2>
<p>To make this model you will need:
<ul>
 <li> A printer
 <li> Some method of cutting out paper or thin card
 <li> Quick-drying paper glue
 <li> An Acrobat PDF reader
 </ul>
</ul><hr>
<p><img align=left src="images/rhomb3.gif" alt="3-fold pack"><br><br>
 This picture shows a stack of rhombic dodecahedra. They close-pack, i.e.
they fit together with no gaps between them; here they are arranged to show
how they fit in threes:<br>1 at the top lying in a set of<br>3 which sit
in a set of<br>6.<p clear=all>
 <img align=left src="images/rhomb4.gif" alt="4-fold pack"><br><br>
 This picture shows the same rhombic dodecahedra but here they are arranged
to show how they fit in fours:<br>1 at the top lying in a set of<br>4 which
sit in a set of<br>9.<p clear=all>

 To make these models, download the  <a href="images/rhombi.pdf">PDF
</a>(20K); then follow the directions below to make the models.<br>
<ul>
 <li>First decide how many dodecahedra you want to make. The models above
need:<br>
1+3+6 = 10 for the 3-fold model;<br>
1+4+9 = 14 for the 4-fold model but you do not need to have them both built
up at the same time so 14 are enough.
 <li>Print  the page 1  of the PDF file so that you can see how to
construct the models.
 <li>Print the other 5 pages ( 2 - 6) onto stiff paper (we use
160 gm weight).  The dodecahedra are printed 4-at-a-time on page 2
 so you will need to print this 4 times on the same
coloured paper. If possible print the 4 sheets containing the bases,
pages 3-6 onto different coloured paper to show off the
models better.
 <li><strong>Do not scale the individual pages.</strong> They must all be
the same scale to fit together correctly. We have made the bases a little
bigger to allow for the thickness of the stiff paper.
 <li>You may find it more interesting to make the models in stages; 
for eaxample
first make 4 dodecahedra and then make a base to see how they fit in; next
make enough dodecahedra to finish this model etc.
 <li>Cut out all the nets with scissors or a modelling knife around the
outside solid lines.
 <li>Score along the internal solid and dashed lines with a compass point
and a ruler.
 <li>First make a dodecahedron; the one on the left of the cut-out sheet has
been numbered but the numbers should be inside the finished model and will
not show.
 Notice that the rhombus at the top (12) of each 'cut-out' does not have any
tabs; this should be the last one to glue.<br>
 Bend up the card along <strong>all</strong> lines.<br>
 Start at the bottom and glue the 3 rhombi (1, 2 & 3) together with the tab
'c' stuck to the top of face 1. In this way the outside will not show the
tab nor the ink of the lettering or lines.<br>
 Now continue up the chain of rhombi:
 <ul>
  <li>add faces 4 & 5 making a 3-fold vertex with tab d
  <li>add face 6 making a 4-fold vertex with tab g
  <li>add face 7 making a 3-fold vertex with tab h
  <li>add face 8 making a 4-fold vertex with tab f
<img src="images/rhomb9.gif" alt="before face 9" align=left>
<br><br><br><br>
Your model should look like this just before gluing face 9
to face 7 with tab i. The inside is coloured yellow and the tabs white.
 <br clear=all>
  <li>add face 9 making a 3-fold vertex with tab i
  <li>add face 10 making a 4-fold vertex with tab k
  <li>and a 3-fold vertex with tab b
  <li>add face 11 making a 4-fold vertex with tab m
  <li>and a 3-fold vertex with tab l
  <li>finally glue face 12 down onto tabs a, e & j making two more 3-fold
and two more 4-fold vertices
 </ul>

<br><br><br>
Here is your finished model. This figure shows a 3-fold and
a 4-fold symmetry axis. Which is which?
 <br clear=all>
 <li>the 3-fold base is the smaller one having only 9 dimples so make this
first, referring to the 'page1'  to see what it should look
like.<br>
 <img src="images/rhomb5.gif" alt="base 3" align=left>
 <br><br><br><br>There are 6 hollows with 3 faces each, 3 cross-over points
with 6 faces each and a peak in the middle with 3 faces.
 <br clear=all>
 After you have cut out and scored the model from page 3,
identify these features and glue up the triangular base making sure that:
  <ul> 
   <li>the dotted lines bend down (you're making the base upside down so as
not to show the guide lines);
   <li>the solid lines (mostly on tabs) bend up;
   <li>you stick the tabs onto the side with the guide lines so they don't show
on the top.
  </ul>
 Next glue on the surround for the base from page 4; each of
the 3 sides glues on to 6 tabs and finally glue the triangular base onto the
sides.
 <li>make the 4-fold base similarly from pieces on page 5.
 <img src="images/rhomb6.gif" alt="base 4" align=left>
<br><br><br><br>There are 9 hollows with 4 faces each, 10 cross-over points
with 4 faces and 4 peaks with 4 faces.
 <br clear=all>
  Glue on the surround for the base from  page 6; each of
the 4 sides glues on to 6 tabs and finally glue the square base onto the
sides.
