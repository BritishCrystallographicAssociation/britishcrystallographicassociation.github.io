<h1>Make your own models</h1> 
<p>
All you need to construct these models for yourself is a computer 
and a printer. There are several different kinds:
<ul>
  <li>Click here for an <A href="spfill.htm">introduction</a> to space filling shapes or here for a <a href="rhombi.htm">shape to make</a> for yourself,
 a model of a garnet crystal.
  <li>Click here for instructions for making 
<a href="crclas.htm">more models</a>; these are also space filling shapes,
include examples of all 7 of the crystal classes, and how to make the shapes
either closed or as boxes with an opening side.  
  <li>A Platonic mobile. 
Download <a href="mobile.htm">complete instructions</a> for making a 
mobile showing all the Platonic solids, from here as a PDF file.
  <li><A href="images/calcit.pdf">Calcite</a> makes an interesting Christmas tree 
decoration
   <li>Try finding the symmetry axes in this <a href="puzl1.pdf">
  puzzle page </a>( PDF format size 5K)
 with views of crystal forms. You may like to make yourself some paper
 models of these using the <a href="cubic.pdf">cutout-pages from here.</a>
 ( PDF format size 18K)

  <li> What else would you like? 
</ul>
Most of these models were made using the program !PolyNet which allows
you to create a planar net from a 3D solid.
