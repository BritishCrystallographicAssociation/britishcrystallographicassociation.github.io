              RESULTS OF THE BCA SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE

                K.D.Rogers, K.M.Crennell  April 1995

Many professional disciplines such as medicine, pharmacology and law have
well advanced, coherent schemes of computer aided teaching material and it
was proposed that the crystallographic community (through the BCA) should
initiate such a programme. To facilitate this (as most members of the BCA
will be aware),  about 6 months ago we initiated a survey of software
currently available for use in teaching crystallography. This was undertaken
to determine how widely such software is currently used and to identify
whether there is a need for further development. The survey form was
distributed to BCA members in the last two issues of 'Crystallography News',
and posted for us on the European Crystallography page of the World Wide
Web; in response we received news of other programs available over the
network. A list of educational programs is appended to this report, a more
complete version can be found on the BCA page of the World Wide Web, or sent
via email on request to BCA@isise.rl.ac.uk


We have received replies from almost 20 departments within the higher
education sector. Although this is not a large number of returns, we believe
that the responses provide a reasonably representative cross-section of
crystallographic teaching; departments of physics, chemistry, materials,
earth sciences, geology and biology were amongst those to provide us with
information. Disappointingly, no responses were received from any industrial
practitioners.

It is apparent that the majority of crystallography is taught at
undergraduate level (usually within years 1 & 2) or as part of an MSc.
Several centres indicated that crystallography was also included in
extramural & short courses but only 1 department included this subject
material within HND/HNC studies. Symmetry,  tessellations, and studies of 3D
solids are included in the National Curriculum for secondary schools, so
there may be software written for this market which we did not discover by
this survey.

Of the respondents currently utilising computers, all reported using
Apple/Macs or P.C.'s (70% P.C.) and only a few used ethernet systems. Of the
software used for teaching purposes, that published by the Institute of
Materials for atomic packing, stereograms etc was referred to most
frequently - although this was only used by 4 groups. Several departments
appeared not to use computer aided teaching methods at all and others had
'home-grown' software. A small number of respondents used software not
specifically designed for teaching such as DTMM and ATOMS (See list below
for supplier  information). Perhaps of some interest is the apparent narrow
range of software reported which has been specifically written for general
crystallographic teaching. There was little consistency in the recommended
course texts which probably reflects the wide range of disciplines who
responded. However, there were no texts used supported by accompanying
software.

The topic areas that respondents felt would be of value within teaching
software are given in the table below.

        ________________________________________________________________

We also received several suggestions
as to sources of information or software concerning teaching materials.

These included:

 (i) various journals (Chemistry in Britain, J. Chemical Education,
                       J. Appl. Cryst)
(ii) Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) centres (Physics, Biology,
                                                     Chemistry),
(iii) search engines on the World Wide Web ( WWW ) useful addresses are:
        http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/education/pps.html
        http://www.unige.ch/cryst/cryst-index.html,
(iv) NISS Bulletin Board (http://www.niss.ac.uk) 

(v) the world directory of powder diffraction software 
    (prepared by Syb Gorter and Deane K. Smith 
      e-mail ASKASG@rulmvs.leidenUniv.nl)

Of further interest are 2 substantial projects, in the Technology in
Learning Teaching Projects (TLTP), funded by the UK Higher Education 
Funding Council (HEFCE), which are currently developing software packages
for teaching a wide range of crystallographic subjects. Versions are planned
for both PC.s and Macs.

(i) The UK Earth Sciences Courseware Consortium, a TLTP administered from
the Department of Geology at the University of Manchester, is developing an
interactive crystallography module to cover unit cells, lattices, symmetry
and Miller indices (contact Dr Bill Sowerbutts - sowerbutts@mcc.ac.uk) 

(ii)  The Materials Teaching Educational Resources, a TLTP managed from the
Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Liverpool
(contact Professor Peter Goodhew - Goodhew@liv.ac.uk) is developing a
comprehensive package for both crystallography and diffraction.

The HEFCE expects these packages to be made available to UK academics for a
nominal sum to cover distribution costs only. It is not yet clear how this
software will be maintained beyond the end of the funding period.

Overall, despite the disappointingly low number of responses, the survey has
provided an indication of the current use of computer aided learning in
crystallographic teaching. We also have clear evidence that this type of
teaching medium is attractive and worthy of further development; all
respondents to the survey indicated their enthusiasm for this type of
teaching method and were keen to be kept informed of future progress.

Should the BCA do any more on this project? 

Here are some questions for you to think about:

1.Should the BCA develop a software series in basic crystallography? It is
not easy, and takes a lot of effort.

2. Should we approach the IUCr? They used to publish a series of teaching
booklets, perhaps the time has come for them to publish software.
 
3.Is there a need for software to teach basic crystallography which is not
aimed (as the 2 TLTPs are) at specific subject areas? 

4.What computer hardware should be used? Should it be persomal microcomputers? 
Might CD-ROM be useful?

5.Or could it be done using the Internet and the World Wide Web? Birkbeck are
just starting an experimental teaching progam for protein crystallography.

6. Should we just continue to collect information on educational programs and
publish the list?

7. Should the BCA seek funds for a research fellow and suitable software? The
fellow would bring the software to teaching laboratories for demonstration
for a few days, evaluate the software and write reviews for BCA members.
