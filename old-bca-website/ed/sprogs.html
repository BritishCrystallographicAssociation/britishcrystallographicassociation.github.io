<strong>ATOMS</strong> is a program for three-dimensional representation 
of all types of atomic
structures, including crystals, polymers and molecules.<p>
The standard display mode can show ball-and-stick, wire-frame, interpenetrating
atoms (space-filling) or coordination polyhedra, or combinations thereof.  The
new thermal ellipsoid mode makes drawings in the stype of ORTEP.  Drawing
features include shading, front-to-back fading, stereopairs and perspective.
Supports multiple structure fragments, isolation of molecules, full use of
symmetry, several boundary options, importation of files.  Windows and Mac
versions have completely graphical user interface; DOS version has interactive
keyboard user interface.<p>

**Windows V3.1.  ($395)  Requires 80386 or later processor, 4MB total memory.<br>
**Macintosh V3.1. ($395)  Includes 68K and PowerMac editions.  
Requires about 2.2MB available memory,  color Quickdraw.<br>
**DOS V2.3.  ($395)  Includes both 16- and 32-bit editions to run on almost 
any PC-compatible.  Thermal ellipsoids are only in the 32-bit edition.<br>
 <br>
**Libraries for ATOMS:<br>
	13 Basic Inorganic Structures ($40).<br>
	25 Silicate Structures ($60).<br>
	120+ Mineral Structures - includes all structures in two preceeding
libraries ($120).<br>

<strong>SHAPE</strong> is a program for drawing external morphology of 
crystals, and also sections
of crystals (Windows and DOS versions). It will draw any single crystal and most
twins and epitaxial intergrowths.  You enter the crystal axis lengths and
angles, the symbol for the crystal class, and one face of each form (symmetry
equivalent set).  The crystal can be rotated, scaled, twinned, etc.  A stereonet
can be displayed with the crystal, or stereopairs may be drawn automatically.
Screen display and hard copy of even complex, interpenetrating intergrowths may
be made in final finished form, with no extraneous lines.<p>

  <br>
**Windows V5.0, Professional Edition ($295) includes sections/growth-zones and
quasi-crystals. <br>
**Windows V5.0, Standard Edition ($195) lacks these things but is otherwise the
same. <br>
**DOS V4.2, Professional Edition ($295) includes sections/growth-zones and
quasi-crystals.<br>
**DOS V4.2, Standard Edition ($195) lacks these things but is otherwise the
same. <br>
**Macintosh V4.2 ($245).  Similar to Windows Standard Edition.  Includes 68K and
PowerMac editions.<br>
 <br>
**Library of over 700 crystals for SHAPE, based on crystal models designed by P.
Groth ($100).  Includes book with all drawings.<br>
