This note was sent in response to my request for information on teaching
materials for crystallography. The Author teaches in Spain. he writes:<br>
 <br>
I planned a set of wooden models which have been made by our carpeneter 
under my supervision. We have used them mainly for teaching in our 
Crystallography practical classes, at the Faculty of Geology in Oviedo.

The carpenter is able to offer for sale sets of such models, containing 
54 numbered wooden (beech) models (around 8 cm in mean size) in a wooden box,
with an explantory booklet. The 
<a href="modl33.gif">booklet describes each model by number,</a> 
crystal system, point group and crystal class of symmetry, 
Miller index of form(s),
stereogram and a drawing obtained with the 
<a href="http://www.shapesoftware.com">SHAPE program</a> of Eric Dowty.<br>

<p>
The models present symmetries of the 32 crystallographic point groups, some
point groups having more than one single model. 33 models represent mineral
habits, such as ortoclase, hornblende, struvite, gypsum, topaz, corundum,
cleavage rombohedron of calcite, pyrite, benitoite, pharmacosiderite,
apatite, and others. The majority of models are combined forms while some
difficult forms such as rhombic or tetragonal disphenoids are single
crystal forms.
<p>
The A4 sized booklet is available in Spanish, or English,

The price for one set is 40.000 pesetas VAT and transport
charges  not included. Orders should be directed to him.

<h2>Update 20 May 1999</h2>
The booklet has been translated into English.
The price for a set of models is still 40.000 pesetas (roughly 240.5 euros
which are almost the same exchange rate as US $) excluding postage and packing.
The package for one set weighs about 4 kilos. Surface mail shipping to the
USA is 5.500 pesetas (33 euros) or faster shipping 18.000 (108 euros)
 <br>
<br>
The models have been used in mineralogy courses by Abe Rosezweig and Credo 
Schwab in the USA; they say:<br
<em> "The models are very well done and if you are into serious crystal 
study, this is a must buy"</em><br>
they suggest you contact Joann Socash if you want further
 details. She speaks both Spanish and English, her email address is :
