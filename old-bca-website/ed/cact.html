<h1>Activities for Schools </h1>
<h2>associated with Crystal Growing Competitions</h2>
<h3>K.M.Crennell  August 1998</h3>
<P>
Crystals take some time to grow, so while they are growing you may like to try some of these activities:
<P>
1. <strong><em>Jewels Colouring Competition</em></strong><br>
<a href="../cnews/1998/sep98/colcom.html">Click here</a> to see a page of jewels,
print the page and then you are ready for the following activities:<br> 
<P>
   Colour in the 6 crystals, and then look in a book of minerals or 
jewellery to find out more about each jewel, for example:
<UL>
<LI>what is its chemical formula? what colour is it?
<LI>how hard is it? which one is the hardest?
<LI>which ones can be made in a laboratory? How is it done?
<LI>where is it found naturally? How is it extracted?
<LI>does it have any industrial uses? In addition to its use as jewellery.
<LI>have there been any particularly famous specimens? Who owned them? 
Where are they now?
<LI>the jewels are drawn as polyhedra, do any of them have special names?
<LI>what else can you find out about these jewels? Write and tell us.
</UL>
<P>
2. <strong><em>Make your own garnet</em></strong>
<P>
Cut out the plane shape of a 
 <a href="../cnews/1998/dec98/pag56.html">garnet</a> carefully, 
use glue or sticky tape to
fix the tabs on to the opposite faces to make your own three dimensional
model.   <BR>
Try stacking up several models to see whether they make a
completely solid block with no gaps between them.  Can you think of any
other shapes which can fill space in this way?

<P>
3. <strong><em>Crystals on postage stamps</em></strong>
<BR>Many people collect postage stamps, common themes are birds, animals, 
modes of transport, less common are minerals and crystals.  Make a list of
 stamps related to crystals, including the country of issue, date, topic, etc
.  Here are some to start with.<br>

<img  src="../cnews/phil/uk88.gif" alt="snowflake">
<img  src="../cnews/phil/us92.gif" alt="1992 copper" >
<BR>
Which country issued them?<BR>
When?<BR>
What crystals are they?<BR>
Why were they issued?
<P>
4. <strong><em>Make a list of Nobel prize winners associated with 
crystallography</em></strong>
<P>
What are Nobel prizes? Who awards them?  For what achievements? How often?
 Make a list of those who have won prizes for work associated with crystals.
 There is no prize for crystallography, but prizes associated with other
 subjects, chemistry, physics and medicine, have been given for work on the 
structure of crystals.
<P>
5. <strong><em>Surf the Internet to look for sites associated with crystals</em></strong>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Try searching for other sites on the World Wide Web associated with crystals.
  Sites may have images of natural crystals, or you can learn how crystals are
 essential to many modern industrial products. 
Find out how a quartz watch works, how liquid crystals are used in some 
computing screens, and many other exciting things.<BR>
<BR>
<br>
<em>Please send comments on these activities or news of anything you find out,
 particularly the details of any stamps issued or Internet site URLs you find
 to the British Crystallographic Association, prefrably by email to the
Webmaster at the address below.</em> <br>
