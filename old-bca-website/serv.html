<h1>Crystallographic Services</h1> 
This page lists addresses of <em>academics</em> who offer their services to 
determine crystal structures (or other crystallographic services)
to people who may not need to install their own in-house facility but who
have an occasional need for such a service. Commercial service providers
can be linked to the BCA <a href=com.html>'Commerce'</a> page.<p>

If you have a service to offer, or are looking for a service, please complete 
the Form below and return it to the BCAWebmaster at the address below. 
alternatively just send the address of the URL where information about the 
service can be found, and I will add a link to it from this page.
