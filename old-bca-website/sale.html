<h3>Free Diffractometer - from WBB Technology</h3>
<p>
WBB Technology have recently bought a new diffractometer to replace their
approximately 10 years old one which is still fully operational. It is a 
Philips PW1800 powder X-ray diffractometer which has a 20 position sample
changer. <br><br>  

It is available free-of-charge to any potential user who would pay all
transport costs in taking it from our laboratories in Newton Abbot.<br><br>

Powder Diffraction Equipment Sought for Donation
</p><p>
The Department of Chemistry, University of Nairobi, Kenya are trying to
develop competence, and eventually establish teaching and research
programmes in X-ray analysis.  Financial resources are very limited.  The
CCDC recently donated and commissioned a system for geometric data
collection from single crystals, comprising a sealed source generator and
cameras.  A powder diffractometer is also required.

<P>
Any suitable equipment in working order would be gratefully received as a 
donation towards this initiative.  Funding for transportation is likely to 
be available.  <BR>
For details please contact:<br>

Two items today<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Four-circle diffractometer for sale</strong><br>
We have a Siemens/Nicolet P3 four-circle X-ray diffractometer that we no longer
use and would be happy to sell. It has a 3 kW solid-state generator driving a
sealed X-ray tube, a MicroVAX host computer and an extended two-theta arm.
Although about 9 years old, it has not been extensively used but has
nevertheless been maintained under contract throughout. It is, consequently, in
excellent condition. It would be most suitable for a small-molecule
crystallography laboratory.
 <br>
<p>
We are prepared to consider any reasonable offer for the system.<br>

Dr Moreton Moore (Royal Holloway, University of London) would be pleased to
hear from anyone who would like to make offers for a Weissenberg camera,
powder diffractometers, powder cameras, an X-ray generator and other items.
In good condition. One careful owner. Further details on request.<br>

<Strong>CAD4 FOR SALE</strong><br> 
We wish to sell an Enraf Nonius CAD4 four-circle diffractometer which is
no longer capable of making a significant contribution to the increasing
workload of our Department.  However, the instrument is in working
condition and may be appropriate for a department or research group with a
modest requirement for data collection.  Some refurbishment would be
advisable and upgrading is a possibility.  It is currently controlled from
a PC via a PDP-8a interface. <br>
 <br>
The instrument is offered as is, with no implied warranty or guarantee.
Included are:  goniometer, generator, PDP-8a, radiation housing, LT
system, accessories, documentation. Offers and enquiries to:  <br>

<h3> 25 Feb 97 </h3>

Enraf-Nonius Precession camera (Model Y925) complete with full set
of screens, accessories and Polaroid cassette. Crystal to film distance
is currently 60 mm. Little used and in immaculate condition.<br>
<p>

In addition there is an Enraf-Nonius Weissenberg camera (Model Y809)
offered free to anyone who can use make use of it. Complete with
accessories. Well used but fully operational.<br>
<p>

A collection of goniometer heads with translations and arcs - probably
Unicam in origin (remember them?) have been inherited. They are rather
large by present day standards but several have been given to researchers
building (non X-ray) instruments where the positioning movements were
useful.<br>
