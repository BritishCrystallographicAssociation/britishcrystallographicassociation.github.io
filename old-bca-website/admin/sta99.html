<B><BR>Proposed changes to the Statutes and By-Laws of the<BR>British Crystallographic Association<BR>for consideration at the 1999 Annual General Meeting</B>
<HR>

<P>
Council proposes to change section E of the BCA Statutes 
 <BR>(Officers, Council and Trustees)<br>
 to reflect the following:
<UL>
<LI>Elected Members of Council shall serve for three years rather than two years
<LI>The President shall normally be limited to a single three-year term
<LI>The Past President shall continue as a Member of Council for one 
further year following the expiry of his or her term
<LI>No person may serve for more than 6 years in the same elected capacity
<LI>No person may serve on Council for more than 9 consecutive years in 
any combination of elected capacities
<LI>The length of service of co-opted Members of Council is clarified
<LI>The conditions covering Council Appointees to specific roles is clarified. The Newsletter Editor shall be a co-opted Member of Council under By-Law A. 2.
</UL>
<P>
These changes will be brought before the AGM of the BCA to be held at
Glasgow in August 1999.  If agreed, they require a small change to By-Law
E.1. (Nominations and Elections).  It is proposed that all changes shall
come into force from the year 2000.

<P>
The effect of these proposals in determining the election 
of Officers and Ordinary Members at Annual General Meetings is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The Vice-President, Secretary  and two Ordinary Members will be elected
in 1999 for two-year terms (until the AGM in 2001) under the existing
statutes and by-laws.

<LI>The President, Treasurer and one Ordinary Member will be elected in 2000 
for three-year terms under the new statutes
<LI>The Vice-President, Secretary and two ordinary members will be elected 
in 2001 for three-year terms under the new statutes
<LI>There will be no elections (unless for casual vacancies) in 2002, nor 
in every subsequent third year.  These are IUCr Congress years and the 
proposed new Statute E then ensures an experienced team to represent the 
UK at General Assemblies of the IUCr in that year.<BR>
