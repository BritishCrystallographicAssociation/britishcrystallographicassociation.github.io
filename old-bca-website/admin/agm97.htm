<I>Minutes of the BCA Annual General Meeting held on Wednesday 16 April 1997 in
the Conference Auditorium of the University of Leeds at 4:45 p.m. with the
President, Professor Michael Glazer, in the Chair. Approximately 75 people
attended.</I>
<P>
A minute's silence was observed as a mark of respect for the late Alun Bowen,
Sir Gordon Cox, Ted Maslen, and Peter Salt.
<p>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>The <B>agenda</B> was approved.</LI>
<P>
<LI>There were no <B>apologies for absence</B>.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>minutes</B> of the previous AGM (held at Cambridge on 3 April 1996)
had been published in the June 1996 issue of Crystallography News and posted
during the conference. They were approved and signed by the President. There
were no <B>matters arising</B> from them.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Secretary's Report to Council</B>, which had been published in the
March 1997 issue of Crystallography News as well as having been posted during
the conference, was accepted.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Copies of the <B>Treasurer's Report</B> were given to all members present.
Dr Steve Maginn drew attention to the figures at the bottom of page 5 of his
report. A balance of less than &pound;86,000 (at the end of 1995) had grown to
one greater than &pound;90,000 by the end of the year (1996), although the
growth was entirely due to income on the BCA long-term investments. Apart from
this income, the Association had in fact operated at a small loss. Some money
had been transfered from the General Fund to the Bursary Fund and one bursary
(&pound;200) had been returned uncashed. He congratulated Dr Paul Raithby for
the financial success of the Cambridge meeting. The apparent increase in
administrative costs was due to an unusually low figure for the previous year.
There had been a drop in the amount of cash (page 7) available to the BCA
arising from the timing of the International Union of Crystallography 1999
Congress and the Chemical Crystallography Group intensive school.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Presentation of Accounts</B>.  Regarding the forthcoming IUCr Congress
to be held in Glasgow, a limited liability charity under Scottish law had been
set up. Several thousands of pounds of BCA funds would be used: a drain at
present but rewards would follow. There would be no BCA Spring Meeting in 1999.
<B>Subscriptions</B> (page 2) had increased. Formerly GBP5 had been gathered
from each Royal Society of Chemistry member: now it was &pound;10 directly to
the BCA. Also those Institute of Physics members requesting Crystallography
News paid &pound;9 to the BCA (in addition to the &pound;3 to the IoP).
<P>
Although one of the 1996 issues of <I>Crystallography News</I> had been rather
expensive, owing to the advent of coloured covers, the situation had now been
rectified and the newsletter once again breaks even. Kate Crennell was thanked
for her editorship and for bringing in advertising revenue. The Dorothy Hodgkin
Prize was funded from interest on the &pound;7,000 in the account, but this
interest was now less than it had been recently; and a renewed appeal may now
be appropriate. Finally, Mr R Husband had been most helpful, highly efficient
and relatively inexpensive. He was re-appointed as Examining Accountant:
proposed by Dr Steve Maginn and seconded by Professor Bruce Forsyth. The
<B>accounts were accepted</B> <I>nem con</I>. The Treasurer thanked his
predecessor, Dr Anne Bloomer, for setting up excellent accounting procedures;
and he was himself thanked with a round of applause.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Election of Officers and Ordinary Members of
Council:</B>
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI><I>For Vice-President</I> - Dr Frank Allen had been
proposed by Professor Judith Howard and seconded by
Dr Paul Raithby. As his was the only nomination, he
was declared duly elected.</LI>
<P>
<LI><I>For Secretary</I> - Dr Hilary Muirhead had been
proposed by Dr Anne Bloomer and seconded by
Professor Bruce Forsyth. As hers was the only
nomination, she was declared duly elected.</LI>
<P>
<LI><I>For Ordinary Members of Council</I>
- Three nominations had been received to fill two vacancies:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI>Prof. Bob Cernik (proposed by Dr Moreton Moore and
seconded by Professor Paul Barnes);</LI>
<P>
<LI>Mr Derek Hart (proposed by Mr David Taylor and seconded by Mr Eric
Kelly);</LI>
<P>
<LI>Dr Chick Wilson (proposed by Prof. Judith Howard and seconded by Dr Frank
Allen).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
After some discussion about adequate representation on Council by all four
groups, and in particular by the Industrial Group; all three names were put
to the vote. Dr Hilary Muirhead and Dr Sandy Blake acted as tellers.
Mr Derek Hart and Dr Chick Wilson were duly elected by a
secret ballot of all members present.</LI>
<P>
The retiring Vice-President, Professor Bruce Forsyth and the retiring
Secretary, Dr Moreton Moore were thanked by the President.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Examining Accountant</B> had already been re-appointed under item 6.</LI>
<P>
<LI>As an item of <B>any other business</B>,
Professor Bill Clegg asked about the timing
of the Annual General Meeting in 1999, when there would not be the usual
BCA Spring Meeting. <B>It was decided to hold the 1999 AGM some time during
the IUCr Congress in Glasgow.</B>
</OL>
<P>
<I>The meeting closed at 17:35 and was followed by the
Bragg Lecture.</I>
