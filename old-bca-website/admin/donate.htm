<P>
It's easy to donate: simply download and complete
a <A HREF="donate.rtf">donation form</A> <I>NOW</I>! (20kb in Rich Text Format)
<P>
The generosity of BCA members in making donations to our
designated reserved funds helps keep our subscription fees
low.
<P>
Please consider making a donation when you complete your
membership form. If you pay by standing order you can always
complete a new authority to include a regular donation. If you
just want to make a one off donation then simply download the
form and send it to the
<A HREF="bcaadmin.htm">BCA Administrative Office</A>.
<P>
Donations can be allocated to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Arnold Beevers Bursary Fund</LI>
<LI>Dorothy Hodgkin Prize Fund</li>
<li>BCA General Fund</li>
</UL>
<P>
Please complete a <A HREF="giftaid.htm">Gift Aid</A> declaration if

<B>Legacies in favour of the British Crystallographic Association</B>
<P>
<I>Charity Registration 284718</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
A legacy is simply a gift that enables you to continue to
provide benefits to people or institutions after your death.
<P>
If you are considering having your Will drawn up for the first
time or perhaps re-written, you might like to include the British
Crystallographic Association amongst your list of beneficiaries.
If you already have an existing Will you might consider making a
Codicil to your Will to add a legacy to the British
Crystallographic Association.
<I>A codicil is in effect a
supplementary Will, it refers directly to the original Will and
changes or adds to it as necessary. Writing a codicil obviates
the need to re-draft the original Will</I>. The Association has
charitable status, so any gift that you make to the Association
will be exempt from Inheritance Tax and may reduce the tax
liability on your estate.
<P>
<B>General Legacy:</B>
<BR>
A general legacy is most welcome as it
enables the Association to apply funds immediately and directly
to areas where they are deemed by Council to be most needed at
that time.
<P>
<B>Bursary Fund:</B>
<BR>
Your gift will provide funding for
trainee crystallographers or those in the early years of their
careers. The fund is used to help with the costs of attending
conferences to further their knowledge and disseminate their
research.
<P>
<B>Dorothy Hodgkin Prize Fund:</B>
<BR>
Your gift will contribute
towards the cost of prizes and expenses to the recipients of this
prestigious award.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Types of Legacy</FONT></B>
<P>
There are four forms that a legacy may take:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A gift of cash.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>A gift of specific items, for example property, books,
antiques, shares.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>A gift of the balance/residue of your estate after you
have made any specific item or cash gifts and any debts, taxes or
other charges have been met. You may leave the whole of the
balance to one beneficiary or you can specify the exact
proportion that several beneficiaries may receive.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>A gift of reversionary interest which enables you to
leave your assets to a chosen beneficiary, for example a charity,
while allowing a named person, for example a relative or friend,
the benefit of them during his or her lifetime.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you wish to discuss further how you can support the
Association's work through a legacy the <I>BCA Treasurer</I> will
be happy to advise. We do however strongly recommend that you
also contact a solicitor or qualified will-writer and discuss
with them which type of legacy would be the most appropriate for
you to make, and how you can best benefit the British
Crystallographic Association after your death.
