<I>Minutes of the BCA Annual General Meeting 2001 Held on Monday 9 April in the
Palmer Building, Reading University at 4.00 p.m. with the President, Professor
Chris Gilmore, in the Chair.</I>
<P>
A short silence was observed in memory of Arnold Beevers.
<P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>The <B>agenda</B> was approved.</LI>
<P>
<LI>There were <B>apologies for absence</B> from Michael Woolfson and Chick
Wilson.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>minutes</B> of the previous AGM (held at Heriot-Watt
University, Edinburgh on 5 April 2000) had been published in the December
2000 issue of Crystallography News. They were approved and signed by the
President. There were no <B>matters arising</B> from them.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Secretary's Report to Council</B>, which had been published in the
March 2001 issue of Crystallography News, was accepted.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The proposed <B>amendments to the Statutes and By-Laws</B> had been
published in the December, 2000 issue of Crystallography News.
Frank Allen explained that this was a tidying up process which would:
<P>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>recognise that Joint Membership with the Royal
Society of Chemistry is no longer appropriate, </LI>
<P>
<LI>change the name of Sponsors to Corporate Members,</LI>
<P>
<LI>clarify the status of the original Founder Members, and</LI>
<P>
<LI>formalise the category of Honorary Members.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The acceptance of the amendments was proposed by Anne Bloomer, seconded
by Paul Raithby and carried unanimously.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Gill Houston of <B>Northern Networking reported</B>
on their activities since
they had been appointed to run the administrative side of the BCA. There were
909 members and the membership database has been transferred. There were
8 Corporate Members. In collaboration with the new Newsletter Editor the
Newsletter was now in an A4 format. Northern networking had played a major
role in the organisation of the current Spring Meeting. The number of
delegates was 266 which was a little low and members should encourage
colleagues and students to register next year.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Treasurer reported</B> that the 2000 accounts
showed major changes to the BCA funds.
The BCA had received a donation of &pound;75,000 from
IUCr99 and the fixed interest investments start to mature over the next few
years. Council would be considering the best way to invest our surplus funds.
Financial administration of the Physics Crystallography Group has
been transferred to the Institute of Physics. The administration of the Bursary
Fund has been overhauled. The Heriot-Watt Spring Meeting made a loss of
&pound;5248. The Newsletter made a profit of &pound;2714, which helped to
defray some of the &pound;5625 cost of the additional IUCr Colour Supplement.
Charges for nine months from Northern Networking are included as well as the
costs of the handover from Stephanie Harris to Northern Networking.
A Bad Debt of &pound;540 from X-ray Associates has been written off.
The Treasurer encouraged members to sign a Gift Aid Declaration.
He proposed that in future a summary of the accounts would be printed in
Crystallography News and full copies would be available on request.
The accounts were prepared by R. A. Young of The Young Company, Huntingdon.</LI>
<P>
The Treasurer for IUCr99 (Sheila Gould) handed the President a cheque for
£31,000 payable to the BCA as a final payment from the profits of the Congress.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Acceptance of Accounts</B> was proposed by Harry Powell and seconded
by Michael Glazer. The accounts were accepted <I>nem con</I>.
<P>
<LI><B>Election of Officers and Ordinary Members of Council</B>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI><I>For Vice-President</I> - Prof. Bill Clegg had been proposed
by Mrs Kate Crennell and seconded by Dr Frank Allen;
Prof. Paul Fewster had been proposed by Dr Chick Wilson and seconded by
Prof. John Finney and Dr Pam Thomas.
<P>
After a secret ballot (tellers Jeremy Cockcroft and Harry Powell)
Paul Fewster was declared duly elected.
</LI>
<P>
<LI><I>For Secretary</I> - Dr Christine Cardin had been proposed by
Dr Hilary Muirhead and seconded by Mr David Taylor.
As hers was the only nomination, she was declared duly elected.</LI>
<P>
<LI>There were no Vacancies for Ordinary Members of Council.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The President thanked Frank Allen (retiring Vice-President), Hilary Muirhead
(retiring Secretary) and Kate Crennell (retiring Newsletter Editor)
for their work on behalf of the BCA.
<P>
<LI><B>Appointment of Examining Accountant for 2001</B>.
Mr R. A. Young of The Young Company, Huntingdon was appointed as Examining
Accountant. He was proposed by Mike Glazer, seconded by Paul Fewster.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Under <B>Any Other Business</B>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI>The President reminded members that that some information was sent out by
e-mail. If they were not receiving these e-mail messages and wished to do so
they should check with the registration desk.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Judith Howard said that one reason for low attendance at this meeting was
the high registration fee and the low level of student bursaries. Elspeth
Garman also made the point that in order to boost attendance bursaries must
be increased. The Treasurer replied that the bursary level of &pound;50 per
student was tried as an experiment this year. Only 50 students had applied for
bursaries.</LI>
</UL>

<I>The meeting closed at 4.50 p.m.</I>
