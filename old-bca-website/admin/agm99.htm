<I>Minutes of the BCA Annual General Meeting 1999
held on Friday 6 August 1999 in the Boisdale Room, Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre, Glasgow at 1.00 p.m. with the President, Professor
Michael Glazer, in the Chair.</I>
<P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>The <B>agenda</B> was approved.</LI>
<P>
<LI>There were no <B>apologies for absence</B>.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>minutes</B> of the previous AGM (held at St Andrews on 7 April
1998) had been published in the June 1998 issue of <I>Crystallography
News</I> and posted. They were approved and signed by the President. There
were no <B>matters arising</B> from them.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Secretary's Report to Council</B>, which had been published
in the June 1999 issue of Crystallography News, was accepted.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Council had proposed a <B>new Statute E</B> and an <B>amendment to
By-Law E.1.</B> (see June 1999 issue of <I>Crystallography News</I>). The
main thrust of the proposals is that members of Council will be elected for
three year terms instead of two year terms. The timing will ensure that the
UK will be represented by an experienced team at General Assemblies of the
IUCr. During the discussion it was confirmed that:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI>If an elected member of Council retires early an appointment will
be made to cover the remainder of the three year term of office,</LI>
<P>
<LI>Co-opted members will be co-opted for a period of no more than three
years. They will not be able to serve more than three terms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The proposal was accepted unanimously.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Treasurer's Report</B> had been published in the June, 1999
issue of <I>Crystallography News</I>. Dr Steve Maginn drew attention to the
fact that overall the BCA has made a large operating surplus of
&pound;18,466 in 1998 as opposed to a small surplus in 1997. This is
attributable to the large profit made by the St Andrews Spring Meeting,
increased investment income and increased advertising revenue from the
Newsletter. As a result the BCA has been generous in awarding bursaries for
the IUCr meeting at Glasgow.</LI>
<P>
For the first time the Newsletter has made a small profit of &pound;262 on a
turnover of &pound;11,000. All credit to the editor - Kate Crennell.
<P>
The BCA pays two annual subscriptions to international bodies. We pay
&pound;2200 to the IUCr which will increase to &pound;3300 over the next few
years. The amount payable to the ECA is small.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Presentation of Accounts</B>. The accounts were accepted <I>nem
con</I>.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Election of Officers and Ordinary Members of Council</B>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI><I>For Vice-President</I> - Dr Frank Allen had been proposed by
Professor Guy Orpen and seconded by Dr Pam Thomas. As his was the only
nomination, he was declared duly elected.</LI>
<P>
<LI><I>For Secretary</I> - Dr Hilary Muirhead had been proposed by Dr Frank
Allen and seconded by Dr Sandy Blake. As hers was the only nomination, she
was declared duly elected.</LI>
<P>
<LI><I>For Ordinary Member of Council</I> - Mr David Taylor had been
proposed by Dr S V Norval and seconded by Mrs Kate Crennell. As his was the
only nomination, he was declared duly elected.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There remains one vacancy for an Elected Member of Council. The position
of co-opted members will be considered at the next Council Meeting.
<P>
<LI><B>Appointment of Examining Accountant for 1999</B>. Mr R A Young of
The Young Company, Huntingdon was appointed as Examining Accountant.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Under <B>Any Other Business</B>:
<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRC>
<LI>the appointment of Honorary Members was raised.
The procedure should be incorporated in the Statutes.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The President called for nominations for the Dorothy Hodgkin Prize.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Members were asked to support the BCA stand and the recruitment drive.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The President pointed out that the EPSRC had changed its procedure
for appointing Referees and Panels. The word "Crystallography" does not
appear on the nomination forms. Members were asked to write to the Chairman
of the EPSRC pointing out the importance of crystallography. The importance
of synchrotron radiation for biological research, which did not come under
the remit of the EPSRC, was also pointed out.
