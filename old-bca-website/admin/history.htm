The "X-Ray Analysis Group" of the Institute of Physics was formed in 1943.
and started sending a Newsletter to members in May 1957. At that time the
officials were:
<P>
<DL><DD>
Chairman: Professor D.G. Cox
<BR>
Vice Chairman: Sir Lawrence Bragg
<BR>
Honorary Secretary: Dr R.L. Gordon
<BR>
Ordinary members: Dr Helen D. Megaw, Dr P.T. Davies
</DD></DL>

In 1969 the name was changed to the "Crystallography Group" and in 1981 they
joined with the Crystallography Group of the Royal Society of Chemistry
to form a new Association.
<p>
The British Crystallographic Association (BCA) was founded in 1982 to advance
the education of the public in the science of crystallography, particularly
within the British Isles. It is now a Registered Charity No. 284718.
Initially there were
<A HREF="founder.htm">Founder</A> members. (This class of membership is
no longer available.) In 1998 a new class of
<A HREF="honory.htm">Honorary</A> members</a> was established, and this
was followed by the introduction of
<A HREF="/bca/welcome.htm#corp">Corporate</A> members.
Council has currently received a proposal to introduce a new class of member,
perhaps to be called "Fellows".
If you are interested in crystallography,
why not become a <A HREF="join.htm">Member</A> of the BCA?
<P>
The BCA is run by an elected <A HREF="council.htm">Council</A> according
to the "<A HREF="statutes.htm">Statutes and ByLaws</A>" of the Association.
The British Crystallographic Association is divided into four major groups:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/bca/bsg/welcome.htm">Biological Structures Group</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="/bca/ccg/ccg.html">Chemical Crystallography Group</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="/bca/pcg/welcome.htm">Physical Crystallography Group</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="/bca/ig/ig.htm">Industrial Group</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, there are special interest groups (SIGs),
e.g. synchrotron radiation and <A HREF="/bca/ed/index.html">education</A>,
which cater for specialist interests that go across two or more of
the BCA groups.
<P>
The BCA achieves its objectives by:
<UL>
<LI>Carrying out research and publishing results;</LI>
<LI>Organising conferences and meetings;</LI>
<LI>Publishing a <A HREF="/bca/cnews/index.html">Newsletter
ISSN&nbsp;1467-2790</A>;</LI>
<LI>Providing <A HREF="bursary.htm">bursaries</A> for scientific meetings
relevant to crystallography;</LI>
<LI>any other appropriate means. This has included the running of
<A HREF="/bca/meets/schools.htm">educational
teaching schools</A>, surveys of educational software,
crystal growing competitions
for school children, and compilation of lists of educational materials.
