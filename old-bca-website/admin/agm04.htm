<I>Minutes of Annual General Meeting held on Wednesday, 7th April 2004 
at 17.00 at UMIST with the President (Chick Wilson) in the Chair.

<P>
<LI>The <B>minutes</B> of the previous AGM had been published 
in the March 2004 issue of Crystallography News. 
They were approved as a correct record of the meeting as
proposed by Harry Powell, seconded by Sheila Gould.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>President’s report</B>: 
The President asked the meeting for
suggestions for increasing the membership, particularly
among Ph.D. students. Suggestions included regional
representatives to build a network, free memberships for
students, 18 months for the price of 12 (Sandy Blake), flat
fees for the whole of the Ph.D. course (Tony Bell), and a
flexible attitude to student bursaries for attending the Spring
Meeting (Richard Pauptit), but not for general bursaries.
Student members said what mattered to them most of all
was the opportunity to attend a meeting
The meeting accepted the principle of a free student trial
membership (proposed Richard Pauptit, seconded Mike
Glazer) subject to a discussion in Council.
<P>
The President reported that our IUCr fund had been
received back from the Geneva meeting and that its value
would be maintained for the 2008 IUCr meeting in Osaka.
<P>
He reported that Christine Cardin had agreed to be the
BCA representative on the ECA, and that a bid to host the
ECM in Edinburgh in 2009 had been prepared but not yet
presented. The ECA have created a Max Perutz prize which
will be presented in Budapest. 
<P>
He called for nominations for
the BCA Prize lecture to be delivered at the Spring Meeting
in 2005.</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Secretary’s report</B>: The secretary, Christine Cardin, 
presented her report, which had been published in the March 2004 issue of
Crystallography News.</LI>
<P>
<LI>The report of <B>Northern Network</B> was
presented orally. Gill Houston said that there were now only
771 members on the database. There are 11 companies
as Corporate members (80 people). She reported that
Crystallography News flourishes, and that the Spring
Meeting had 270 registered participants. There were six
new exhibitors. The Young Crystallographers sessions had
been a great success with about 70 at the sessions. The
2005 meeting has been booked for Loughborough for
the 12-14th April. Site visits will be arranged to select the
venues for 2006.
</LI>
<P>
<LI><B>Treasurer’s report</B>: The Treasurer, David Taylor,
presented a detailed report, subsequently published in
Crystallography News. He was asked why the accountants
fee had risen by 50%, and said it was due to the extra
work required by the Charities Commission. We should not
expect the same increase next year. Gift Aid is a useful form
of additional income, and so are legacies. Details of both of
these are on the website.
<P>
Chick Wilson thanked David for his tireless work on
behalf of members, and Judith Howard proposed that
the accounts be accepted. This was seconded by Chris
Gilmore. The reappointment of the accountant was also
approved. David Taylor recommended that the Young
Company be reappointed. Graham Bushnell-Wye
proposed that the meeting accept this, seconded Sheila
Gould. The discount given on membership subscriptions
to IoP members was discussed, and it was noted that the
PCG wish to maintain the present position.
<P>
The Treasurer finished by saying that he wished to stand
down in 2005.
