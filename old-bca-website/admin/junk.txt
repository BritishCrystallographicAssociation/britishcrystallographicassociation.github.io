Minutes of the BCA
Annual General
Meeting 2001
Held on Monday 9 April in the
Palmer Building, Reading
University at 4.00 p.m. with the
President, Professor Chris
Gilmore, in the Chair.
A short silence was observed in
memory of Arnold Beevers.
1. The agenda was approved.
2. There were apologies for
absence from Michael
Woolfson and Chick Wilson.
3. The minutes of the previous
AGM (held at Heriot-Watt
University, Edinburgh on 5
April 2000) had been
published in the December
2000 issue of Crystallography
News. They were approved
and signed by the President.
There were no matters
arising from them.
4. The Secretary's Report to
Council, which had been
published in the March 2001
issue of Crystallography
News, was accepted.
5. The proposed amendments to
the Statutes and By-Laws had
been published in the
December, 2000 issue of
Crystallography News. Frank
Allen explained that this was
a tidying up process which
would a) recognise that Joint
Membership with the Royal
Society of Chemistry is no
longer appropriate, b) change
the name of Sponsors to
Corporate Members, c) clarify
the status of the original
Founder Members and d)
formalise the category of
Honorary Members. The
acceptance of the
amendments was proposed
by Anne Bloomer, seconded
by Paul Raithby and carried
unanimously.
6. Gill Houston of Northern
Networking reported on their
activities since they had been
appointed to run the
administrative side of the
BCA. There were 909
members and the
membership database has
been transferred. There were
8 Corporate Members. In
collaboration with the new
Newsletter Editor the
Newsletter was now in an A4
format. Northern networking
had played a major role in
the organisation of the
current Spring Meeting. The
number of delegates was 266
which was a little low and
members should encourage
colleagues and students to
register next year.
7. The Treasurer Reported that
the 2000 accounts showed
major changes to the BCA
funds. The BCA had received a
donation of £75,000 from
IUCr99 and the fixed interest
investments start to mature
over the next few years.
Council would be considering
the best way to invest our
surplus funds. Financial
administration of the Physics
Crystallography Group has
been transferred to the
Institute of Physics. The
administration of the Bursary
Fund has been overhauled. The
Heriot-Watt Spring Meeting
made a loss of £5248. The
Newsletter made a profit of
£2714, which helped to defray
some of the £5625 cost of the
additional IUCr Colour
Supplement. Charges for nine
months from Northern
Networking are included as
well as the costs of the
handover from Stephanie
Harris to Northern Networking.
A Bad Debt of £540 from X-ray
Associates has been written
off. The Treasurer encouraged
members to sign a Gift Aid
Declaration. He proposed that
in future a summary of the
accounts would be printed in
Crystallography News and full
copies would be available on
request. The accounts were
prepared by R. A. Young of
The Young Company,
Huntingdon.

AGM 2001 BCA Prize Lecture
The Treasurer for IUCr99
(Sheila Gould) handed the
President a cheque for
£31,000 payable to the BCA
as a final payment from the
profits of the Congress.
8. The Acceptance of Accounts
was proposed by Harry Powell
and seconded by Michael
Glazer. The accounts were
accepted nem con.
9. Election of Officers and
Ordinary Members of Council
For Vice-President - Professor
Bill Clegg had been proposed
by Mrs Kate Crennell and
seconded by Dr Frank Allen.
Professor Paul Fewster had
been proposed by Dr Chick
Wilson and seconded by
Professor John Finney and Dr
Pam Thomas. After a secret
ballot (tellers Jeremy
Cockcroft and Harry Powell)
Paul Fewster was declared
duly elected.
For Secretary - Dr Christine
Cardin had been proposed by
Dr Hilary Muirhead and
seconded by Mr David Taylor.
As hers was the only
nomination, she was declared
duly elected.
There were no Vacancies for
Ordinary Members of Council.
The President thanked Frank
Allen (retiring Vice-President),
Hilary Muirhead (retiring
Secretary) and Kate Crennell
(retiring Newsletter Editor)
for their work on behalf of
the BCA.
10. Appointment of Examining
Accountant for 1999. Mr R. A.
Young of The Young
Company, Huntingdon was
appointed as Examining
Accountant. He was proposed
by Mike Glazer, seconded by
Paul Fewster.
11. Any Other Business
The President reminded
members that that some
information was sent out by
e-mail. If they were not
receiving these e-mail
messages and wished to do so
they should check with the
registration desk.
Judith Howard said that one
reason for low attendance at this
meeting was the high
registration fee and the low level
of student bursaries. Elspeth
Garman also made the point that
in order to boost attendance
bursaries must be increased. The
Treasurer replied that the bursary
level of £50 per student was tried
as an experiment this year. Only
50 students had applied for
bursaries.
The meeting closed at 4.50 p.m.

Nominations for the
BCA Prize Lecture
Nominations are sought for the
BCA Prize Lecture. The system is a
little unusual but works as
follows:
1. It is called the 'BCA Prize
Lecture' and can be awarded
to any crystallographer in the
world, but is named in honour
of a prominent British
crystallographer; this name
would change with each
award. So we would have, for
example, 'The BCA Prize
Lecture in honour of XXX'.
2. The crystallographer in whose
honour it is given would
attend the BCA Meeting and
present the prize. Their
expenses would be paid for by
the BCA. There should be some
link between the work of the
two people involved.
3. The recipient would receive
full travel costs, and would
give a lecture at the BCA
Meeting.
4. Nominations for this award, to
be presented at the
Nottingham BCA Spring
Meeting are now sought. They
should be sent to the
Secretary, Dr Chris Cardin
whose address can be found in
the list of BCA officers. They
should be received by February
1st 2001. Nominations should
include a summary of the
achievements of the two
crystallographers involved.
