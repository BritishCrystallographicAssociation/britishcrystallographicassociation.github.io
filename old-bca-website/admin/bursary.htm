<B>Applying for Bursaries in 2008/9</B>
<P>
Arnold Beevers Bursaries are available to members (see below) and only <A HREF="bursform.htm"> on-line applications</A> are accepted.

<P>
<B>Bursaries for the
<A HREF="http://www.crystallography-meetings.org.uk/">BCA
York Spring Meeting</A> (8-10 April 2008)</B>
<P>
A limited number of bursaries are available from the Arnold
Beevers Bursary Fund to cover the cost of registration,
two nights basic accommodation, and food (including conference dinner).
The bursary will not
cover travel expenses and recipients will be expected to present
a <A HREF="/bca/meets/bca06/bca06.htm#abstract">poster</A>.
Council is seeking commercial sponsors of Spring
Meeting Bursaries and it is hoped to again offer some <B>Named
Bursaries</B> at this meeting. The closing date for all applications
is 4th February 2008 (as per abstract deadline)
and you must <A HREF="bursform.htm">apply online</A>.

<P>
<B>Bursaries for other BCA Meetings and Schools</B>
<P>
These are administered directly by the organisers of the
Meeting or Teaching School. They will publicise the procedure for
their bursary applications, whether funded by the BCA itself or a
constituent group.
<P>
<B>General Bursaries</B>
<P>
Arnold Beevers Bursaries are available to members (see point
(a) below) who wish to attend relevant scientific meetings in the
UK or abroad, which are not organised by the BCA. All applications
are considered by the BCA Bursary Committee, comprising the
President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary and are guided
by the following considerations:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The bursaries are primarily intended to support <I>bona fide</I>
research students and postdoctoral workers who are BCA members.
Applications from those with more senior non-tenured positions,
and from those in junior permanent positions where university or
industrial funds are unavailable, may be supported at the
discretion of the BCA Bursary Committee if BCA funds are
available.
</LI>
<LI>Applicants must normally have been a BCA member for 6
months before applying.
</LI>
<LI>Applicants will not normally be considered if they have
been awarded a general bursary in the previous two years.
</LI>
<LI>Preference will be given to applicants who have attended
a BCA meeting. Applications must be received at least 6 weeks
before the date of the meeting/visit. No retrospective
applications are possible.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Successful applicants are expected to submit a word-processed
short scientific report on the meeting/visit soon after their
return; this should include details of the sessions attended and
of the applicant's presentation. The reports may be submitted via
electronic mail to the BCA Administrative Office and may be
published later in
<A HREF="/bca/on-line/on-line.htm"><I>Crystallography News</I></A>
or on the web.
