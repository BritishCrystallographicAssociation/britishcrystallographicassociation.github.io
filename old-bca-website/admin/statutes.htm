<h3> Version 5, 26 April 2000</h3>
Amendments to Statute E  and By-Law E.1. were approved at the 1999 AGM,
where the above wording was agreed.<br><br>
Further amendments to Statute B concerned with the new honorary membership
category were discussed at the 1999 AGM; other changes concerning Joint
Groups, their status and financial arrangements concerning them are due to
the decision of the Chemical Crystallography Group's decision to sever their
connection with the Royal Society of Chemistry which took place in 1997.<br>

 The above wording is proposed for discussion at the AGM 2001.
Please make your comments on these changes to any
<a href="council.htm">Council Member</a> preferably
before the next Council meeting in October 2000.
<h3> Version 4, 4th April 1990, by resolution of AGM.</h3>
