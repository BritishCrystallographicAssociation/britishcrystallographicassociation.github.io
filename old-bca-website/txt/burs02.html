IN 2002</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bursary fund was renamed the Arnold Beevers Bursary Fund
in April 2001 and endowed with £20,000 from the funds received from Crystal
Congress Glasgow. BCA Council gratefully acknowledges several generous
donations to the fund in its first few months of operation and welcomes further
contributions to this worthwhile cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>GIFT AID: </b>The funds have also been boosted by a
council decision to allocate Gift Aid refunds to the Arnold Beevers Bursary
Fund. The 2001 Gift Aid refund of  £668.32 has added to the fund and council
thanks the 183 members who have signed a gift aid declaration and contributed
to the claim. Members who haven't already done so and are eligible for the
scheme are encouraged to sign a Gift Aid declaration. Your membership renewal
documents for 2002 will advise you if you have already signed a form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Applying for Bursaries in 2002</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bursaries for Nottingham Spring Meeting (25- 28 March
2002):</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A limited number of bursaries are available from the Arnold
Beevers Bursary Fund to cover the £165 three day accommodation package and £15
student conference dinner at Nottingham (Student Registration is Free). The
bursary will not cover travel expenses and recipients will be expected to
present a poster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Council is seeking commercial sponsors of Spring Meeting
Bursaries and it is hoped to offer some Named Bursaries at this meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>closing date</b> for all applications is <b>25th
January 2002</b>, applicants should ask for an Arnold Beevers bursary
application form from the BCA Administrative Office (details below).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bursaries for other BCA Meetings and Schools:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are administered directly by the organisers of the
Meeting or Teaching School. They will publicise the procedure for their bursary
applications, whether funded by the BCA itself or a constituent group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>General Bursaries:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arnold Beevers Bursaries are available to members, (see
point (a) below) who wish to attend relevant scientific meetings in the UK or
abroad which are not organised by the BCA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All applications are considered by the BCA Bursary
Committee, comprising the President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary
and are guided by the following considerations: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) The bursaries are primarily intended to support bona
fide research students and postdoctoral workers who are BCA members.
Applications from those with more senior non-tenured positions, and from those
in junior permanent positions where university or industrial funds are
unavailable, may be supported at the discretion of the BCA Bursary Committee if
BCA funds are available. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Applicants must normally have been a BCA member for 6
months before applying. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c) Applicants will not normally be considered if they have
been awarded a general bursary in the previous two years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(d) Preference will be given to applicants who have attended
a BCA meeting. Applications must be received at least 6 weeks before the date
of the meeting/visit. No retrospective applications are possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Successful applicants are expected to submit a
word-processed short scientific report on the meeting/visit soon after their
return; this should include details of the sessions attended and of the applicant's
presentation. The reports may be submitted via electronic mail to the <a
href="../My%20Documents/Dell/BCA/My%20Documents/Dell/BCA/Treasurer/member.html#admin"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'> BCA Administrative Office </span></a> and
may be published later in '<em>Crystallography News</em>'. </p>
