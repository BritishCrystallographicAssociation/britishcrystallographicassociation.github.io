<h2><a name="792">The Importance of Quality Assurance on X-ray
Diffraction Laboratories.</a></h2>

<p>The meeting, held at BP Research, Sunbury on Thames an 9th
July, attracted delegates from
 over 30 industrial and academic
X-ray laboratories. Of these, only 4 had some form of
accreditation.</p>

<p>The meeting started with the reminder:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 6em">
<p>Measurement is easy.</p>

<p>Getting the right answer is difficult.</p>

<p>Convincing others that it's right is even more difficult.</p>
</div>

<p>It is so easy "to do the right things" rather than "do things
right." We are all consumers of measurements and the supplier
should have some traceability to a 
nationally accepted standard -
if one exists. Customers buy products which we, by virtue of
x-ray measurements, have had input to. These measurements need
not be of high accuracy but the result should be adequate for the
intended purpose. Objectivity and subjectivity are both important
in X-ray world. When obtaining results, is there a procedure that
is followed to guarantee control of the experiment, so that we
can demonstrate that all appropriately trained staff would obtain
the same result - with
in acceptable limits? If we resort to the
use of software for obtaining these results have we fully
validated the software - be it of in house or commercial
origin?</p>

<p>Brian Kent (NAMAS) and Norman Deeley (British Standards) were
invited to describe their own schemes and the requirements for
accrediting the procedures in use in laboratories for obtaining
results. Both stressed that their schemes were complementary.
NAMAS specialise in testing and their emphasis is on measurement
- whether it 
be by a well defined national standard or an
in-house method. BS are more concerned with the product, its
design and the management of its manufacture. This product can be
information and knowledge. Each of these standards has a number
of clauses that requires a procedure - if they are applicable.
These procedures will show that one has a means of agreeing with
ones customer what he/she wants, a policy for supplying him/her,
a well defined method of how one proposes to do it, and a system
of record 
keeping to demonstrate ones achievements. Inherent in
these will be staff training, calibration, accuracy assessment,
maintenance, standards, etc.. The procedures are the heart of
accreditation, with validation methods, measurement traceability
and reports of considerable importance.</p>

<p>The following questions were put to the delegates:</p>

<p>"Would another laboratory accept your in-house
procedures?"</p>

<p>"What statement do you make at the end of the test - how sure
are you that you h
ave the right answer and what is the
(justified) error in it?"</p>

<p>"Is your computer software fully validated and fully
documented before use and by whom?"</p>

<p>"Can you demonstrate that appropriately trained staff will,
within defined limits, obtain the same answer by following a set
procedure?"</p>

<p>The last question is the one used to assess the subjective
element in a test. We have few standard samples or nationally
documented procedures and one suggestion was that we should
excha
nge amongst ourselves those that we have or have round robin
test pieces. The "garbage in, garbage out" saying may be true
about computer operations but good quality data gathered in an
objective manner could still lead to the wrong answer if the
software is unvalidated or there is a high subjective input into
the result evaluation. Both organisations will accredit
objectivity but not subjectivity.</p>

<p>QA, i.e. quality assurance and not quantitative analysis as
one person thought, is probably p
ractised in a non-formal way in
most laboratories. Those who have achieved accreditation will
confirm that although it is not easy it does have benefits. Not
only does it make one think deeply about the claims that one
makes but customer confidence and that of staff and management is
boosted. There is less rework and the improved efficiency results
in reduced operating costs.</p>

<h2><a name="691">CONTROL OF STRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
0F CRY
STALLINE MATERIALS</a></h2>

<h3>ICI CHEMICALS AND POLYMERS, RUNCORN. 19th JUNE 1991</h3>

<p>More then 80 delegates attended this one day meeting held in
the Conference Centre at ICI in Runcorn. This meeting was jointly
sponsored by the Particle Technology Group of the Institution of
Chemical Engineers, the British Association for Crystal Growth
and the industrial Group of the BCA with the general aim to
addressing the role of structure and mechanical properties in the
definition of particulate p
rocesses.</p>

<p>The theme of the morning's talks were the structural aspects
of crystallisation associated with such processes at the
molecular level. The session was opened with a paper by J.
Garside (Chemical Engineering, UMIST) who gave a detailed
overview on the parameters that must be considered to obtain the
desired structure and related properties of a material during
crystallisation processes. Factors such as supersaturation,
kinetics, polymorphism, crystal size distribution and mixing we
re
individually examined with relevant examples illustrating each
point.</p>

<p>A comprehensive introduction to polymorphism was presented by
T. Threlfall (Chemistry, University of York). Adopting a
"practical approach" he described identification of polymorphism,
production of phase diagrams using thermodynamic considerations,
and a third structural approach trying to relate polymorphism
with molecular structure. He laid the basis for the afternoon's
discussion by outlining that, although regula
tory bodies may not
be demanding such information, the pharmaceutical scientist should
be pursuing it in order to alleviate the range of formulation
problems caused by polymorphism.</p>

<p>A talk by J. Anwar (Pharmacy. Kings College) followed and
continued the morning's theme with a detailed examination of the
mechanisms of polymorphic solid-state phase transformations
Normal reaction kinetics are inapplicable in this area, with
various factors that have to be considered, e.g. the spatial
distrib
ution of nuclei and the nucleation and growth mechanisms
of the new solid phase. Ideally measurements may he based on
large single crystals, however in practice this is not applicable
for many systems and measurements must be based on
polycrystalline and powder samples. Normally a reaction may only
be followed by consideration of the fraction of a system
transformed. Extraction of a rate constant for these reactions
have been the subject of many theories, all of which assume that
reactions will cont
inue to completion if given sufficient time.
Studies on sulphathiazole indicate that the solid- state
transformation does not always continue to completion and that the
rate and extent of reaction is dependent on temperature. This was
explained in terms of nucleation in different sites characterised
by different energies of activation.</p>

<p>N. Shankland (Pharmacy. University of Strathclyde) presented a
paper on "Structural Control of Crystallisation in Chiral
Systems". Initially describing the i
mportance of investigation
into the crystallisation of optical isomers, and the part that
separation plays in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical
industries he outlined the importance of the classical
experiments undertaken by Pasteur. He then described how modern
techniques were being employed to answer the question as to why
mixtures of isomers can crystallise in three very distinct
phases. These phases are, he explained, readily distinguished by
single crystal x-ray diffraction and their thermo-s
tability can
now be related directly to crystal structure. This, he concluded,
would result in a better understanding of any separation process
which could be developed to gain optically pure materials.</p>

<p>The afternoon's talks, devoted to the relationship between
structure and mechanical properties of a system, was opened by J.
N. Sherwood (Chemistry, University of Strathclyde) who lectured
on "Structure, Strain and Mechanical Properties in Relation to
Crystal Grouth."</p>

Professor Sherwo
od began his talk by describing how bulk chemical
production due to crystallisation invariably caused deformation
of the developing crystals because of a number of effects. This
deformation has an important role to play In growth rates and
defect structure of the growing crystals. These defects can
determine the characteristics of the solid and, in fact,
influence the eventual use of the material. He went on than
describe how these detects can be assessed experimentally, in a
series of experiments w
hich involved a standard kinetic growth
cell which was used to gauge growth rates as a function of
strain. Further, the use of transmission topographic techniques
allowed dislocation analysis and the mosaic spread of
microcrystals from secondary nucleation was analysed by Laue
techniques.The quality of the results obtained from the latter
two techniques were enhanced with the use of synchrotron
radiation.<br>
<br>
 

<p>The two following presentations highlighted the growing
relevance of an appr
eciation of crystal form in relation to
powder technology and therefore to the pharmaceutical sciences,
hitherto described by some as an "art form".</p>

<p>J. J. Dijksterhuis (DMV. The Netherlands) gave a review of
lactose as an excipient in the dry dosage form discussing the
history for, and rationale of its use. By describing the
differences between two commonly chosen forms of the material
(spray dried and amorphous) he explained how the largely
crystalline spray dried material, under compressi
on will fragment
and form good compacts because of the generation of many more
inter-particulate binding sites. In contrast the amorphous
material, being less brittle, will deform plastically but will
also form good compacts under compression.</p>

<p>M. Aulton (Pharmacy, Leicester Polytechnic) expanded on this
by noting that hard elastic materials would give rise to poor
quality compacts in contrast to the better compacts produced by
ductile, or fragmentary materials. He described methods for
qua
ntifying the crystalline nature of materials and drew on <font
face="Symbol">a</font> -lactose as well as other pharmaceutically
relevant materials to illustrate this argument.</p>

<p>Closing an excellent and stimulating meeting was a paper given
by m. Ghadari (Chemical Engineering, University of Surrey) who
spoke on "Studies of Attrition Processes in Crystalline Solids
Using Controlled Rate Impact Fracture." Here he explored the link
between the rate of attrition of particulate solids and the
phy
sical and mechanical properties of solids. By expanding on
previous theories that the rate of attrition could be linked to
the appearance of sub-surface lateral cracks, he described how
these cracks could be used to describe the loss per impact from
the particle properties and impact velocity. He highlighted his
talk with results on cubic systems such as Mg0, NaCI and KCl as
achieved on apparatus discussed comprehensively later in the
talk.</p>

 SPECIAL INTEREST SYMPOSIUM<br>
 MICROSTRUCTURAL PROPERTIES FROM LINE PROFILE ANALYSIS</a></h2>

<p>This symposium was held at ICI Runcorn on 15th February and
was organised by Ian Langford and Steve Fletcher. The interest in
the topic proved to be far greater than the organisers had
expected: there were 60 applications to attend but unfortunately
space only allowed 40 to be accommodated on
 the day.</p>

<p>The symposium began with lan Langford covering various aspects
of background theory, including sources of line broadening, line
profile shape functions, deconvolution and requirements for data
quality. This was followed by Steve Fletcher discussing the
various experimental factors involved in obtaining a "pure" line
profile, including the choice of a standard for deconvolution.
Steve went on to describe the Warren Averbach method and some
single-line techniques for obtaining both 
crystallite sire and
strain, using an ICI catalyst as an example to demonstrate the
application of these approaches and the agreement between
them.</p>

<p>In the final presentation before lunch, Steve Andrews (ICI)
described the application of the Williamson-Hall approach to the
determination of size and strain in a magnesium hydroxide
sample.</p>

<p>The afternoon session began with lan Langord discussing the
use of total pattern fitting to determine size and strain,
particularly applicable wh
ere it was difficult to measure
individual reflections. Steve Andrews described the use of the
Daresbury synchrotron source to obtain good quality pure line
profiles, followed by Bill David of Rutherford Laboratory who
demonstrated how the fundamental understanding of the line shape
of the SNS was enabling precise fits to line profiles to be
achieved. The art contribution, by Ivan Hall (UMIST) described
attempts to obtain microstructural information on polymers
(Kevlar and LDPE) by fitting a distrib
ution function to higher
order Fourier coefficients. Ian Ferguson (Springfields) then
discussed some examples from the nuclear industry including
surface coatings and corrosion layers. This talk finished</p>

<p>with a demonstration given by Tony Bell (Springfields) of an
IBM PC program to determine crystallite size and shape.</p>

<p>The meeting concluded with presentations by the major
instrument suppliers of the range and capabilities of their
size-strain software. These were given by Reg Nicho
lls (Philips)
and Marcus Winter (Siemens).</p>

<p>One possible criticism of the symposium was that it did not
offer the opportunity for those less experienced in line profile
analysis to raise and discuss their problems. It is therefore
likely that, in the future, the Industrial Group will hold two
types of meeting on this subject:</p>

<ol>
<li>A basic workshop which will be limited to small numbers and
will take the form of a round-table discussion of individuals'
specific problems and applic
ations.</li>

<li>A symposium with prepared presentations and contributions on
techniques and applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>The success of this meeting and the unexpected demand has
certainly demonstrated that there are many people using line
profile analysis on a wide range of real problems and that there
is a general and widespread interest in the topic throughout the
industrial X-ray diffraction community.</p>
