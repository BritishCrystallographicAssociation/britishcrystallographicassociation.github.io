<p>The meeting began with an introduction by <strong>Jeremy Cockcroft</strong>,
the Industrial Group Chair, who thanked Pilkington for hosting
the meeting and providing lunch. He commented that it was good to
see the meeting return to the site of an industrial company. The
sessions started with an introduction to Pilkington by <strong>Mary
Ormsby</strong>, a senior manager on site. Fairly recently, Pilkington was
taken over by the Japanese glass company NSG - half its size -
and the two organisations are slowly merging. Whereas Pilkington
had in recent years majored on building and automotive products,
NSG has a lot of hi-tech applications. The next few months will
be an interesting time as the cultures merge.</p>
<p>The first scientific talk of the day was by <strong>Gordon Barr</strong> (U. of
Glasgow), who spoke about high throughput screening with XRPD and
Raman. In both cases, full profile patterns are compared, using
both parametric and nonparametric statistics. Correlation
coefficients are calculated from which a distance matrix is set
up. Finally various techniques for cluster analysis are applied.
The result is a robust and rapid method of grouping data on large
groups of samples.</p>
<p>The next speaker was an old friend, <strong>Ian Ferguson</strong>, who
described the characterisation of SiC coatings on nuclear reactor
fuel pellets. This amounted to an interesting reminder of the
value of relatively simple approaches to strain analysis. Some of
this work went back a long way - how many of us remember computer
data entry on 5-hole punch tape? - but it is still relevant.</p>
<p>The last speaker in the morning session was <strong>Ivan Parkin </strong>(UCL)
who talked about XRPD mapping of CVD coatings on glass. WO<sub>3</sub>
coatings are always the same polymorph, but crystallite
morphology and orientation vary with the reagent used to
hydrolyse WCl<sub>6</sub>. The surfaces can be highly hydrophilic: on the
other hand, if the coating is of WSe<sub>2</sub>, then the surface will be
very hydrophobic. This comparison led on to a discussion of
different models for the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of
surfaces, and a comparison with various TiO<sub>2</sub>-based films.</p>
<p>During the lunch break, we enjoyed a tour of the exhibition
area - so interesting did we find it that two of the three
parties were late back, and the afternoon session got under way a
little behind schedule. <strong>Mark Farnworth</strong> (Pilkington) led with a
description of how XRPD and X-ray reflectivity can be used in the
glass industry. Estimation of the proportion of amorphous
material is important but because it is always compositionally
similar, a simple method can be used. Silver in coatings on glass
shows marked preferred orientation, which can be seen by XRD at
different angles of incidence.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Hodge</strong> (BP) spoke next, describing some of the varied
work he carries out on a wide range of samples associated with
chemicals, oils and their applications. He compared the use of
XRD in its 80's heyday of seven instruments and 9 staff to
today's two instruments and one staff. Recent modernisation and
migration to new instruments includes an old high temperature 30
bar pressure + temperature chamber with a sophisticated reactive
gas flow system used for catalyst studies.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Morris</strong> (Morris Analytical X-Ray) had chosen the title
"Dog Food 'n Diffraction" for an interesting talk; the various
reactions of members of the audience made an amusing study in
human nature. Polyphosphates find a lot of uses in meat products,
but some of them have undesirable properties. Trisodium hydrogen
pyrophosphate is useful but not easily prepared, and Richard had
been involved with a project that found a route to a crystalline
form of it. The product is analysed by XRPD, the results from
which agree well with <sup>31</sup>P NMR.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Staddon</strong> (U. of Nottingham) had a similarish title, "XRD
'n Chips" - silicon chips to be precise, and other
semiconductors, particularly III-V's but especially Ga(As,N).
This occurs in the two ZnS structures and, with doping, atoms on
unexpected lattice or interstitial sites and so on, form a
complex group of species. The determination of Mn, and of where
in the lattice it is to be found in GaMnAs, is a complex task for
which a combination of XRF and XRD has proved reasonably
successful.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Smith</strong> (Shell, Thornton) told us about some of the work
he has done over the years on samples associated with the
application of oil products. Pitting of a valve from an
aero-engine was found to be associated with a deposit of Pb<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>5</sub>,
a high-temperature oxidation product of the valve material, whose
presence indicated excessive engine temperatures. Fuel starvation
in a petrol engine was found to be due to a blocked filter in the
petrol tank. The blockage was shown by XRPD to contain Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Cu,
CuO and graphite. The first was rust, but the others derived from
wear of the (totally immersed) electric fuel pump's commutator
and brushgear. These and other examples made this a fascinating
talk. Another old technique which had come in handy was a
Debye-Scherrer camera, useful with very small samples.</p>
<p>The last talk was by <strong>Peter Stacey</strong> (HSL, Buxton) who also
talked about his work. The main topic of his talk was the
quantification of crystalline SiO<sub>2</sub> in air samples. The
recently-reduced WEL is now 0.1 mg m<sup>-3</sup>; while there
are calls for lower limits, the difficulty of analysis would make
them hard to enforce. At the proposed level of 0.04 mg
m<sup>-3</sup>, the interlaboratory uncertainty would lead to
relative 95 % confidence limits around &plusmn; 50 % for 4 hours
measurement. Large samples require corrections for absorption of
X-rays, which would be an added complication. He concluded with
further examples relating to asbestos and calcium phosphates.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an interesting meeting in an excellent
venue, and the thirty-odd participants went home well
satisfied.</p>
