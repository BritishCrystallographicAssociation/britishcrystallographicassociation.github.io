<h1>Structural Elucidation of Organic and Pharmaceutical
Materials by laboratory XRD</h1>


<h2>Roche Discovery, Welwyn, 18th March 1998.</h2>

<p>The meeting, which was attended by 60 people, was the second
to be held under the auspices of the Industrial Group of the
British Crystallographic Association and follows successful
meetings in the two previous years. The meeting was opened by Dr
Mike Atwood of Roche Discovery who took the opportunity to
explain the increasing importance of crystallographic techniques
to the company and the success they were having in obtaining
structural i
nformation from X-ray powder data.</p>

<p><strong>Prof. Daniel Louer</strong> of the University of
Rennes then discussed his approach to structure analysis from
powder data with laboratory X-rays. Since 1986 his group has been
successful in solving from scratch thirty structures. They
include cases with unit cell volumes as large as 7471A and up to
29 atoms in the asymmetric cell. He stresses the importance of
precision in peak position which was attainable with correctly
adjusted diffractometers,
 e.g. average discrepancies of 0.005deg
two theta.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Jeremy Cockcroft</strong> of Birkbeck College then
spoke on the topic of sample preparation and data collection.
This depended firstly on the purpose of the data collection and
secondly on the possible means of obtaining the data. With these
decided time should the be spent preparing a pure sample,
preparing the sample, collecting high resolution and high quality
data, plotting data and determining peak positions, indexing
peaks
 and refining lattice parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Mary Jane Tremayne</strong> of the University of
St Andrews then explained the practical aspects of Rietveld
Refinement. She explained the technique uses a least squares
refinement of the whole pattern to generate best fit and that it
makes no attempt to match intensities or to allow for overlap.
Experience has shown that it is better to use restraints rather
than constraints when optimising the data and examination of the
residuals provides str
ong clues as to the nature of any error in
the fit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Steve Norval</strong> then updated the meeting on
the progress that was being made towards introducing an European
X-ray diffraction standard. The standard is required for the
accreditation of laboratories and in the support of patents. The
draft is expected by May 1999 and once adopted it is expected to
become an International Standard.</p>

<p><strong>Prof. Bill David &amp; Dr Ken Shankland</strong> of
the ISIS facility then
 related the considerable success they were
having using their approach to Ab-Initio structure determination.
They collect high quality data at angles beyond those usually
used for indexing and then use the genetic algorithm and
simulated annealing, which avoid false local minima on the
response surface, to generate theoretical powder patterns which
they then compare with the experimental data. Their approach can
handle ionic structures and real molecules that are flexible and
it has been used to so
lve the structure of compounds from camphor
to capsaicin.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Chris Frampton</strong> then presented a paper on
the isolation and crystallisation of the elusive orthorhombic
polymorph of paracetomol. The work had been undertaken as part of
a tripartite project between Roche, Pfizer and SKB and the
Universities of Bradford, Surrey and Strathclyde. Early attempts
at isolating Form II were unsuccessful but it was found that Form
II was produced when the molten Form I was cooled. This ma
terial
was then used to seed saturated solutions of the drug. This
procedure produced the required form provided the product was
harvested within 30 minutes to prevent reversion to form I.
Examination of Form II has revealed that it can, unlike Form I,
be used for direct compression formulations.</p>

<p>The final presentation was by <strong>Dr Arndt Kern</strong>
of Bruker AXS who presented information on the various powder
X-ray equipment available. The meeting was closed by Mr David
Taylor who 
thanked those who had contributed to making the day a
success. The Industrial Group would like to thank Philips
Analytical and Bruker AXS for subsidising the meeting.</p>

<h1>Report of Industrial Group Annual Spring Meeting, 1998, St
Andrews</h1>

<p>A full programme, set in delightful if wet St Andrews,
resulted in good attendances at the Industrial Group
presentations (and at the Sunday evening Ceilidh!).</p>

<h2>Plen
ary Lecture - Order and Disorder in Block Copolymer
Systems.</h2>

<p><strong>Patrick Fairclough</strong> presented a paper on order
and disorder in polymer systems. Using an extruder with a slit
die he and his co-workers have investigated the crystallisation
of homo and co-polymers on extrusion. By using synchrotron
radiation and simultaneously measuring the wide (WAXS) and small
angle X-Ray scattering (SAXS), they have concluded that
homopolymers initially crystallise by spinodal decomposition an
d
not by nucleation, whilst copolymer behaviour depends upon block
length. Results were presented for both SAXS/WAXS and grazing
incidence SAXS/reflectivity.</p>

<p align="RIGHT"><em>Bruce Fox</em></p>

<hr>
<p>The subject for the first <strong>Industrial Group
Session</strong> was "<strong><em>Data Quality -Fit for the
Purpose</em></strong>", with Mary Vickers (Cambridge University)
chairing the session.</p>

<p><strong>Ron Jenkins (ICDD)</strong> spoke first, on the
problems of preparing an
d identifying samples. The subjects
covered ranged from how to mix samples, getting good counting
statistics to the problems of data collection and the advantages
and disadvantages of internal and external standards. He then
went on to review developments in the Powder Diffraction File
(PDF). These include the imminent inclusion of calculated
patterns from the Karlsruhe Inorganic Crystal Structure Database
( taking the total number of patterns to about 110,000 ), and the
development of the PDF third
 level full pattern version.</p>

<p><strong>Jamshad Anwar (King's College London)</strong> then
talked about the difficulties of analysing organic materials,
with particular reference to pharmaceuticals. The complexities of
polymorphs, hydrates, phase instabilities during grinding, low
symmetry, low scattering and the presence of texture make these
compounds particularly difficult to analyse. Profile fitting and
Rietveld analysis were reviewed and the limitations of both
techniques were discussed.
 Those of us in the audience who work
on well behaved metallic crystalline materials were extremely
grateful that our samples are not as difficult as this to work
on!</p>

<p><strong>Richard Todd ( University of Manchester ).</strong>
showed how the old-established techniques of line broadening can
be applied to new equipment on new materials to provide
information that cannot be obtained in any other way. Richard is
studying Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SiC ceramic composites for
wear applications
 and has used peak shift and line broadening
from neutron scattering data (collected on the HRPD in the ISIS
facility) to obtain size and residual stress data for the
different crystallites in his materials. He emphasised that one
type of analysis is not sufficient to get the answer - you
require several means of analysis to achieve the correct
answer.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Knight (RAL)</strong> finished the session with
a talk on the wide applications of neutron diffraction. He began
by briefly d
escribing time of flight neutron diffraction and then
demonstrated the unique problem solving capabilities of the
technique. Examples ranged from the structure of Russelite
(showing light atom sensitivity) to octahedral cation site
ordering in Olivine, and the structure of fast ion conductors in
fuel cells.</p>

<p>The session provided a valuable insight into how various
techniques can ( and possibly more importantly cannot ) be used ,
and showed that only by choosing the right combination of data

collection and analysis can you hope to get "the right
answer".</p>

<strong>The Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture</strong> was presented
by <strong>Prof. Bob Snyder</strong> of the Ohio State
University. Titled "<em>The Development of X-ray Analysis</em>,"
Prof Snyder painted a broad tapestry of X-ray utilisation,
starting with Roentgen in 1895 and finishing with the latest
methods such as grazing incidence
 and EXAFS. Pointing out that,
within 15 years of Roentgen's discovery most of the tools
available today had been defined, each specific discovery was
exemplified with slides of the original work followed by its
development and the latest implementation of that idea. As
examples of the modern scene, the arrival of synchrotron
radiation with its wavelength tunability has led to EXAFS and
XANES analysis of poorly crystalline materials. The precision of
high resolution instruments has revealed fundamen
tals of
superconductivity, and grazing incidence has opened the door to
thin film analysis. Time dependent studies are now readily
achievable, allowing reactions to be followed together with, for
example, phase transitions, kinetics, etc. A thoroughly
fascinating review of our field, and a superb re-statement of the
utility of X-rays.</p>

<p align="RIGHT"><em>Bruce Fox</em></p>

<hr>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Hardware and Software
Developments.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Marcus Winter</s
trong> of Bruker AXS presented a range
of hardware (for XRD, single crystal, area and Position Sensitive
detectors) available from Bruker, concentrating on the new D8
diffractometer. With modular design, features of the goniometer
were detailed as: accuracy and reproducibility 0.0001deg; an 11cm
concentric hole on the goniometer axis for large samples;
variable diameter measuring circles to take advantage of parallel
beam geometry and focusing mirrors; a wide dynamic range
scintillation counter. The
 capability of examining a wide range
of samples was stressed, from engine crankshafts to capillaries
and fibres. New, 32bit software completes the package. Finally, a
new x,y,z translation stage for microdiffractometry (50<em>m</em>
spot size) was detailed, for use with the GADDS area
detector.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Pennartz</strong> of Nonius BV detailed the use
of the 120deg curved plate detector, pointing out the advantages
of this arrangement for time resolved studies. The goniometer is
provid
ed with a central hole capable of taking a range of
fitments. An example of clay mineral analysis was presented:
using a micro-well holder, 1.75mm x 0.03mm, similar results were
obtained to using normal holders. As an example of time
resolution, the intercalation of montmorillonite by water was
shown at 5 second intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Celeste Reiss</strong> of Philips next presented the
Xpert MRD goniometer. The leading innovation here was claimed to
be the introduction of "plug-in" optical mod
ules. Tube
orientation from spot to line focus can be achieved by simple
rotation of the tube holder, and 2 plug in modules can be
accommodated after the tube. The various modules are: graded
mirror giving high resolution and up to 10x increased count rate;
monocapillary giving a 130micron spot size with only 0.3deg
divergence; and a polycapillary which gives "quasi parallel" beam
of 5 to 10mm diameter with again low axial divergence (useful for
stress and texture). A full suite of 32bit software wh
ich
includes texture software capable of Orientational Distribution
Function (ODF), inverse pole figures and real 3D plots is
available.</p>

<p><strong>Graham Fraser</strong> of Bede Scientific Instruments
Ltd. next detailed a revolutionary X-ray source. Using
electromagnetic focusing of the electron beam in the tube
together with a close coupled specularily reflecting mirror, spot
sizes from 25 to 8micron are achievable, but with an X-ray
brightness equivalent to 5kW rotating anode generators, a
lbeit
with less than 50W input power! Although the stated aim is to
provide a source suitable for protein crystallography, its
application to diffraction problems in general seems certain.
Examples of phase gradient contrast radiography were presented,
with comments on the wide potential that this technique offered
in non destructive analysis of a wide range of samples.</p>

<p><strong>Marc Wisemann</strong> of Stoe &amp; Cie. next
detailed the STADI MP goniometer, where considerable thought has
l
ed to a unique system where three geometries are obtained on one
optical bench. A monochromator remains attached to the tube,
giving a beam profile which initially converges to a point focus
and the diverges. By choosing sampling positions in the three
zones, transmission data of high resolution can be obtained
(convergent beam area); texture and residual stress are effected
at the point focus; Bragg Brentano geometry is achievable if the
divergent beam area. Thus, by simply moving to one of three
p
re-set positions, a wide range of experiments may be effected on
one goniometer, with no re-alignment required.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Renshaw</strong> of Oxford Cryosystems finished
this session with a demonstration of the utility and flexibility
of the <em>crystallographica</em> software package which runs on
a PC.</p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL GROUP MEETING REPORT</h1>

<h2>Workshop on Diffraction at Elevated Temperatures.</h2>

<h
2>I.C.I. Technology, Wilton, 3rd June 1998.</h2>

<p>The day began with a tour of the laboratories at Wilton
followed by a formal welcome from Steve Fletcher. Dave Taylor and
Steve Norval continued the days events with a Round Table
Discussion covering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instrumentation</li>

<li>Temperature control and calibration</li>

<li>Calibration of the goniometer</li>

<li>Data quality</li>

<li>Gaseous environments etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>David Taylor gave an account on the progress of H
igh
Temperature Diffraction over the last 30+ years at Pilkington
Glass, Lathom. The first instrument used there was a Rikagu Denki
obtained in 1963 - the latest being a GTP Chamber (1990). The
factors influencing the development of the technique such as -
more powerful x-ray sources, solid state electronics, computer
automation, detectors and x-ray optics were described. Such
developments have enabled in-situ studies of dynamic processes to
be made such as reactions, phase transitions and grain gro
wth.
Such reaction studies at Pilkington involve devitrification
processes and following the phase transitions of quartz through
to crystobalite and tridymite. David pointed out that care must
be taken when studying reactive species as the associated
enthalpy can lead to very large changes in the temperature of the
specimen. A number of other complementary techniques are employed
such as DSC, TGA, TMA, MS (EGA) and optical which identify
temperatures where changes occur without necessarily identifyi
ng
the phase. Tips were given on how to maximise intensity and gain
optimal resolution by slit choice. Time was spent on discussing
the furnace requirements and some special features where
corrosive atmospheres and high pressures are involved as well as
the different methods of heating and controlling the furnace
temperature and temperature calibration. A list of useful
materials for temperature calibration purposes was provided.</p>

transformation of b to g sul
fanilamide as a model process. This
transformation takes place at 132&deg;C in under 4 minutes.
Consequently a rapid means of collecting data is necessary.<br>
</p>

applications. Mark Farnworth of Pilkington Technology described
in detail a number of features outlined earlier by David Taylor
placing particular emphasis on the design and operation of heater
control equipment whilst Ian Rigby of Zeneca Specialties
described the 'screening' 
process employing several techniques at

<h1>Workshop on Residual Stress Measurement by X-ray Metho
ds</h1>

<h2>The Open University, Milton Keynes,24th September 1998</h2>

<p>Twenty-seven people attended the meeting held under the
Auspices of the Industrial Group of the British Crystallographic
Association. The delegates were welcomed by Dr. Mike Fitzpatrick
who explained the structure of the Open University and the
importance of residual stress measurements within his Materials
Department.</p>

<p>Kath Clay of Hexmat Materials Consultancy gave the first
presentation. This was a concise and 
clear explanation of the
technique and its limitations. She stressed that it is a surface
technique and that depth profiling meant removal of material,
which may in itself modify any residual stress in the underlying
matrix. The difference between Elastic and Plastic strain was
also clearly explained.</p>

<p>The next presentation was given by Colin Small of Rolls-Royce.
He encouraged users of the technique to explore the use of
different radiations and (hkl) reflections to get as high a
2<font fa
ce="Symbol">q</font> angle of diffraction as possible.
This could reward the user with better quality data, accuracy and
respectability. He than gave examples of analysis of some vital
components in Rolls-Royce Aeroengines.</p>

<p>Phil Holdway, DERA, Farnborough, then outlined the various
techniques for pinpointing the peak positions. This provoked a
lively discussion which involved K<font face="Symbol">a</font>
<sub>2</sub> peak stripping, peak profile fitting, use of peak
centroid, use of peak t
ip only, cross correlation technique,
number of counting positions over a peak, etc. Delegate
participation cunningly led by the presenter made this a very
informative session.</p>

<p>Colin Small then gave a presentation based around material
removal and corrections, and best practice. This was to have been
presented by Neil Fox of Rolls-Royce who could not be present
because his wife decided it would be a good day to give birth to
a bouncing 9lb 10oz baby boy - Congratulations to Neil and his
wi
fe.</p>

<p>Finally Brian Shore of Newcastle University demonstrated how
residual stress measurements could be performed on difficult
samples like gear wheels. However if Brian's ingenious sample
presentation failed it became necessary to cut up the sample. How
to do this without altering the original stresses in the gear
provoked a final flurry of suggestions and ideas.</p>

<p>The meeting was closed by Kath Clay who thanked those who had
contributed to the successful meeting. The Industrial Grou
p would
like to thank Kent Engineering and Stresstech for subsidising the
Meeting.</p>

<h2>Autumn Meeting of the Industrial Group</h2>

<h3>4 November 1998, Zeneca Specialities, Runcorn,
Manchester</h3>

<p>The meeting was opened by Dr Steve Norval, chairman of the
Industrial Group, and we then watched a site safety video. Dr
Graham McPherson, our host and local organiser, gave an
introduction to Zeneca which is often 
considered as purely a
pharmaceutical company. However, it is best considered as a life
science company as in addition to the pharmaceuticals, there are
two other main businesses: agrochemicals and specialities. The
latter includes various food companies, bioscience and life
science, resins and industrial colour (inkjet colours).</p>

<p>DARTS (Daresbury Analytical Research and Technology Service)
was set up to make it easier for industrialists to obtain access
to the synchrotron source at Daresbur
y. <strong>Dr Chris Frampton
(Roche)</strong> outlined two excellent examples of the
application of Darts to pharmaceutical problem solving. In the
first instance Roche had a 64 atom structure (33 non H atoms)
from which they could only obtain powder data but really wanted
to know the connectivity. Chris indexed the data and guessed a
space group using in-house powder data. Two data sets were then
obtained on station 9.1: the first was used to confirm the space
group and the second one (collected wi
th increasing dwell times
at higher angles) was used for structure determination. The
structure was solved by Prof Bill David and Dr Ken Shanklin using
a simulated annealing approach. This is currently the largest
structure solved from powder data and the information has been
used in a patent. Chris's second example was solving structures
from single crystals that were too small (in one dimension) to
give useable in-house data. The material of
interest,C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>35</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>
5</sub>S<sub>
1</sub>, gave 9 solid forms two of which were solved, for
regulatory purposes, using data obtained by DARTS.</p>

<p>Having had such a positive introduction the benefits of
radiation synchrotron, <strong>Professor Bob Cernick</strong>
assured us that the situation should improve and not deteriorate.
The synchrotron source at Daresbury was the first such facility
and is now showing signs of age. However, updates are planned
over the next few years and when the new facility, Diamond, is

ready these new stations will be placed on it. Both the
government and Welcome Trust have agreed to provide funding and
the new synchrotron source should be built in about 2004 or 2005
at a site still to be agreed.</p>

<p>Returning to pharmaceutical matters, <strong>Elaine Smith
(Heriot Watt University)</strong> talked about her modelling work
which seeks to predict polymorphs. Experimental evidence suggests
that both phenazine and perylene have at least two polymeric
forms but in each case only
 one structure has been well
determined. Using the reported cells for both solved and unsolved
structures she searched for potential packing arrangements and
then ranked them using calculated energies. The work postulates
two structures for which there is currently no reliable
experimental determination.</p>

<p>In the 1998 release, the ICCD (International Centre for
Diffraction Data) powder diffraction data base will grow by a
step jump; 40000 additional patterns of which 8000 are new
entries. Th
ese have been calculated from the structural data in
ICSD (Inorganic Chemistry Structural Database) and it is
anticipated that ICCD will soon do the same for organic
structures. The data have now grown so large that it is hard to
bind books that contain all the entries. Thus ICDD are bringing
out new software, PCSIWIN, which can be used to provide the
functionality of the Hanawalt and Fink search manuals. PCPDFWIN
software has also been upgraded and the new CD-ROM data needs the
new search software.
 <strong>David Taylor</strong> demonstrated
both these products. The only negative response was
disappointment that it appears one must type the d/I file into
PCSIWIN and cannot just copy and paste it in.</p>

<p>After lunch <strong>David Taylor</strong> kept us awake by
wearing an American cap and telling us about the delights of
Denver. Most of us have only glanced though the reports in
Advances in X-ray Analysis (now available on a searchable
CD-ROM). The event is a very large conference coverin
g both XRD
and XRF with many sessions running in parallel. In addition there
are several workshops and teaching sessions.</p>

<p>Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) is becoming
established as a technique that provides texture information
which is often complementary to that provided by classic X-ray
diffraction techniques. Being a scanning technique, information
on grain size and misorientation can be obtained as well as a
full pole figure or ODF. <strong>Dr Ian Brough (Manchester
Materials
 Science Centre, UMIST)</strong> outlined the
principles, advantages and limitations of the technique. As a
metallurgist, he gave examples of its use to investigate texture
in 3%SiFe for transformers and Al for cans where electrical and
mechanical properties are influenced by texture. He also
mentioned that in studying non-conducting samples difficulties
can arise and sometimes these can be solved by a thin coating of

<p>When glancing at glossy magazines one does not immediately
think that
 the paper is covered in kaolinite. <strong>Dr Nick
Elton (English China Clays)</strong> gave us a glimpse of the
many factors that have to be considered when coating relatively
rough paper to give a glossy finish and a good printability.
X-ray data (peak ratios, rocking curves and/or pole figures) are
used to quantify the in-plane alignment of the kaolinite and this
correlates with an industrial measure of gloss. He showed how
X-ray data have been used to help optimise conditions for
calendering by
 investigating the effect of changing the
temperature, pressure and number of cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Jim Chisholm (Health and Safety
Laboratory)</strong> described some of the work that has been
going on as part of the revision of the Method for Determination
of Hazardous Substances for crystalline silica. The health hazard
arises from quartz particles below a certain size and is measured
by collecting airborne particles on filter paper in a small
personal dosemeter. It has been known for over 
40 years that
quartz particles have a surface layer of amorphous material. The
smaller particles have a larger proportion of amorphous material
and hence a lower diffracted intensity (and the largest particles
may give an intensity that is too low because of extinction). The
general view is that size distribution does matter and as far as
possible the standard should be a good match to samples. However,
both the UK and US regulations require determination of
crystalline silica and so long as areas a
re used for
quantification the size might not be important. Recent work has
shown that the relationship between the US and UK standards
depends on the method of comparison; in particular size
distribution depends on flow rate. This re-emphasises the
importance of matching samples and standards and having as much
information as possible about standards.</p>

<p>About 35 people attended this meeting. Graham McPherson and
Philip Lake did a good job of organising an interesting meeting,
which covered 
a wide variety of topics.</p>
