<p>This meeting was organised by <strong>Richard Morris</strong>
(Morris Analytical X-ray), <strong>Dave Taylor</strong> (ICDD)
and <strong>Jeremy Cockcroft</strong> (UCL) and hosted by the ILL
and ESRF on the joint site at Grenoble. Arriving in Grenoble, the
first impression is of how stunningly beautiful the scenery is.
Lying in a valley, surrounded by the Alps, this would certainly
be a pleasant setting to live and work. On to the site itself and
after the briefest of stops at security we settled into our en
suite rooms at the guesthouse.</p>

<br>
Delegates were first treated to a tour of the ILL facility, by
<strong>Charles Dewhurst</strong> and <strong>Isabelle
Grillo</strong> (both ILL). As the reactor was undergoing
maintenance, and no experiments were currently running, this was
an excellent opportunity to get a close look at the experimental
stations. Entrance to the reactor shell is through an enormous
airlock, as the interior of the reactor is held at less than
atmospheric pressure. Once inside, one is struck by the sheer
size of the equipment and engineering and in the very centre,
safely shielded behind concrete and lots of heavy water, was the
reactor core pumping out neutrons. We were also afforded a rare
sight; some of the waveguides carrying neutrons to the
experimental halls were exposed as the concrete shielding had
been removed to install a new guide. Back out through the
airlock, accompanied by the peculiar sensation of
re-pressurisation. After a quick check, to see if any of us had
become contaminated by a small speck of radioactive material (we
were all ok), it was off to the experimental halls at the other
end of those neutron waveguides. Again the scale of the place is
astounding. The scientists and engineers working around and about
had an unhurried manner, for them this was just another day at
work. As my first visit to such a facility, I thought it was all
fascinating, and really quite exciting.

<p>After coffee, we got down to the real business of the day.
<strong>Peter Laggner</strong> (Institute of Biophysics and
Nanosystems Research, Graz) gave a broad overview of the
techniques of SAXS and SANS, starting with the basic theory of
scattering. A brief history of the development of these
techniques led into a discussion of systems suitable for
SAXS/SANS analysis and the "4 limiting cases" for the treatment
of data from such studies. Improvements in laboratory based SAXS
equipment were presented and the point made that many studies
could now be conducted, more conveniently, in the laboratory
without having to travel to a central facility such as the
ESRF.</p>
<p>This was followed by <strong>Fran&ccedil;oise
Ehrburger-Dolle</strong> (Laboratoire de Spectrom&eacute;trie
Physique, CNRS-UJF) who described smectic ordering in side-chain
liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) and in LCP-silica nanocomposites.
She described the types of polymers that can form liquid crystals
and the phenomenon of inter-digitation. A series of SAXS
experiments at different temperatures showed clear changes in the
crystal layer spacings at specific temperatures. This was
attributed to a change in the degree of inter-digitation within
the system. Results from further studies, in which the LCP's were
confined within a silica xerogel, suggested that this change was
inhibited for LCP's residing in the smaller pores where they may
not have the space to rearrange.</p>
<p><strong>Richard G&ouml;rgl</strong> (Materials Centre, Leoben)
presented the NanoSTAR system from Bruker, a laboratory solution
for SAXS studies. Recent improvements to this system were
reported, including a new microfocus X-ray source and a
radiation-hard detector that requires no beam-stop. A study of
crack propagation in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films, using
this system, was presented and a comparison made with similar
data collected using a synchrotron source.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>An excellent lunch was followed by a presentation by
<strong>Charles Dewhurst</strong> (ILL) on D33 - a third
Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument to be installed
at ILL. The new instrument will be capable of experiments in high
magnetic field strengths, something previously impossible at its
predecessor D22 due to that instrument's proximity to extremely
sensitive spin-echo experiments. Combined with a neutron
polariser, D33 will be a superb instrument for the study of
magnetic materials and superconductivity phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Adrian R. Rennie</strong> (Uppsala) presented results
of in-situ studies of flowing samples with SAXS and SANS. The
example given was surfactant templated synthesis of mesoporous
silica. Contrast matching techniques were used to remove the
effects of silica from the scattering data and reveal the
structure of surfactant micelles present in the system. It was
shown that, while the micelles have a strong influence, there is
a densification step late in the crystallisation process that
determines the final structure. Further experiments showed that
the addition of salts to the synthesis could affect the
structures obtained by modifying the surfactant micelles.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto Saiani</strong> (Manchester) then talked about
creating 3D-networks and hydrogels from self-assembling peptides.
This study was based on synthetic octa-peptides, which were
designed to self-assemble into rod-like structures solution.
Changing the octa-peptide was shown to alter its self-assembly
behaviour in solution, longer or shorter rods could be obtained.
Hydrogels formed by these differing systems had markedly
different morphologies. The longer rods gelled by simply
entangling like spaghetti, while the shorter rods formed a true
3-dimensional network with branching points.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Alexis Deschamps</strong> (SIMAP, France) summarised
some of the recent progress made in characterising precipitates
in metallic alloys using small-angle scattering. The
microstructure of these precipitates has a strong influence on
the mechanical behaviour of the metal. This was illustrated with
a study of Aluminium-Zirconium-Scandium alloys, in which
precipitates of ZrSc are found, with a Scandium rich core
surrounded by a shell that is relatively rich in Zirconium. SAXS
was used to characterise these precipitates in terms of their
size, composition and thickness of the shell.</p>
<p>This was followed by <strong>Andrew Harrison</strong> (ILL)
who discussed applications of microwaves in materials science.
The ability of microwaves to selectively heat one component of a
system was presented. This effect could be utilised for
"quick-start" catalytic converters in which the catalytic metal
particles are rapidly raised to their operating temperature,
increasing the efficiency of the converter. The effects of
microwaves on biological materials were also discussed. It was
shown that microwaves, at wavelength used by mobile phones, had a
small heating effect on phospholipids (which form cell membranes
within the body). Is this bad news for the telecommunications
industry? Probably not, the size of the effect is too small and
mobile phones simply don't emit enough microwaves.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Hiller</strong> (Diamond Light Source Ltd)
followed this with details of I22, the new beamline at Diamond.
Specifically designed for work on non-crystalline systems, I22 is
now ready to receive its first users and Jennifer extended an
invitation to all for applications for beam-time. This came with
the caveat that Diamond is still a very new facility and that
early users should expect some teething problems.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Laity</strong> (Cambridge) ended the day with
details of recent work using SAXS to investigate the deformation
of polymeric powders undergoing compaction. Understanding this
process is of particular importance to the pharmaceutical
industry for the making of pills. The use of SAXS to study powder
compaction has not previously been reported in the literature.
After a discussion of possible mechanisms for the compaction of
powders when loads are applied, Peter demonstrated that powder
compaction can be understood in terms of the packing of the
particles at low pressures, followed by so-called affine
deformations in which the particles change shape to give greater
interfacial contact and hence better bonding between neighbouring
particles.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The evening provided an opportunity for socialising with the
conference dinner. A short coach ride into town brought us to "La
Panse" where we were able to enjoy some of the cuisine for which
the region is justifiably famous. This was accompanied by plenty
of good red wine, a most welcome and enjoyable end to the first
day.</p>
<h5>Day 2 - 3rd July</h5>
<p>The second day was kicked off by <strong>Jean-Paul
Simon</strong> (SIMPAP) who spoke about ultra low k dielectrics
for microelectronics. In order to reduce "cross-talk" between the
copper tracks on integrated circuit boards, nanoporous materials
have been developed to make use of the very low dielectric
constant of air. Jean-Paul spoke about how the pores in these
materials are produced and the use of grazing incidence SAXS
(GISAXS) to characterise them.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Riekel</strong> (ESRF) followed this with an
introduction to small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS/WAXS) using micron- and submicron-sized synchrotron
radiation beams. The small size of these beams allows scanning of
a sample to build up a composite "image". This was demonstrated
with a study of starch grains showing the internal morphologies.
The high flux of synchrotron radiation allows for time resolved
studies, once again demonstrated with starch, this time
determining the kinetics of starch hydration. One of the stranger
applications of this technique was a study of spider silk, drawn
directly from the spider's spinnerets. We were assured the spider
did not mind being strapped to a table, inches from a synchrotron
x-ray beam.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>Tim Wess</strong> (Cardiff) discussed structural
hierarchies in biological molecules. The properties of biological
materials depend strongly on the arrangement and interactions of
the molecules that comprise them. Using the example of fibrillin,
an elastic component of connective tissues, Tim showed how the
arrangement of the molecules could be elucidated from SAXS data
and how this related to the mechanical properties of the
tissue.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Vladimir Kogan</strong> (DANNALAB &amp; PANalytical
BV, The Netherlands) presented the results of SAXS evaluation on
nanoparticles, polymers and biological macromolecules conducted
on the conventional X'Pert MRD diffractometer equipped with
dedicated collimation system, optics and source.</p>
<p><strong>Wim Bras</strong> (ESRF) then gave an entertaining
talk titled "The Joy of SAXS and other toys". Using the example
of crystallization in glass ceramics, Wim demonstrated the
enormous benefit of combining SAXS data with that garnered from
other techniques when elucidating structures and determining
kinetics. Ideas that are suggested by one set of data can be
confirmed or rejected based on other results.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Richard Morris</strong> (Morris Analytical
X-ray) gave an overview of the history of Morris Analytical X-ray
and shared some his knowledge of surfactant meso-phases.</p>

<br>
<p>To close the meeting, Dave Taylor, thanked all speakers and
delegates for making the BCA's first foray onto foreign soil such
a success. Thanks were also given to the meeting's sponsors,
without whom we would all have gone hungry on Monday night.</p>
<p>After the meeting proper, there was an optional tour of the
ESRF located just next door to the ILL. Having heard so many
talks about synchrotron SAXS experiments, I was keen to see the
sort of kit used to perform them. Inside the synchrotron
building, there is the same sense of massive complexity as at the
ILL but a much more enclosed feeling due to the curvature of the
ring. Wim Bras once again demonstrated his enormous enthusiasm
for his work whilst describing the features of his own beamline
(DUBBLE).</p>

<h5><i>A French bursary students impression on BCA's meeting on
small-angle scattering</i></h5>
<p>    <i> Everything started at the gate of the joint site of ESRF
and ILL in Grenoble. After the control check point, delegates
were to meet on the main building of ILL site, in order to
receive a few security advises and to start the meeting by a tour
of the facility. A few minutes later, they were separated in two
groups leaded by the two heads of line D22, I. Grillo and C.
Dewhurst. Just a few seconds to talk with delegates and we were
entering the airlock between the main building and the reactor.
Heart bumping, air pumping and that's it we're in! Just behind
these heavy concrete walls, uranium is producing high energy
neutrons directed to more than 20 lines running through 50 meters
long for some of them. All around is crowded with huge
instruments, spectrometers, monochromators, lines being
constructed&hellip;<br>
     Before we even knew it, the tour of the experimental hall
was finished, back to the airlock, and contamination
check&hellip;3, 2, 1, all right no neutrons on my body let's go
to the neutrons guide halls. Both these guide halls are amazingly
huge, around 100 meters long for each and are housing lines
dedicated to SANS and WANS, diffraction, reflectometry,
spectrometry all of these accessible to researchers from all
around the world (be prepared to wait a few months though). The
tour finished it's time for a coffee break and to start working,
but before take the time to notice the amazing mountains
surrounding the joint site.</i></p>
<p>     <i>After an exhaustive introduction about SAXS and SANS by
Prof. Laggner, researchers presented the various applications of
the X-rays or neutrons scattering. Coming from a material
speciality, I was only aware of a few of them but one would be
really surprised witnessing all the possibilities of scattering
on the study of soft and hard matter. Of course, you can estimate
the size and the volume fraction of a given population inside
your sample whether it be a metal, a powder, a polymer liquid or
not, or a living tissue such as spider web! But you can also get
some information about ordering in your system, do some in-situ
experiments on flowing fluids or on living tissues such as cornea
muscle fibres, identify the interacting groups of a polymer chain
and even model the effect of microwaves generated by cell phones
on the proteins of our brains. Finally one would discover less
known techniques such as GISAXS used to study thin layers and
EXAFS.<br>
     Added to that, the partners of the meeting presented us with
some of their products for small and wide angle scattering to be
used in the lab and overall, the details of the project of a
construction of an additional small angle beam line at ILL, the
D33 line, and the different steps of the mise-en-route of the
beam for a new small angle line at Diamond (UK) were given.
Finally a tour of several lines of the ESRF was also proposed at
the end of the meeting.</i></p>
<p>     <i>Delegates were also given the occasion to discover French
cooking and wines at the conference dinner whom organisation was
courtesy of the meeting sponsors. This very informal meeting was
a real success, with some really good presentations, and
excellent reception and organisation from the joint site. I can
only invite you to keep informed on the next meeting of BCA's on
small-angle scattering or at least to take one of the annual
tours organized by the joint site to discover the joys of small
angle scattering.</i></p>
