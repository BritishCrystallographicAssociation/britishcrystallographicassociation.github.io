<h1><a name="Chair04">Chairman's Report for 2004</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2005 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>April 2005, University of Loughborough.</b></p>
<p>This is my first report as chairman of the Industrial Group.
For many of us, it has been a time of change. Personally, as some
of you will know, Paul Barnes, myself, and others in the
Industrial Materials Group in Crystallography at Birkbeck
relocated last Autumn to new facilities in Chemistry at UCL. It
was a sad day in the sense that it brought an end to the vision
of the founder of the Departmental of Crystallography, J. D.
Bernal. Bernal was a man of great vision, who, despite his
background in physics, encouraged the creation of research into,
what was at that time, novel areas of crystallography such as
biological structure determination, liquid and amorphous
diffraction, and the investigation of industrial materials such
as cements. I realise that Paul Barnes and myself have been very
fortunate.</p>
<p>As I wrote for the recent Industrial Group Newsletter, many of
you this year have not been so lucky. The decline of
diffraction-based research still seems to continue in many
industries with the loss of many skills. I have seen this at
close quarters this year with 3 of the committee members facing
possible (and in at least 1 case now notice of) redundancy due to
closure of industrial research laboratories. It was such losses
from industry that led the membership last year to question the
constitution of the Industrial Group committee. As chairman, I
have acted upon this and, with the agreement of the committee,
have proposed the changes published in Crystallography News. We
will discuss this issue later in the AGM.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult circumstances, the Industrial Group of
the BCA still has a very active committee who meet on a regular
basis, typically 3 times per year, in contrast to some of the
other BCA groups. We have been fortunate to have had the use of
facilities at Huntsman Surface Sciences at Oldbury, near
Birmingham for our committee meetings and I would like to express
my personal thanks to Richard Morris for arranging these
facilities. The main activity of the committee is to organise
meetings and workshops of interest to the members, and this last
year has been no exception.</p>
<p>Last summer, we organised an "Introduction to Powder
Diffraction" workshop, which was held at UMIST and organised by
our group secretary-treasurer Judith Shackleton. I thank her for
all the hard work involved. These workshops form part of our
remit as an educational charitable organisation. Ideas for
workshop themes from the core membership are always welcome. We
do listen to your feedback: so it was feedback from the summer
workshop that has directly resulted in the theme chosen for our
next one this autumn on the theme of "Patents in
Crystallography". This theme is so important for many of you that
we have decided to include it as part of our annual autumn
meeting. Consequently, the two events will be held back-to-back
and it will be possible to register for either event or both. In
addition, the afternoon session of the autumn meeting this year
will continue our regular theme of "Crystallography in
Industry".</p>
<p>Last autumn, we had two meetings: the first held at Alderley
Park and sponsored by Astra Zenecca related to our Pharmaceutical
Special Interest Group. The meeting was well attended and I would
like to thank Anne Kavanagh and all those who helped organise it.
Personally, I found it very enjoyable as my only contribution was
to simply turn up and be a member of the audience for a change.
The second autumn meeting was on the slightly eclectic topic of
"DIY Crystallography". We had many contrasting talks at both ends
of the spectrum for both hardware and software and I would like
to thank all of those who took part in this enjoyable event,
which was held again at Birkbeck College. I also have to thank
the School of Crystallography for sponsoring such events by the
provision of facilities. Some of you may wonder why we use
Birkbeck College for holding so many meetings. The answer is that
the College is still one of the few academic institutions that
offers cheap (as opposed to commercial) rates for academic
meetings in contrast to most UK academic institutions. However,
we are keen to use industrial venues too, so suggestions and,
better still offers, from members located in UK industry are
always welcome.</p>
<p>The Industrial Group newsletter continues to be produced twice
a year by our vice-chair, Phil Holdway, with help from Dave
Taylor, and I thank them for their work. We are always on the
lookout for interesting articles, so please don't hold back if
you feel you have something interesting to say. Photos are also
welcome. We are also very grateful to the various sponsors of the
newsletter. Since the last AGM, our newsletter has been sponsored
by PANalytical and Hiltonbrooks, the latter as a 25th anniversary
celebration.</p>
<p>New to the BCA Spring Meeting this year are the XRF sessions.
There is appreciable overlap between XRF and XRD in terms of the
manufacturers and many users of XRD also use XRF. We will discuss
later in the AGM whether the Industrial Group of the BCA should
consider encompassing both the XRD and XRF communities.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank our secretary and treasurer, Judith
Shackleton, for all her hard work. It is not an easy job, and I
know that most of the work has to be done in her own free time at
home. Please try to make her job easier by paying for Industrial
Group meetings in a timely manner - following up non-payers is a
time consuming exercise.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to thanking all of the committee for
their support during the year, I would like to pay a special
thank you to Dave Taylor. Not only has he been BCA Treasurer for
5 years, but he is also the Industrial Group webmaster. As such
he continues to work hard behind the scenes in maintaining the
web pages of the Industrial Group. They are clearly the best web
pages of all of the 4 groups of the BCA and I'm sure his efforts
in this area are well appreciated by all.</p>
<p>This ends the Chairman's report for the year 2004.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair03">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 2003</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2004 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>April 2004, UMIST, Manchester</b></p>
<p>Prof. Chris Frampton reported :<br>
</p>
<p>This is my final report as the chairman of the industrial
group and looking back over the chair reports of the past three
years there appears to be an underlying theme in which I say that
every year there appears to be fewer and fewer true industrial
crystallographers. When I took on the position as chair three
years ago I thought at that time that my position with Roche
Discovery was a secure one. In fact within 4 weeks of the Reading
meeting it was announced that our site would be closing in 3
months. The period of my chairmanship has seen many mergers and
acquisitions in the industries within which we work and this
trend does not seem to show any signs of slowing up. However on a
positive note I have noticed the appearance of many smaller
companies offering contract analysis services and from these a
new breed of industrial crystallographer is now emerging. During
the past year I have changed my position. "Moving over to the
dark side" as one eminent colleague put it. This has brought
challenges of a different sort to my role within the Industrial
Group. Our meeting program for 2003 consisted of the annual
Spring meeting held at the University of York and the two day
"Forum II" meeting held at Birkbeck College, in November.</p>
<p>The Spring meeting in York consisted of sessions based on
Phase Identification and Quantitative Analysis. The quantitative
analysis session also reported on the results from a round robin
study. Two samples were available for study an "Inorganic" and an
"Organic pharmaceutical type" The round robin attracted a lot of
interest and in all we had about 10 laboratories taking part. The
results returned were all very impressive which demonstrates the
high quality science that we do. I would like to thank Jeremy
Cockcroft for taking on the lion's share of the work in
organising this round robin, from preparing the samples, sending
them out and collating the results. He even found time to do the
experiment himself. I would also like to thank the other members
of the committee for the organisation of the other sessions in
the meeting.</p>
<p>The Autumn meeting departed from the tried and tested format
of a "Crystallography in Industry" meeting to a two day Forum II
meeting at Birkbeck college. This meeting consisted of two joint
sessions and two parallel sessions. It was a pleasure to see
Colin Small presented with an Industrial Group Award and he gave
an entertaining lecture entitled "Adventures in Crystallography
in the Gas turbine industry". Overall I have received many
positive comments on the Forum and I believe that this format of
meeting is a welcome change to the usual one day meetings.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2004, we have planned some further SIG
meetings. The dates for these meeting are on the website and the
program content will be filled in shortly. Please keep visiting
the website for updates on these.</p>
<p>Finally we are about to have a change in the committee this
year and I would like to thank all the members of the committee
for their support over the past three years. Serving the
Industrial Group as chairman has been very pleasurable and
rewarding experience.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair02">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 2002</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2003 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>April 2003, University of York</b></p>
<p>Prof. Chris Frampton reported :<br>
</p>
<p>Every year there appears to be fewer and fewer true industrial
crystallographers. It seems as if current working practices and
management ideas in industry do not allow for the apparent luxury
of an in-house diffraction laboratory. The current fashion is
that a good deal of this work is currently being contracted out
to University departments and specialist contract analytical
companies. This year has been fairly light on meetings reflecting
on the feeling that it is becoming harder and harder to justify
the time away from the bench. Our meeting program consisted of
the annual Spring meeting held at the University of Nottingham
and the Autumn meeting held at Hulme Hall, Manchester.</p>
<p>The Spring meeting in Nottingham consisted of three workshop
sessions based around the following topics, thin films, an
introduction to amorphous materials and a powder diffraction
surgery. From the comments I have received from members of the
group these were all deemed to be excellent sessions and very
useful. I would like to thank all of the people responsible for
organizing these sessions in particular, Paul Fewster, Judith
Shackleton, Jeremy Cockcroft and Dave Taylor.</p>
<p>The Autumn meeting kept again to the tried and tested format
of a "Crystallography in Industry" meeting organized and hosted
by Judith Shackleton at Hulme Hall in Manchester. This was a
super venue for the meeting and the science was also first rate.
For me the highlight of this meeting was the great pleasure at
presenting Jo Jutson with an Industrial Group Award for her work
on micro-diffraction and her great support of the Industrial
group over past years. Her paper "From Spinel Analysis to Micro
X-ray Diffraction - a Personal View of Applications and Advances"
was an excellent overview of the progress in X-ray diffraction
and instrumentation over the span of her career. Jo chose a
Beevers model of a Spinel phase for her award.</p>
<p>On a more depressing note we were all saddened to hear of the
death of Ron Jenkins in June 2002. Ron was a larger than life
character and an outstanding teacher. My first encounter with Ron
Personally was fairly recent at the BCA Meeting in Leeds. I was
fortunate enough to be the recipient of the IG poster prize that
year which was a personally signed copy of his book. This is
something I will certainly treasure for years to come.</p>
<p>A recent survey was conducted regarding the topics for future
Industrial Group meetings and I would like to thank all those who
sent in replies and to Brett Cooper for collating the results. We
have tried to reflect the wishes of the group when putting the
program together for this years Spring meeting on the basis of
this survey with Polycrystalline materials, Phase ID, and QA
being the major subjects this year.</p>
<p>Our next meeting is going to be in the Autumn and will
hopefully be held over two days having a similar format to the
successful IG Forum held in 1999. Program and dates will be
available shortly.</p>
<p>Finally we are about to have a change in the committee this
year and I would like to thank Phil Holdway for his sterling
efforts as Secretary/Treasurer.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank departing committee members Clare
Anderton and Paul Fewster for all their hard work. Working with
all of the people on the committee is a great pleasure and I hope
the new members enjoy the experience</p>

<h1><a name="Chair01">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 2001</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2002 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>March 2002, University of Nottingham</b></p>
<p>Prof. Chris Frampton reported :<br>
This is the first report of my three-year occupation of the
Industrial Group chair and I have to admit that this period for
me has been challenging in the extreme. I was unable to attend
the BCA spring meeting at Reading owing to the birth of my third
daughter, Phoebe. One can never plan these events to any great
precision and unfortunately this meant that I missed the AGM in
2001 and also the official hand over of the chair from Steve
Norval. Since it was not possible for me to be there and thank
Steve personally I would like to place on record here a big thank
you to Steve for all his efforts on behalf of the group over the
past three years. From my previous position as
secretary/treasurer and as vice-chair he has been a very great
pleasure to work with and an excellent chairman for the group. As
a consequence this means that I have a very hard act to
follow.</p>
<p>Not being present at Reading makes it very difficult for me to
comment on the IG sessions held at that meeting. From reading the
meeting reports and talking to the participants it was clear that
the organized sessions were very rewarding. The IG group held
three principal sessions, a &ldquo;Basic Powder Diffraction
Workshop&rdquo; which was an educational session aimed at aimed
at people relatively new to the field of powder diffraction, a
session on &ldquo;Why Industry uses Crystallography&rdquo; giving
an overview of the value crystallography brings to industry and
finally last but by no means least &ldquo;New and Future
Possibilities in Powder X-ray Diffraction&rdquo;, a session aimed
at wetting our appetites for the diffractometer and software of
the future.</p>
<p>The next meeting that followed in 2001 was a Pharmaceutical
SIG hosted by Clare Anderton at GlaxoSmithKline. This meeting was
based around a loose theme of High Throughput Powder Diffraction,
a very popular and topical subject and as a consequence the
meeting was very well attended. On a lighter note, I now know
where the expression &ldquo;no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo;
comes from. The final meeting of the year returned to the tried
and tested format of a &ldquo;Crystallography in Industry&rdquo;
meeting organized by Judith Shackleton and hosted by Mark
Farnworth of Pilkington European Technical Centre, Lancashire.
This meeting had the usual broad depth of subject with talks from
diverse sectors of industry. It was also a great pleasure at this
meeting to present Ian Langford with the Industrial Group Award
for his work on profile analysis. Given that he had used Zinc
Oxide as an example in many of his papers it was fitting that Ian
should choose to have a Beevers model of zinc oxide for his
award.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging event of this year for me was
that six-weeks after the Reading spring meeting the untimely and
completely surprising announcement of the closure of Roche
Discovery Welwyn, where I had been employed as a crystallographer
for the previous 9 years. This came as a complete shock to both
me and my colleagues at Roche and is perhaps a sign of the times
that we are living in. Steve Norval comments in his 2001 chair
report that &ldquo;crystallographers working in industry are
becoming an endangered species&rdquo; for me were very prophetic.
It is true that industrial crystallography positions appear to be
shrinking by the year with mergers and closures taking their toll
on our numbers. This is of course continuing to take its toll on
the committee and consequently it is becoming harder and harder
to fill vacant positions.</p>
<p>The IG newsletter and web pages continue to grow and I would
like to thank Phil Holdway, Colin Small and David Taylor for
their efforts in this direction. On a continuing note I would
also like to thank our Industrial sponsors for the newsletter,
Bruker AXS and Phillips Analytical X-ray.<br>
 Finally I would like to finish by thanking all members of the
current committee for their support over the past year. It makes
it all worthwhile working with an excellent group of people on
the committee and knowing that our efforts are well
appreciated.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair00">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 2000</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2001 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>10 April 2000, University of Reading</b></p>
<p>Dr Steve Norval reported :<br>
This is the third and last report of my three-year occupation of
the Industrial Group chair. I won't pretend that it has been an
easy term - the thing that makes it all worthwhile is working
with an excellent group of people on the committee and knowing
that our efforts are appreciated.</p>
<p>2000 saw IG return to a more conventional programme after the
peculiarities of the IUCr congress and the IG Forum in 1999. The
sessions at the Heriot-Watt meeting incorporated the
pharmaceuticals special interest area (organised by Philip Lake)
and controlled environment xrd (organised by Dave Taylor). That
was followed up by a workshop on non-ambient diffraction run by
Dave and Jeremy Cockcroft at Birkbeck College. At the end of the
summer, Judith and Phil put together a residual stress workshop
at UMIST and then Chris Frampton hosted our Autumn Meeting at
Roche Discovery. It was a great pleasure to present one of our
former chairmen, David Dyson, with an Industrial Group Award at
that meeting. There is much that could be said in praise of the
contributions made to these events, but I don't want to
single-out individuals. They all deserve our warmest thanks.</p>
<p>However, I should mention that we have had three events at
Birkbeck in the course of a year. That has been a very useful
<i>pied-a-terre</i> for us in London and we are very grateful to
Jeremy for making it possible.</p>
<p>One of those meetings was our main annual committee meeting
that we combined with a discussion of European Standards for
XRPD. That was very helpful to me in representing UK and BCA on
the European Working Group putting the documents together. That
work is continuing and it should not be too long now before the
first two standard documents appear.</p>
<p>The Group newsletter continues to prosper. Our total
circulation is around 400. That can make it a bit expensive, so
some of the circulation now is electronic. Colin Small has put in
two years as editor and has really helped to make it less of a
list of things past present and future. The web site also gets
better every year. It has been particularly useful lately to have
the best information on meeting programmes appearing there so
quickly. I am sure that some speakers names have been on the web
within an hour or two of agreeing to give a talk.</p>
<p>We have made an excellent start to 2001 with the excellent
presentations already made here. There have been a number of
powder diffraction workshops with different emphases over the
years. This one gave a very balanced account of basic
crystallography, powder diffraction instrumentation and phase
identification. We have also had some fascinating accounts of the
ways in which our techniques are being used by different
industries and some powder diffraction developments to look
forward to over the next few years. Thanks go to all those who
gave up their weekend and particularly those who put together
such excellent presentations.</p>
<p>Later this year, we are to have a one-day pharmaceuticals
meeting in June at GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow. Pilkingtons at
Ormskirk have agreed to host our Autumn meeting (1 November).
Judith Shackleton is putting together a programme for that, so
look out! We also expect to be making another Industrial Group
Award at that meeting. Next year, there is the possibility of
another Industrial Crystallography Forum.</p>
<p>It has become apparent over these last three years that
crystallographers working in industry are becoming an endangered
species, at least in some sectors. Many of the survivors are
really tightly constrained by short-sighted management who are
reluctant to let them participate in BCA and the like. These
meetings, where we can learn or share our science with our peers,
help many people to keep going as scientists (I won't claim that
it helps them keep them sane - pleasantly eccentric is a bit more
like it!). This raises important questions for the future of IG.
It has been getting much more difficult to find real industrial
speakers and even people to come to meetings. The need to have
practitioners trained and informed has not disappeared. Indeed,
there seems to be a much higher turnover of people working in
powder diffraction, too many of them relying on "black-box"
answers because it is too time-consuming and expensive to get
properly trained. I am personally convinced of the value of IG to
British industry, but it will be difficult to maintain it because
of the pressures on individuals, especially committee members. I
would ask you all to give your committee every help and
encouragement to keep it going.</p>
<p>A consequence of the changing industrial world is that we have
had a high turnover of committee members and officers over the
last three years. We have had three vice-chairmen in three years.
Others disappeared before we got around to asking them if they
would do it! I have been asking myself what my responsibility has
been for this. After all, to lose one vice-chairman might be
considered unfortunate; to lose two might be considered careless;
to lose three seems downright negligent. Realistically, this is
the kind of situation that might be expected for the future. The
new committee may have to consider a more practical way forward
than assuming that committee members will be around for three
years or that future chairmen will have served three years on the
committee and another three as vice-chair.</p>
<p>Finally, it just remains to say a very real thank-you to so
many that have served on the committee. Colin Small is leaving us
this year and Philip Lake has kindly stayed with us for an extra
year as a co-opted member. We do thank them both for going more
than the extra mile with us and for all the hard work they have
put in over several years. To all of the committee who have
served this year and over the previous two, I would again say a
heart-felt thank-you. It is you guys that turn something worthy
into something worthwhile and very enjoyable.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair99">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1999</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2000 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p>Dr Steve Norval reported :<br>
In some respects, it doesn&rsquo;t seem so very long since the
last Chairman&rsquo;s report. It was delivered at the Industrial
Crystallography Forum in Coventry and, as a group, we
haven&rsquo;t had our usual year full of Group activities since
then. Most of our 1999 activities were packed into a very
concentrated two days and a total of six sessions, covering
materials science, pharmaceuticals, Rietveld refinement, quality
assurance, industrial applications and thin films. Everyone
seemed to like the format, but the big question is whether or not
we should do it again. The committee would be most interested to
hear from anyone with an opinion. I am not going to list all the
things that were done by so many people to make the Forum such a
success, it really was a team effort. But I would mention with
thanks the huge administrative effort from Jo Jutson and Dave
Taylor. It&rsquo;s only when you are involved in organizing a
residential meeting that you realize what you have taken on. I
should also mention the sponsorship that we received from
Bruker-AXS, ICDD, Microsource-Bede, Oxford Cryosystems and
Philips Analytical. It&rsquo;s not only the money that is given
by these companies, but we do also detect a genuine interest in
our activities and we thank them for their support.</p>
<p>In the course of the Forum, we doubled-up on the Alun Bowen
lecture and an Industrial Group Award that was presented to David
Rendle, who also gave the lecture. It was a great pleasure to
catch up with David again, and it is good to see that he has just
been re-elected as a member of the ICDD board.</p>
<p>For some, 1999 was the year of the IUCr Congress at Glasgow,
which was a great success in many ways. The IG was
well-represented, in quality if not number of delegates. The main
Group input was a poster that displayed a range of uses of
Industrial Crystallography in UK (it is now on the web site).</p>
<p>After the Forum, the committee took some time to decide that
there should be an Autumn meeting. Other crystallography meetings
seemed to have left most of our community exhausted by November.
But a format was found to suit a smaller number of participants
and the meeting was held at Birkbeck College, hosted by Jeremy
Cockcroft. The workshop covered the use of the Internet, software
available on the Internet and Spreadsheets for Crystallography,
with plenty of hands-on time, making the most of the local
facilities. It was well received by those who came and the format
is already influencing plans for at least one workshop this year.
Another spin-off from the meeting was a set of spreadsheets from
the web site and the hope that it will grow as a facility for a
much wider community around the world. Our thanks go to Dave
Taylor for starting something with real potential.</p>
<p>Our other activities continue strongly. The web site continues
to grow and the Newsletter continues to go out twice a year, now
under the editorial control of Colin Small. It's good to see that
Colin has stamped some of his personality on it, with a bit more
human interest to reports, etc. I continue to represent BCA and
UK in the group working towards a European Standard for XRPD. I
took that on 3 years ago thinking it would mean attending two or
three meetings over a couple of years. I don't dare to make
predictions about just when it will be completed, but if anyone
is interested in getting involved, it's certainly not too late.
The good news is that two of the five parts of the standard are
quite close to completion.</p>
<p>Before finishing, I must once again thank the Committee all
for the tremendous effort they have made on our behalf over last
year. In many ways it is a sign of the times for manufacturing
industry that several individuals have had to resign or take a
back seat. Bruce Fox and Graham McPherson have changed jobs. Jo
Jutson retired from work at the end of last year and couldn't
continue as vice-chair. Kath Clay, Mary Vickers and Philip Lake
have all come to the end of their three-year term as committee
members. All of these people have helped far and wide in
organizing specific meetings and in the many other less obvious
things that get done by the committee.</p>
<p>I would like to finish with a special work of thanks to Jo
Jutson. Jo has served on the committee as a member,
secretary/treasurer, and latterly as vice-chairman. She has
always been available to help and given so much to the group. I
am sure we all wish her well in her retirement.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you all for supporting the group activities
over the year. We have a very full programme arranged for this
year and hope we will see you often.</p>
