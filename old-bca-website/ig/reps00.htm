<p align="CENTER"><b>A Breath of Fresh Air - Specimen Preparation
Workshop</b></p>

<p>It was a welcome relief to attend the Industrial Group Meeting
during Tuesday afternoon at the BCA Spring Meeting. I find the
challenge to understand the organic structures and mathematical
methods employed are becoming more comple
x as I get older.
Therefore, the Specimen Preparation Workshop was a welcome change
in which I could relate in the <b>real</b> world. I believe if
all meetings were based on a formal agenda but with some,
controlled, informality where all participants could interrupt
the proceedings and make the subject more interactive.</p>

<p>The meeting was chaired by Steve Norval and started with an
introduction to Jeremy Cockcroft (Birkbeck College). The title
encompassed the <b>A</b> ~ <b>Z</b> of specimen p
reparation which
made attendees aware of the pitfalls associated with varying
samples requiring different approaches. Typical effects occurring
during sample mounting are as follows:-</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Do not use shallow sample holders when preparing organic
samples; especially at high angles 2-theta.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Aware of sample holders may give a structure pattern causing
more confusion.</li>

<li>Flat, solid materials may show preferred orientation.</li>

<li>The lis
t was endless because instrument parameters e.g. slit
sizes, monochromators, scanning rates, x-ray wavelengths may
incur additional errors. Also, sample types may suffer from
atmospheric humidity, temperature phase changes, particle sizes
etc.,<br>
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There was plenty of discussion regarding the use of fillers
for samples that requires additional bulk if the sample did not
meet the requirements of sample holder volume.</p>

<p>Examples that were mentioned are as follows:-</p>


<ol>
<li>Blue-tak has structure and has a life of its own (moves)
during examination.</li>

<li>Plasticine is better because it has 'still-life' but with
some structure.</li>

<li>Wax is the preferred option.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although, apparently if you can get it there is an amorphous
adhesive on 'Scotch' pressure sensitive tape. When rubbed between
the thumb and forefinger it resembles <b>snot</b>. This
four-letter word was delivered with such dexterity from a Rolls
Royce attendee.</p>

<
p>The next presentation was made by Stephen Hillier (Macauley
Institute) who explained the virtues of an up-turned conical
dustbin with a spray-gun held at the apex. This novel and
practical design enabled his co-workers to spray-dry mud samples
(clays) onto paper. This method of sample preparation alleviates
preferred orientation, with no measurable cross contamination and
an output of up to thirty samples per/day. The Institute now
markets this fine example of design ingenuity.</p>

<p>After the 
tea break Steve Norval reported on his Round-Robin
exercise. The results compared various methods of sample
preparation. The methods included front-filled, back-filled with
moderate and light pressure, side filled and iso-propyl alcohol
dispersion. The results concluded that a spray-dried sample gave
the ideal performance and using sample rotation did not effect
peak intensity.</p>

<p>The following talk was done with great dexterity and
imagination because Colin Small had no overheads, images,
sp
readsheets or slides to show the audience. However, he still
managed to captivate the gathering on how we should prepare
metallic specimens for texture analysis.</p>

<p>Finally, Phil Lake (Glaxo Wellcome) was invited to start a
discussion period concerning a sample that generated two
different diffraction patterns. The meeting then became a
'free-for-all' when everybody gave possible explanations and
reasons - why? Could the answer be the position of the x-ray
tube, automatic divergence slits, sam
ple position etc., I believe
Phil did promise an answer by the next I. G. newsletter.</p>

<p>The 'Workshop' format did provide the opportunity for the
attendees to interact and made for a good open discussion. I
believe everybody feels intimidated by different facets of
crystallography beyond their depth of understanding. Therefore,
identify a common ingredient in the real world of I. G.
crystallography and I believe it will propagate
self-interest.</p>

<h1>BCA Spring Meeting</h1>

<h2>Heriot Watt University 5 April 2000</h2>

<h2>Controlled environment XRD</h2>

<p>This final group session of the BCA 2000 spring meeting at
Heriot Watt University rewarded those attending with a number of
excellent presentations on techniques using different diffraction
experiments in various controlled environments. The last but one
timetabled session of the three day event was expertly chaired by
Dave T
aylor to accommodate six 20 minute talks (of which one
delegate remarked "It was good to hear so much pertinent science
being discussed&hellip;.." with reference to the succinct and
witty delivery of the invited speakers).</p>

<p>Simon Redfern (Cambridge University) opened the afternoon with
a description of novel instrumentation designed to collect X-ray
diffraction data from mechanically stressed crystals. Using a
three-point bend arrangement with a 120 degree position sensitive
detector he desc
ribed how it would be possible to study
ferroelastic materials under conditions where the applied stress
is varied. He told the audience that the apparatus was still
under construction and showed slides of the computer generated
design stage of the manufacturing process. The equipment will be
particularly useful in following changes in the elastic shear
modulus as materials undergo phase transitions on heating.</p>

<p>Simon rescheduled his talk so that he could catch a waiting
taxi and was followe
d by John Loveday (Edinburgh) with an
absorbing talk on neutron diffraction at high pressure with
particular emphasis on boron nitride. John informed the audience
of the development of the Paris-Edinburgh cell (low mass, large
volume) which had now extended the pressure range for neutron
diffraction experiments by an order of magnitude up to 30 GPa
(300kbar). He also mentioned the high pressure phase behaviour of
ammonia monohydrate and explained its importance for formation
models of Jupiter's moon
 Titan and other planetary
satellites.</p>

<p>Few of us present will forget without a smile John's last
cartoon of two hungry polar bears astride adjoining holes in the
Arctic ice. One seen smashing its fist into the water beneath one
hole, while the other catches a fish ejected from the other hole
with the caption: IF YOU WANT RESULTS FAST, USE HIGH PRESSURE
!</p>

<p>Following on and also from Edinburgh University, Andrew
Harrison speculated on the claims that the rate or even the
course of a
 reaction may be influenced by microwave heating
effects. Although using microwaves has become a routine reaction
method in preparative chemistry "the jury is still out". Andrew
produced some outstanding, clear transparencies showing the
progress of hydrothermal experiments (involving microwaves as the
heating source), which caught the attention of one of my
colleagues who is working with more conventional hydrothermal
treatments. This was real state of the art stuff and exhilarating
too.</p>

<p>
To conclude the first part of the afternoon Christopher
Frampton (Roche Discovery, Welwyn) warned of the dangers of
polymorphic transformations that pharmaceuticals are suspect to
in the field, due to variable humidity and temperature. Chris'
first slide adequately stressed the importance of storage by
depicting a typical pharmacy in a third world country and noting
the difference in conditions from off the shelf preparations to
the possible phase transitions caused by environmental stressing.
His t
alk concentrated on two compounds creatine monohydrate and
Zopiclone and his XRPD patterns clearly illustrated the
difference environmental conditions can have on the structure
through hydration/dehydration processes. Trials are still under
way.</p>

<p>The crisp management of the first part of the afternoon
allowed discussion and debate to continue over tea and on return
Martin Soar (BP Amoco Chemicals, Sunbury) employing corporate
design in his lecture slides (yellow on green) reminded us of the

role of in-situ X-ray diffraction in catalyst development.
Knowledge of structure and crystallite size is important in
understanding activity as well as deactivation of many well-known
catalysts. The experiments that Martin described were attempts,
albeit sometimes disastrous to the equipment, to study materials
under realistic reaction conditions and he managed to chronicle
the industrial facility from the mid 1980's to the present
day.</p>

<p>And so last but not least John Evans (Durham Univers
ity)
rounded off with a tour de force considering it was the
penultimate lecture of the entire three-day conference, he
applauded the remaining audience for their "fortitude" in staying
the course. John's eloquent discussion of the phase transitions
that ZrV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> undergoes on cooling from a
high temperature simple cubic phase via an incommensurately
modulated phase to a room temperature 3 x 3 x 3 cubic
superstructure were linked to the negative thermal expansion
behaviour of the
 material. Laboratory based X-ray equipment and
powder neutron diffraction were the mainstay of John's variable
temperature investigation, similar he noted to that used by the
other presenters whom we had the pleasure of listening to.</p>

<p>Thanks also go to the organisers of the BCA conference
Georgina Rosair and Chick Wilson for arranging a stimulating
three days of scientific discussion and exchange of ideas. If
this has whet your appetite for more you might be pleased to make
a note in your d
iary of a follow up workshop on 21<sup>st</sup>
June organised by Dave Taylor and Jeremy Cockcroft at Birkbeck
College on non-ambient diffraction techniques.</p>

<p><b>Industrial Group Pharmaceutical Sessions Mon 3<sup>rd</sup>
- Wed 5<sup>th</sup> April 2000</b></p>

<p><b>Monday - Pharmaceuticals and Alun Bowen Lecture</b></p>

<p>The meeting was opene
d by Steve Norval, the chairman of the
BCAIG and was subsequently run by the session organiser, Philip
Lake. The lectures were on the theme of crystallisation
methodology and practice.</p>

<p>Stephen Byrn (Purdue University) chair-elect of the
Pharmaceutical Sciences Advisory Committee to the FDA presented
the Alun Bowen Industrial lecture on 'Crystallisation of
Pharmaceuticals'. Crystallisation of pharmaceuticals is a
critical step in a drugs development and the solid state form,
together with t
he method of synthesis, is the intellectual
property of the discovering party. The lecture represented an
excellent overview of polymorphism and crystallisation. Stephen
discussed the recent problem that Abbott experienced with
Ritonavir, where precipitation of a less soluble form forced a
product recall, in the context of polymorph screening and the ICH
polymorph decision tree. He covered crystallisation monitoring,
crystallisation of amorphous systems, finding the most stable
form using energy/tem
perature diagrams, effects of impurities on
crystallisation, salt selection, factors influencing particle
size and even 'factors' such as site specific solid-state
stability of drugs. Three non-solvated polymorphic systems, ROY
(and the 4-methyl analogue) and methyl nitroacetanilide (WAY),
were studied with the aid of energy temperature diagrams.
'Tunnel' hydrates of caffeine, theophylline and thiamine
hydrochloride were also cited.</p>

<p>Christian Lehmann (Max Plank Institute) described a multi-
well
crystallisation plate for simultaneous crystallisation and
subsequent examination using a micro-diffractometer and sample
translation stage (GADDS). Temperature controlled evaporative or
vapour diffusion crystallisation is possible. Para-methyl
chalcone, a system of several polymorphs, was cited as the
example used to evaluate the equipment.</p>

<p>Graeme White (Heriot-Watt) described an on-line analytical
approach to monitoring and understanding batch crystallisation of
organic speciality c
hemicals. The 'Chemicals Behaving Badly'
project was described. On-line techniques discussed included IR,
ultra-sonic spectroscopy, UV, laser Doppler anemometry as well as
XRD. Understanding growth and nucleation kinetics is key to the
project and consideration of scale-up factors such as
hydrodynamics and solid-liquid interactions was discussed. Urea
and glutamic acid were sited as examples.</p>

<p>The afternoon sessions comprised a series of plenary lectures
on the theme of refinement. Peter Erk
 (BASF) provided an
excellent lecture on behalf of the industrial group. Modelling of
structures and the simulation and predictions of properties has
recently gained momentum. The relationship between structure and
solid-state properties eg. Crystal form, solubility, habit,
density was discussed using examples from the organic pigment
industry (copper phthalocyanine, diphenyl perylene. The need for
a high degree of geometric and thermodynamic accuracy was
stressed if any computational predictive app
roach is to be
successful.</p>

<p align="RIGHT"><em>Robert Lancaster<br>
Glaxo Wellcome</em></p>

<b><a name="C"></a></b> 

<hr>
<p>Tuesday - Pharmaceuticals</p>

<p>Norman Shankland (Strathclyde University) gave an excellent
overview of the methods available for growing crystals of
suitable size for X-ray and neutron diffraction studies; this
focussed on the use of slow evaporation techniques, non-ambient
extremes, and the problems encountered when crystallising natural
products. Nick Blag
den (UMIST) described how solvents and
additives could be used to control the formation of specific
polymorphs by inhibiting progression towards the
thermodynamically most stable form and how crystallisation
conditions could be designed to yield a predicted polymorph.
Finally, Steef Boeringter (Nijmegan University) outlined the
current state-of-the-art in the area of crystal habit prediction
highlighting that although it is possible to calculate
morphologies the incorporation of growth conditions, s
uch as
solvent, temperature and kinetics, is highly desirable.</p>

<h2>Controlled Environment Workshop</h2>

<p align="CENTER">Non Ambient XRD Workshop, 21<sup>st</sup> June
2000</p>

<p>The summer solstice was celebrated in the school of
crystallography at Birkbeck college with a one day controlled
environment workshop jointly chaired by Dave Taylor (e-mail:
djtaylor@lineone.net) &amp; Jeremy
 Cockcroft (e-mail:
cockcroft@img.cryst.bbk.ac.uk). The morning sessions on high and
low temperature X-ray diffraction techniques (HTXRD) concentrated
on instrumentation &amp; environmental stages (Martin Vickers)
while the afternoon dealt with data handling (Andrew Jupe) &amp;
use of synchrotron/neutron sources.</p>

<p>The programme was delivered completely electronically via a
superb MS PowerPoint presentation &amp; internet web-pages, the
programme was projected onto a screen in the relaxed atm
osphere
of the Glaxo-Wellcome multi-media seminar room located in the
basement of the school of crystallography. The morning opened
with the factors influencing the development of HTXRD which
include sources &amp; x-ray optics, solid state electronics
particularly detectors &amp; the ease of automation through
computers &amp; software, all of which were introduced to study
in-situ dynamic processes. Possible reasons for wishing to employ
the techniques can be broadly divided between chemical:
oxida
tion, reduction, corrosion, hydration, phase transitions,
reaction kinetics and physical: crystallite size, thermal
expansion, strain, reorientation, structure analysis.</p>

<p>The sessions were introduced by the chair(s) alternatively in
a lively jovial manner and they encouraged active audience
participation and involvement (although perhaps not by as much as
had been hoped by the organisers) by discussion &amp; question
prompt. The use of HTXRD was compared with a range of
complementary methods
: differential scanning calorimetry,
thermogravimetric &amp; thermo-mechanical analysis, mass
spectrometry &amp; optical investigations &lsquo;all which
identify the temperature at which a change occurs without phase
identification&rsquo;. Needless to say a wide choice of settings
are possible for a particular experiment and compromise can often
be reduced to speed versus cost, dynamic studies inevitably
require rapid data acquisition which in turn can be translated
into high photon flux, fast effic
ient detectors and some special
optics including parabolic focussing mirrors. In summary sealed
tube can be used at &lt;3kV whereas rotating anodes at &lt;18kV
with various elemental anodes, in comparison a synchrotron with a
white beam has ~10<sup>12</sup> x intensity of a conventional
laboratory source.</p>

<p>Moving onto detectors Dave noted that scintillation /
proportional detectors were slow but offered good resolution with
pulse height discrimination. While on the other hand solid state
en
ergy dispersive (EDD for short) devices are stationary, require
liquid N<sub>2</sub> (which is expensive) and invariably have a
long dead time <font face="Symbol">t.</font> We were also
reminded that position sensitive detectors (PSD) provided fast
data acquisition with a 1D wire. But for state of the art it was
all down to 2D image plate Charge Coupled Devices (CCD&rsquo;s
similar to those in digital cameras) despite being very fast they
are also expensive. Rounding off with a few tips
"&hellip;don
&rsquo;t run a Cu tube above 45kV (it&rsquo;s
inefficient) &amp; remember that for I<sub>max</sub> with a
conventional diffractometer remove the secondary Soller slit"</p>

<p>On the topic of heating methods the advantages of using ribbon
heaters over induction methods was pointed out, this was well
illustrated with graphics and a specific example presented in a
poster (1998 Denver &ndash; Andrew Paysant, ORNL, USA) that
people could catch over coffee. Temperature gradients associated
with the stri
p seemed to be the main problem with reaction of the
strip and peaks from strips also causing problems. A microwave
stage in development by Andrew Harrison, Edinburgh (reported in
Crystallography News no. 73 June 2000 p. 45) was shown to be used
for solid state reactions &amp; sintering processes. Other
systems included Lasers, Induction &amp; Quartz lamps all very
much in development / research &amp; not yet on the market.
Problems with control invariably included overshoot, ramp rate
&amp; mainten
ance of pre-set temperature. For those of us new to
it PID temperature control (Proportional band, Integral time
constant, Derivative time constant) is the smart way of
overcoming some of these problems. The other major concern is
validation &amp; calibration of the attained temperature by
comparison with the ITS-90 fixed points, some useful phase
transitions are given below (these &amp; others are available in
an <a href="news/n00t2.htm">updated list</a> on the BCA
website):</p>

<p>Moving to the other extreme Jeremy stressed the advantages of
collecting data at low temperature "are principally to reduce the
thermal scatter and as a result improve the high angle data for
materials of pharmaceutical interest. Two different ways of
achieving this are by using either a cryostream or cryostat.
However before collecting data decide the object of the
experiment, a different sample geometry may be required for
structure refinement, e.g. in the case of ibuprofen (which
stro
ngly shows preferred orientation when measured on a
Bragg-Brentano diffractometer) you may require a capillary
geometry". Capillaries are needless to say the best sample
holders for low temperature manipulation. Illustrations for the
talk were taken from the in house powder diffraction web course,
an example (cryostat) web address used is
http://pd.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/pd/web-ad/lowtemp.htm. On the topic of
environmental stages the Bard (1564-1616) himself would have been
proud of the midsummer night&rsq
uo;s dream as presented by Dave,
the comedy not lost on the well-versed audience:</p>

samples</li>

<li>Rotation and oscillation</li>

<li>Very rapid data collection high accuracy at all 2<font face=
"Symbol">q</font> Angles<
/li>
</ul>

<p>Over a sumptuous poached salmon lunch participants were given
a guided tour of the industrial materials group X-ray facilities
by Martin Vickers who said of the tour "We showed everybody the
helium cryostat (1.6K) &amp; how we had adapted it to laboratory
powder diffraction. The kit we use in house is based on the STOE
Stadi-P transmission machine. We also got to see the Linkam
high-temperature arrangement on the SIEMENS D500 reflection
diffractometer". Previously the theoretical bu
llet points
concerning trade off between intensity (counts per second under
the unfavourable conditions) &amp; resolution (peak width) had
been emphasised but were brought in to sharp focus during a
practical demonstration by Martin (e-mail:
vickers@img.cryst.bbk.ac.uk.).</p>

<p>While on the subject of data handling Andrew Jupe (e-mail:
jupe@img.cryst.bbk.ac.uk) remarked that "If you want to present
bulk graphical data the best way to do this is with a 2D contour
plot routine, because it shows th
e crucial details. The freely
distributed FORTRAN graphics library PGPLOT is easy to use &amp;
well equipped to create this type of data plot ".</p>

<p>Contributions from the audience included a presentation by
Chris Frampton on the importance of combined PXRD and humidity
studies and an illustration by Clare Anderton on a problem
pharmaceutical powder which gave a different PXRD pattern 18
months after the initial one was taken. The longest day of the
year rounded off with a brief discussion of s

<h1>BCA IG STRUCTURAL MATERIALS WORKSHOP</h1>

<h2>RESIDUAL STRESS IN CONTEXT. HOW TO CHOOSE A TECHNIQUE</h2>

<h3>12<sup>th</sup> September 2000, Manchester</h3>

<p>The meeting took place in the <b>Manchester Materials Science
Centre</b>. Unfortunately, the severe fuel shortage in the
Northwest, and prob
lems with trains meant that a couple of people
weren't able to make it to Manchester.</p>

<p>The meeting started with an introduction to the Manchester
Materials Science Centre from <b>Judith Shackleton</b>. After
welcoming the delegates to the meeting, Judith presented an
outline of the facilities available in the Centre and emphasised
the wide range of equipment now in place, including the recently
installed Bruker D8 with XYZ stage, laser alignment and 2D
detector for residual stress measuremen
t. Other methods for
residual stress measurement based on magnetic and Raman
techniques were also described. Judith concluded by mentioning
the Network for Strain Measurement by Neutron and Synchrotron
Techniques, which has been set up to help new users to gain
access to major facilities</p>

<p><b>Phil Holdway</b> from DERA Farnborough introduced X-ray
diffraction methods. This is a surface technique, confined to the
top 100 or so microns, even when successive layers of material
are removed by El
ectro-polishing. Phil went on to describe the
many different parameters which influence X-ray residual stress
measurements (aside form the principal problems of obtaining
enough intensity and dealing with heavy, awkward shaped samples!)
including, grain size, texture, stress gradients, sheer stresses,
and instrument misalignments.</p>

<p>The relative merits of laboratory based and portable
instruments were also considered. A great many accessories are
now available for laboratory instruments, for 
example mirrors and
poly-capillaries. However, lab instruments are limited in the
size of sample which they can accept, it's a bit difficult to get
an engine block into one. Phil illustrated his talk by describing
some examples including some stress measurements around cold
expanded holes.</p>

<p><b>Jerry Lord</b> form NPL was next up speaking about Hole
Drilling. This is a widely used technique and work on virtually
anything which you can drill a hole in. Jerry started by
outlining the basics an
d some of the sources of errors. A new
ASTM standard has recently become available. Jerry went on to
talk about the merits and disadvantages of hole drilling and
finished off discussing some recent developments including taper
hole drilling, modelling and data analysis, (e.g. non-uniform
stress fields) and new applications such as thin coatings and
thermal barrier coatings.</p>

<p><b>Mike Fitzpatrick</b> from the Open University gave the next
presentation on Neutron Diffraction methods. The abilit
y of
neutrons to penetrate several centimetres into a material is a
unique property of the technique, although the sample has to be
taken to a suitable source rather than the other way round. It's
definitely not portable! Although the technique is expensive
compared to laboratory x-rays, it allows the non-destructive
determination of residual stresses in large components not
available by any other method. Primarily neutron measurements are
used to validate other techniques, for example finite elemen
t
calculations. Mike spoke about the differences between reactor
sources and pulse sources and discussed about advances in methods
for measuring surface stresses. Mike concluded that although the
cost of neutron measurements are very high, a new instrument,
currently being built should enable data collection times (and
hence the cost) to be reduced.</p>

<p>The next presentation was by <b>Andrzje Wojtas</b> from AST on
the portable stress measuring equipment. This was set up in the
basement. A bri
ef outline of the equipment was given along with a
demo (no x-rays were being produced), showing how the equipment
can be configured to operate on almost any sample. No need to cut
it up!</p>

<p>An excellent buffet lunch (wine supplied by Philips) was
provided, during which it was possible to see a demo of the new
stress software from Philips Analytical.</p>

<p>Having been suitably refreshed, it was now the turn of
<b>Angus Wilkinson</b> from the Materials Department at Oxford to
speak on the u
se of EBSD (Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction) to
investigate strains in semiconductor devices. Angus explained
that defects such as dislocations and the presence of residual
stresses could either be beneficial or detrimental to the
performance of the device. A brief explanation of the EBSD
technique was followed by an example of texture measurement
normally associated with this technique. Angus then went on to
talk about both plastic and elastic strains, the former giving
rise to a reduction in p
attern quality and the latter shifts in
Kikuchi line position or zone axis. Some recent work on SiGe on
Si substrate was used as an example.</p>

<p><b>Phil Withers</b> from Manchester Materials Science Centre
talked about the use of synchrotron x-rays to measure residual
stresses. These x-rays can have path lengths in materials such as
Aluminium of 5 - 100 mm. In addition they are very much higher
intensity which allows fast data collection. Phil listed a number
of examples of recent work such as 
machining, shot peening, and
friction stir welding. A case study on welding distortion was
then presented showing the rapid data collection (4000 points in
8 hrs), that can be used to map strain. These measurements could
be used to optimise the processing parameters and validate weld
modelling.</p>

<p>The last speaker was <b>Brian Shaw</b> from Newcastle
University who talked about magnetic techniques, (Barkhausen
noise). Brian showed the relationship between hardness/residual
stress and the leve
l of BN. This was followed by the benefits and
limitations and its application to the investigation of grinding
damage in gear steels. On of the principal advantages is that the
equipment is easily portable and can be used on very large
components, quote "You don't have to cut it up to prove that it
was OK". Examples such as industrial gear manufacture, burn
detection for gear quality control and gear failure investigation
were then presented. Brian finished off with a demo of the kit
and how calibr
ation might be made.</p>

<p>A lively discussion period, with a good exchange of ideas,
hints and tips ended the meeting in which a number of topics were
raised including ideas for a future meeting, data collection
issues and standards. Judith closed the meeting, thanking those
who attended. A tour of the x-ray diffraction facilities took
place for those who wished to stay.</p>

<p>Overall this was a very good meeting, with a good attendance
despite the difficulties and uncertainty for those comin
g by
car.</p>
