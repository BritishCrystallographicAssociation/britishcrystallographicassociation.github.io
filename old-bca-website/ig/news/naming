   Naming Conventions for files 

This directory stores IG newsletters, which are issued several times a year

1. The HTML files are divided into two parts, the newsy parts which quickly
get outdated, names are 
     NYR-n.html
where YR = last 2 digits of the year, n is the issue number

and the technical articles which remain of current interest these are named
    NYRTn.html
so that the two files can be identified as related.

2. The associated image files also have names relating them to the file which
calls them. e.g.
  file N97T1.html calls 97T1f1.gif 97T1f2.gif 97T1f3.gif 97T1f4.gif
  file N97-2.html calls 97-2F1.JPG
  file N97T2.html calls 97T2f1.gif 97T2f2.gif
  file N98T1.html calls 98T1f1.gif,
  file N98-2.html calls 98-2f1.jpg   
  file N98T2.html calls 98t2f1.gif  98t2f2.jpg  98t2f3.jpg  98t2f4.gif

rule:
    take calling filename, remove letter N at beginning
    add fn   where f denotes a figure  n is its number
