<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>The new format Newsletter we introduced for the last issue
seems to have been well received, so we have decided to stay with
it for the time being, but we are always open to (constructive)
suggestions
 or criticism and input.</p>

<p>We have a fairly busy newsletter this time, with a mixture of
forthcoming meetings, articles and reports. Your input is always
welcome, and if you wish to contribute, please contact Bruce Fox,
or any of the committee members.</p>

<p>Steve Norval has provided two items for this edition, an
excellent <b>Help!</b> note on standards, and an example of
elevated temperature XRD with the monitored thermal decomposition
of zinc acetate to zinc oxides, presented as a conto
ur map
below.</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>A lot has happened in the six months since the last
Newsletter. Another well attended Pharmaceutical Special Interest
Group meeting in March, Spring meeting at Leeds in April and a
Diffraction at Elevated Temperature Workshop in June. These are
all reported elsewhere in this issue I will just say thank you to
all involved with th
e arrangements and those who managed to find
time to attend. The first Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture at Leeds
by Prof. Paul Barnes was well received by a large audience and
was a fitting tribute to Aluns' memory. Paul has set a high
standard for others to follow.</p>

<p>The group AGM saw many changes to our committee and I welcome
the election Mary Vickers, Kath Clay and Philip Lake onto the
committee and Jo Jutson as our new secretary. I thank the
retiring members Colin Small, Craig Adam, Eric Ke
lly, Bruce Fox
and Derek Hart for their involvement in our activities. I am glad
that we have secured the services of Derek Hart as a BCA council
member to give an important industrial viewpoint on council
deliberations.</p>

<p>Our next meeting is the Autumn meeting being organised by
Keith Rogers at Cranfield University on 6 November 1997 (see
elsewhere for full details and fill in the enclosed registration
form now!). This meeting is your last chance to renew your
membership the painless way th
is year so if you haven't already
been to a meeting this year please try to find time to
attend.</p>

<p>Early next year we have a Pharmaceutical Special Interest
Group meeting and a short Spring meeting at St Andrews both
reported in this issue. Later next year we plan a workshop on
Residual Stress being organised by Kath Clay. If you want a
particular topic to be covered in a future meeting or have any
other ideas to improve the group or even want to share your
experiences in this Newsletter ple
ase let me know. The 1999 IUCR
meeting takes place in Glasgow so we are starting to plan
activities well in advance if you have ideas or comments let me
or any committee member know.</p>

<p>Finally we are trying very hard to keep our mailing list up to
date with the aim of getting a copy onto the desk of every active
Industrial Diffraction user in the UK. The circulation is now
over 400 and distribution costs are rising so if you have moved
out of the field please pass this newsletter to a colleag
ue and
let me know the relevant changes. We are reviewing the Industrial
Group content on the BCA WWW pages and back issues of this
newsletter and up to date news of events can be found at:-</p>

<!-- following url not linked refers to this site!-->
<p>(http://gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/index.html)</p>

<p>If you have web access please use our pages to keep in touch
with our activities. I hope you all enjoy a summer break from the
routine of work and come back refreshed with lots of ideas to
take
 the Industrial Group towards the next millennium.</p>

<h2>Mastermind success</h2>

<p>Tony Bell of Cambridge University, Chemistry, has scaled new
heights for the BCA by reaching the semi-finals of the BBC'
Master Mind series. The heats were held at the Cambridge Union on
Wednesday 25th November 1996. Tony's Specialist Subject was " The
Novels of Arthur C. Clarke"</p>

<p>The famous black chair is muc
h more intimidating in flesh than
on the screen. Apparently, the title music for Master Mind is
taken from a piece called " Approaching Menace" To the anxious
spectators this title was all too appropriate. Tony, however, was
not at all flustered. He answered the questions calmly, scoring
an excellent total of 35 points and coming first.</p>

<p>It was down to the Royal Naval, College Dartmouth for the
semi-finals on Wednesday 26th February. It' a very imposing, if
rather spartan building. Back to t
hat intimidating black
chair!</p>

<p>Tony' Specialist Subject was " The History of the Marathon" He
performed brilliantly.</p>

<p>The General Knowledge Section appeared to consist entirely of
questions about Ancient Greek Architecture and Classical
Mythology. No crystallography questions (what' the most common
space group etc.) and very few scientific ones. Despite the
adverse circumstances, Tony still managed to score 24 points and
come third.</p>

<p>An excellent achievement and a first for
 the BCA!</p>

<h2>18th International Union of Crystallography Congress,
Glasgow</h2>

<h2>August 4th-13th 1999</h2>

<p>Members of the Industrial Group will probably be aware that
the 18th International Union of Crystallography meeting will be
held in Glasgow from the 4th to the 13th August 1999 in the newly
built conference centre by the river Clyde near the city centre.
Hopefully, 2000-2500 crystallogr
aphers will attend, and the
meeting will cover <i>all</i> aspects of crystallography. Of
particular interest to industrial crystallographers will be the
intention to hold a specially focused set of symposia devoted to
powder diffraction - a sort of satellite meeting within the
framework of the main congress and lasting 3-4 days.</p>

<p>British crystallography has a proud past, and remains a world
leader, and everyone associated with the congress is keen to
present a meeting to remember, and one in
 which British science
is shown at its very best. In part this requires money, and money
requires sponsorship. Do you have suitable contacts that might
help? The organisers have prepared a glossy sponsorship brochure
which is being distributed as widely as possible. If you can
help, please contact Chris Gilmore who will provide copies of
this document and any form of backup that you need. (I am happy,
for example, to travel anywhere for discussions.) My address
is:</p>

<p>Please mark the dates in your diary, and be there: it will be
a great event, and apart from the science, a great social program
is planned!</p>
