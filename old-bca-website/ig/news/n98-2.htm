<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>This Newsletter sees the early departure of Dave Taylor and
the arrival of Steve Norval as Chairman of the Industrial Group.
Their reports are presented inside, but Dave's early retirement
and Steve's comments underline the uncertainty of modern British
Industry. Change is inevitable, but the rate and direction o
f
current practices make for a somewhat uncertain future.</p>

<p>However, we have had a successful series of meetings,
including a very wet St Andrews! The venue limited the number of
Industrial Users, but it proved lively and informative, with an
exemplary Scottish welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Mea culpa:</strong> the curse of the Grauniad struck
the last Newsletter, and I must apologise to Jeremy Cockroft for
translating him to Imperial - he still, of course, resides at
Birkbeck.</p>

<p><strong>
Thanks</strong> are due to Philips, Bruker and Raychem
Ltd for their financial support in producing and mailing this
newsletter. We are open for other manufacturers&rsquo; support,
offering the chance of targeting in excess of 400 industrial
users!</p>

<p><strong>Camera Techniques:</strong>We present the Wallace Ward
camera: see article</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>It is with some trepidation that I take the IG Chairman's seat
and try to follow Dave Taylor's lead from the last two years.
Dave has given an excellent account of recent developments in his
annual Chairman's Report. I do not intend to cover the same
ground but will confine myself to a few introductory
observations.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that we live in times of rapid change and
the working lives of industrial crystallographers present few

exceptions to this rule. Many IG members work in situations
demanding absolute focus on business interests with an insistence
on relevance and value from the rare occasions when noses are
lifted from the corporate grindstone, to be indulged by meeting
with other scientists (BCA meetings and the like). We have also
seen major changes in the industries that have supported our
activities. Many industries represented by the original IG
members are in severe decline, but other industries with new
crysta
llographic interests are emerging to take their place. It
is good to have a strong representation from this new generation
in the group. Meanwhile, the sophistication and potential of
laboratory x-ray diffraction has progressed beyond the wildest
imaginings of our founding fathers.</p>

<p>It is against this background that we owe a debt of gratitude
to Dave Taylor for steering and growing the group during times
that could so easily have seen us at a low ebb. I hope that you
all enjoy taking part i
n IG meetings. But I am also confident
that most members will be able to convince their management of
the value provided to them by our various meetings, workshops and
courses.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this year, we will be developing IG
activities with the Residual Stress Workshop and the Autumn
Meeting. Next year will see further change for us. The IUCr
Congress at Glasgow will dominate the conference and meetings
interests of many crystallographers during 1999. However, the
absence of the u
sual BCA Spring Meeting provides this Group with
a unique opportunity to try something different. We hope you will
like our proposals and that you will be able to persuade others
of the hard-nosed value that you will gain by coming along in
April. That is what your committee is seeking to provide. Please
let us know if you have concerns or suggestions that will help us
to achieve our goal. I, for one, am looking forward to an
interesting year and to working with an excellent committee in
achieving i
t.</p>
