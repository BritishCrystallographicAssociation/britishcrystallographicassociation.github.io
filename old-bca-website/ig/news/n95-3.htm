<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>This issue details the recent Autumn meeting, hosted by the
British Steel Corporation at their Swinden Research Laboratories
at Rotherham The theme, the analysis of small samples,
 proved
rewarding with a variety of differing inputs, as the enclosed
report shows, During the meeting Peter Salt was presented with
the IG award for his outstanding contributions to clay analysis
using XRD. The meeting saw the implementation of the new group
membership scheme, details of which are reported below.</p>

<p>Of interest to workers in the field of Residual Stress is the
report and call from Colin Small for participation in a European
initiative. It would seem to be extremely important 
to understand
and have input into any such move to create standards or
methodology. Several forthcoming events are announced in this
newsletter, together with a call for both papers (Autumn meeting)
and posters (Spring meeting) The latter is of immediate interest,
and in an attempt to bolster the number of entrants, Derek Hart
has agreed to act as co-ordinator for this Group. The committee
wants to encourage this mode of expression, and would remind you
that a prize is awarded far the best poster - 
so please contact
Derek if you wish to present a poster.</p>

<p>The Spring meeting also heralds an innovative attempt,
initiated by David Taylor, to broaden the understanding of
Industrial and Academic Diffractionists who may have been using
the technique as an analytical tool, but who may not have
received formal training in crystallography. We have been
privileged to secure the services of Dr Jeremy Cockroft who will
present a series of lectures timed around the Industrial Group
Sessions at Cam
bridge. This should prove to be an interesting and
informative approach and full details are given below.</p>

<h2>Industrial Group Membership</h2>

<p>From the 1996 Membership year, attending a qualifying
Industrial Group meeting will attract optional BCA membership for
that year, or for paid up members renewal for the following year.
The Spring meeting will not qualify because of administrative
difficulties. The change is 
aimed at attracting new industrial
group members and maintaining their interest in industrial
crystallography. It will cover normal, retired or student
membership. The new system will run in parallel to existing
membership arrangements. Any existing standing orders or Royal
Society of Chemistry or Institute of Physics payments will
continue unless changed by the individual member. If you intend
to attend at least one of the qualifying meetings each year you
may decide to take advantage of free membe
rship and make the
necessary changes to your present membership arrangements. Any
duplication of fees generated by this scheme will be used to fund
Association activities, no refunds will be made. A new meeting
form will include all the details required to process membership
applications. New applicants up to 30th September will be
enrolled to the end of that year. New applicants after 30th
September will be enrolled for the following year. Paid up
Members will have their membership renewed for the 
following year
(this includes new members who attend two qualifying meetings in
the same calendar year). Membership status of individuals will
continue to be advised in a fly sheet accompanying Decembers
Crystallography News.</p>
