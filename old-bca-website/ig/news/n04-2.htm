<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. In this
issue we have our usual reports, including the excellent Spring
Meeting, along with details of some exciting forthcoming events.
Please do try and come along and support these. The Industrial
Group Committee would welcome your comments and ideas for future
meetings. The Industrial Group is organising a 'DIY
Crystallography' meeting this autumn and need some contributions
urgently. I'm sure that many of you have come up with novel
solutions to problems with sample preparation, sample holders and
even data analysis. Why not share it with others. As part of this
meeting there will also be a session on Public Domain Software.
If you know where to look, there is a lot of excellent software
available, which can meet all your requirements. So please come
along in November and find out more. Another worthwhile exercise
is the low angle round robin and the instrument calibration test,
details of which are in this newsletter. Both of these exercises
will help provide you with information about the alignment of
your x-ray diffractometer. Finally a big thank-you for all the
contributions and as always, I would ask that you write a report
for the newsletter if you attend any x-ray related meeting.</p>
<p><b>Articles Wanted:</b><br>
 Why not put pen to paper and write a short article for our next
Newsletter. There are lots of examples to give you some ideas in
our Hints &amp; Tips section on the WEB. Don't forget, if you
attend a conference, please send in an article about it.<br>
We are also looking to expand the range of Industrial
Applications of XRD on our WEB Site. All we need are a few
well-chosen pictures and a few words. How about something on
CEMENTS, MINERALS, MUSEUMS, PHOTOGRAPHY, DETERGENTS, PIGMENTS,
POLYMERS</p>

<h3>PANalytical User Symposium - 28th/29th April 04</h3>
<p>Note an expanded version of this report is available in PDF
format: <img alt="Meeting Report PDF File (62Kb)" src=
"../images/PDF.gif" height="16" width="16"><a href=
"../dloads/PAN0404.PDF">FULL REPORT</a></p>
<p>The meeting was held at Dunchurch Park, Nr. Rugby - a former
manor set in 30 acres of picturesque woodland and grassed areas.
The symposium combined a series of technical presentations on the
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) techniques
with the UK launch of the Axios XRF Spectrometer.</p>
<p><b>Robin Aird (PANalytical Ltd)</b> described the new X'Pert
Highscore Plus XRD software available from PANalytical. Robin
said the software is a complete powder pattern analysis tool,
covering phase identification, cystallographic analysis and
Rietveld calculations. All of the common and many of the less
common data formats can be imported into the software and it
supports the internationally recognised CIF format for the
publication of XRD data. The Reporting interface has MS Word
compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Leain Grimsley (British Geological Survey)</b>, spoke about
her work in the sampling and analysis of soil in the Tavistock
district of Devon. The PANalytical MiniPal 2 energy dispersive
(ED) XRF instrument was used to measure As and Zn in soil. The
MiniPal showed good accuracy at the 0.1% level. Portable XRF's
can analyse up to 40 samples per day</p>
<p><b>Chris Staddon(Nottingham University)</b> described his work
on 'Spintronic' materials which consist of alternating layers of
low temperature and high temperature GaAs and GaMnAs. A Materials
Research Diffractometer (MRD) is used to obtain reciprocal space
maps and to obtain strain measurements. Chris said that strain
has been seen to relax as the coating thickness goes above a
critical limit. Annealing the coatings produces changes in the
XRD pattern which provides insights into diffusion
mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>Rob Foster (Exposure control section, H&amp;S
Laboratories)</b> described the XRF metal rubbing technique in
which diamond coated 'lapping' paper is used to obtain specimens
from metal surfaces. The technique is non-destructive, can be
used on any size of item and does not require the metal item to
be taken to the lab. Rob said that 0.003mg of Cr, Ni, Mn and Fe
could be determined within 1% of certified values.</p>
<p><b>Richard Morris (Huntsman Surface Sciences)</b> talked about
a sugar based structured surfactant system is a novel aqueous
delivery system that comprises surfactant, carbohydrate and
water. Sugar induced 'Lamellar' sheets are formed with a spacing
in excess of 500 angstroms. Richard explained how SAXS is used to
measure the bi-layer spacing, to 'tune' formulations and to
determine thermal stability. These systems suspend solid
particles and and allow the system to flow as a normal
liquid.</p>
<p><b>Cyril Marchant(PANalytical Ltd)</b> explained that
instrument breakdowns and performance problems fall mainly into
three catogories: vacuum, water and software, with the majority
of situations relating to the first two. He gave a number of
basic 'ground rules' to reduce running costs. Ensure that the gas
bottles (e.g. He and Ar) don't run completely empty before they
are replaced. Check gas bottles for leaks at regulators and
unions (use soapy water and watch for bubbles). Ramp up the kV
and mA when the tube is cold and don't switch it off from high
power (ramp it down slowly). Use sleep and dose channels when the
instrument is not being used and tube 'breeding' to run up
slowly. The water supply needs to be set-up correctly and
maintained. Periodically top-up a circulating water system and
check external water filters. Solid samples should be clean and
dry.</p>
<p><b>Martijn Fransen (PANalytical Ltd)</b> spoke about
non-ambient measurements using the X'Pert Pro instrument. Martijn
addressed some issues concerning non-ambient chambers. Sample
height should be measured before heating and corrected 'on the
fly' or afterwards. Parallel beam optics are better than
focussing optics since sample height can move over a mm without a
change of d-spacing. A d-spacing can be measured as a function of
temperature and compared with literature values or a temperature
calibration point defined where a known phase transition takes
place.</p>
<p><b>Philip Russell(PANalytical Ltd)</b> discussed detection
limits of difference XRF instruments. WDXRF instruments
(broadband excitation and selective detection) provide the best
detection limits, generally for light elements especially those
lighter than zinc. Detection limits for 'sequential systems'
(those that scan elements one at a time) are a function of the
total number of elements detected. EDXRF instruments (selective
excitation and broadband detection) have best limit of detection
for elements with atomic number &gt;40 (Nb and higher). Practical
limit is a function of the complexity of the system - e.g.
presence/absence of major elements in the vicinity of the
elements of interest.</p>
<p><b>Mark Russell(Queens University)</b> described his work on
Portland cements. He uses an Anton Paar Humidity chamber to
control the temperature and moisture environment of his cement
samples. The hydration characteristics of new and blended cements
are determined which are then used to predict reactions and
design new mixes.</p>
<p><b>Heather Harrison(British Geological Survey)</b> described
the use of the Epsilon 5 polarised EDXRF for the measurement of
soil samples in the Merseyside and North Wales areas. The high
excitation voltage gives good results for high Z elements. 300
samples per week are measured and have produced a geographical
map containing 35,000 samples!</p>
<p><b>Reg Nichols(PANalytical Ltd)</b> announced the UK launch of
the Axios-Advanced spectrometer, an instrument equipped for
'ultimate precision and demanding light element applications'. He
said it delivers unmatched performance incorporating numerous
cutting-edge technologies such as the SST-Max tube. Phil Russell
(PANalytical Ltd) gave Users more detail about the instrument. It
contains a Rh-anode SST-Max tube which provides tube stability
all the way up to 160mA improving analytical performance in the
light element range. There is an integrated sample changer and a
choice of loading mechanics which can be used to analyse up to
168 samples at a time. It can measure and analyse a variety of
samples including solid pieces, pressed and loose powders, fused
beads, liquids, foils, granules and thin films. There is also He
flushing and a dust collection device. The software includes
SuperQ 4, IQ+, Pro-trace, EP-multi, EDS and SPC. Phil said that
with a minimum of training, most day-to-day operation is a
push-button exercise.</p>
