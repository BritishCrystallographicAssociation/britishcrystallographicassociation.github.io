<p>100 years ago crystallography was in its infancy,
diffractometers did not exist and textbooks were non existent. If
you wanted to work in the field the first thing you did was build
the equipment and then understand the physics, only after that
could you make a measurement. Yet now look at us, the most
complex analysis is becoming routine, equipment is an off the
shelf item and there are libraries of books, analytical routines,
CD-ROMs etc. all available at the press of a bu
tton. Even more
impressive is the increased rate of change. Every meeting,
periodical, and paper seems to bring to ones attention new
developments at an ever-increasing rate. What worries me with
this increased rate of change have we forgotten to teach the
basics? We are so busy developing new tools hardware and
analytical software that we have forgotten that you need a
fundamental understanding of what you are doing in order to
ensure the quality of the answer you are giving. I have dealt
with som
e organisations who treat their systems like black boxes;
they put a sample in, press the button, and get the answer out.
Even worse is the answer 'It must be correct the machine said
so'. Not only is the answer wrong, they have no idea that (a) it
is wrong (b) why it is wrong. The BCA has a central role in
counteracting this attitude - we have the skills and knowledge to
help educate those that need it, encourage best practice and
communicate these ideas to everyone working in the area. All
those m
eetings and workshops are important - it is through this
medium we get our message out. So come on circulate the
information, get the BCA educational role noticed. You never know
- it might help someone and prevent a wrong answer.</p>

<h2>Newsletter Mailing list.</h2>

<p>To keep cost down and to ensure that the newsletter gets to
the appropriate people it is essential that we know your correct
address. Also if there is a mo
re appropriate contact in your
organisation or if you no longer require a copy please let us
know by contacting any of the committee officers.</p>

<p>If you would like an e-mail notification of the WEB posting of
future IG Newsletters then send an E-mail to <a href=
"mailto:djtaylor@lineone.net">djtaylor@lineone.net</a> - with the
title SUBSCRIBE WEB NEWS</p>

<h2>Spreadsheet Library.</h2>

<p><b>Library of Excel Routines 
for Diffraction and
Crystallography</b></p>

<p>The Industrial Group has set up a library of Spreadsheet
routines running on Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>The first release was made available for download on 19 Jan
2000. The files can be downloaded in a single zip file or just
the individual files you require from:<br>
 http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-mirrors/bca-spreadsheets/</p>

<p>If you have developed an XRD/Crystallography spreadsheet
routine you wish to share then please e-mail a copy to
djtay

<h2>The Industrial Group Web site</h2>

<p>The Web site has seen several changes over recent months. We
have simplified the start page by creating links to new index
pages for meetings, newsletters, group information and group
reports. The Industrial Group WebEditor (Dave Taylor) now has
access to edit and add web pages directly. This means that we are
able to update the site as soon as new material is ava
ilable.
Over the last few months the archive of past meeting programmes
and reports has been enlarged thanks to the efforts of Ian
Langford. Ian trawled through his files, before his retirement
from Birmingham University last year, and sent copies of many
early articles going right back to our inception in 1983. We now
have over 100 articles in this archive, but are still missing
some. Dave Taylor would welcome copies of any that are missing.
We also have a committee archive with photographs of offi
cers
past and present, if your picture is missing then send one in! We
would like to get more technical articles into our Newsletter and
on the WEB. Take a look at what we have from the Newsletter index
and start sending them in.</p>

<p>We are open to new ideas to enhance our WEB site so let us
know how we can improve it. Finally we don't always get it right
first time, so if you find any errors or omissions on our web
pages then please inform the WebEditor.</p>
