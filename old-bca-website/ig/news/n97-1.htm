<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Happy New Year! To celebrate 1997, we have decided to offer
you a new format for the Newsletter, with more emphasis on the
events to come and less reporting on the previous meetings. To
this end, only abstracts of the papers presented will be offered
together with contact details so that further information can be
obtained direct from the presenters. It is also envisaged that
fuller reports will appear on the WorldWide Web site, which will
be updated more frequently.</p>


<h3>Logo Competition</h3>

<p>The Industrial Group is considering its own additional
distinctive logo which will be used in conjunction with the
existing BCA logo on letterheads. It will also be used on
Crystallography News items to simplify identification of
Industrial Group content. A competition to design a suitable logo
is being held. Please submit your entry to Dave Taylor (address
on back page) as a drawing or a PC readable image file before 10
April 1997. The entries will be judged at the Sp
ring Meeting with
a prize for the one selected.</p>

<h3>Call For Posters</h3>

<p>In an attempt to improve the quality of our presence at the
Spring Meeting, we are appealing for posters to be presented.
Whilst we all appreciate the time and effort that these demand,
and that there are severe restraints within Industry on peoples'
time, the impact and utility of this mode of presentation cannot
be stressed too highly. If you have a subject suitable for
inclusion, please contact Steve Norval as s
oon as possible.</p>

<h3>Help!</h3>

<p>A new feature in this issue is the Help page, where we hope
that items or problems of interest can be aired. Please send any
copy for inclusion in the next issue to Bruce Fox.</p>

<h3>Special Interest Groups</h3>

<p>It has been decided by your committee to generate a selection
of Special Interest Groups within the Industrial Group, and on
Page 6, Steve Norval expands on the concept, and asks for
feedback on the idea.</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>I wish all our members a happy New Year. I hope that your
Resolution was to attend one of our meetings in 1997 or better
still to offer a talk or present a poster. I'm sure that you will
find something of interest in our programme, if not the let
myself or any committee member know and we'll try to fit it into
our future plans.</p>

<p>We are committed to developing Special Interest Groups (SIG)
and the first meet
ing of the Pharmaceutical Group under the BCA
umbrella takes place in March. The Leeds spring meeting has two
Industrial Group half day sessions and a workshop. Our plenary
has been renamed the "Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture" and I'm sure
that Paul Barnes will set a high standard for others to
follow.</p>

<p>The workshop sees Ron Jenkins putting us right on the
Instrument sensitivity problems highlighted by the Round Robin
exercise. A copy of his new book Introduction to X-Ray Powder
Diffraction 
-Jenkins and Snyder (Wiley &amp; Sons) is included in
the workshop fee (I paid &pound;65 for my copy) so it has to be
good value. Watch out for a review of the book in Crystallography
News. You still have time to register your poster for Leeds we
have been busy twisting arms and I'll be disappointed if we don't
improve on last years total (3). Don't forget there is a
&pound;50 prize.</p>

<p>In June we hold a workshop on Diffraction at Elevated
Temperature. If you have equipment, or plan a future p
urchase
this is one not to miss, it could be the start of another SIG.
The Autumn meeting sees Ian Langford reviewing the last 20 years
of diffraction and Mike Glazer predicting the future of the
technique. Remember attending an Industrial Group meeting
(excluding spring meeting) qualifies for BCA membership or
renewal.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed almost a year as chairman. I was saddened by
the deaths of Alun Bowen and Peter Salt - both contributed to my
personal knowledge of diffraction and will be s
adly missed.</p>

<p>Meetings on Reflectivity and Industrial Crystallography were
well attended and I thank Bruce Fox and Jo Jutson for their
efforts and Frank Cullen for the local arrangements at Harwell.
Industrial Group awards were made to Alun Bowen (accepted by
Chris Bowen) and Brian Bellamy.</p>

<p>Full details of our future meetings are reported in the
Newsletter. If you can' find anything of interest in our
programme then we are guilty of omission so please tell myself or
any committee m
ember any subject matter you would like covered in
our future meetings.</p>

<p>I look forward to our 1997 programme and I'm sure I'll see you
at one of our meetings.</p>
