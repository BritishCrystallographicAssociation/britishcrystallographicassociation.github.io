<h2>SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS</h2>

<p>The Industrial Group committee continues to look for ways in
which our crystallography community can mutually encourage one
another's expertise. One of the strengths of the Group is in our
range of interests across industries and techniques which most of
us find very stimulating. Sadly, the value of this
cross-fertilisation is not always so
 apparent to our employers.
The specialist seminars and workshops that are organised from
time to time should have a more obvious relevance. Through these
meetings, many practitioners are acquainted with the work of
other laboratories and know where to turn for advice when stuck.
The committee feels that the time is right to promote more
cohesion within groups of practitioners who have a common
specialist interest. The first such group has already been
established, comprising those with an interest 
in
pharmaceuticals. The group met last year with the BCA and is to
meet again this March under the auspices of the Industrial
Group.</p>

<p>The frequency and type of meetings appropriate to such a
Special Interest Group (SIG) will largely depend on the felt
needs of the members, but it is expected that round-table
discussions would be more common than formal presentations. SIG's
could meet on their own or associated with a regular Spring or
Autumn BCA meeting.</p>

<p>To take this idea forward,
 we now need to know the specific
interest areas which would be you would find most valuable. Some
are fairly obvious, e.g. we hope to establish a non-ambient group
on the basis of the workshop planned for June. I took the
opportunity at the 1996 Harwell Autumn Meeting to conduct a straw
poll of interests. With about 35 present, the audience was asked
for a show of hands in response to a list of technique and
materials interest areas. Deft counting by our Chairman produced
these figures:</p>

<h2>Round Robin Update</h2>

<p>The Instrument Sensitivity Round Robin exercise is almost
complete. Thirty data sets have been evaluated and the four
outstanding are promised by the end of January. A report to all
participants will be issued soon after. The conclusion of the
exercise will be a workshop at the Leeds spring meeting with Ron
Jenkins as the main speaker. A copy of Ron's new book
"Introduction to X
-ray Powder Diffractometry" is included in the
fee which considering that the UK price is &pound;65 makes the
workshop extremely good value for money. Overall the UK data is
worse than the USA data so there is some room for
improvement.</p>

<p>From the US data Ron derived a Figure of Merit (FOM) to test
instrument sensitivity - it is fully explained in his new book. I
have taken the data from Test 1c of the UK data to give
participants a benchmark to test their instrument sensitivity
against the 
rest.</p>

<p>The data from 10 and 46 are from the same instrument with the
46 data set obtained with a new X-ray tube of the same
specification.</p>

<p><img src="97T1f1.gif" alt="FOM plot"></p>

<p>If you want to use this FOM as a guide for testing your
instrument parameters the following method should be
followed.</p>

<p>The data is measured using your usual slits, 45 kV and max
mA.</p>

<p>The NBS SRM1976 Alumina plate is scanned from 50 to 55 degrees
(Cu radiation) using 0.02 degree st
eps and 4 second per step.</p>

<p>The intensity of the 52.5 peak is measured in counts per
second (cps) and Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) in degrees of 2
theta of the alpha1 peak. An average of the background from 51.0
to 51.18 and 54.0 to 54.18 in cps is used. All the data are
extracted manually from the raw data file. The larger the FOM the
better the performance. The NBS 1976 plate can be obtained in the
UK from Bureau Analysed Samples Tel 01642 300500. The FOM test is
also useful when adjusti
ng the parameters of an individual
instrument to maximise its sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating the FOM</strong></p>

<p><img src="97t1f2.gif" alt="Diagram for FOM calculation"></p>

<p>Some early conclusions can be made.:</p>

<p>There is a wide spread of performance, many instruments have
angular displacement problems which are easily overcome,
countrates are lower than US and intensities more variable.</p>

<p>Perhaps routine checks should be more widely used to ensure
that equipment
 performs to manufacturers specification and that
X-ray tube degradation is monitored. Routine checks should
monitor overall or angular dependent loss in intensity or shifts
in 2 theta values and changes in peak shape.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should ask yourself a few questions. How old is my
X-ray tube? When did I last check my intensities? Dare I run the
FOM test on my instrument? Why haven't I got my own SRM1976? Can
I afford to miss the workshop?</p>

<h2>Help! Proportional Counters</h2>

<p>The first of an occasional series of articles raising points
which may be of interest, and which will perhaps generate
discussion of how and why we should set up procedures to ensure
the X-ray instrument is performing correctly. This article from
Trevor raises an inte
resting set of questions and a possible
answer is given below.</p>

<h3>How do you set up your counters?</h3>

<p>Having recently had difficulties with a proportional counter
on a diffractometer, I have started thinking about how I set it
up and why. This has raised a number of questions about custom
and practice. Conversations with other Industrial Group members
has brought responses such as - 'I leave it to the service
engineer' or 'I have always done it <i>such-and-such</i> a way'.
I am in thi
s article purposefully avoiding introducing
scintillation counters into the controversy.</p>

<p>Setting up the counter involves selecting suitable values for
high voltage (HT), amplifier gain and lower and upper pulse
height analyser (PHA) levels. As each affects the others, it is
important that they are done in the correct sequence.</p>

<p>This article considers only the first step of setting the
counter HT. This involves progressively increasing the HT setting
with a constant stream of X-rays 
incident on the counter. During
this procedure, it is particularly important to set the PHA
window as wide as possible (commensurate with removing background
noise) otherwise false detector curves will be obtained.</p>

<p><img src="97t1f3.gif" alt="plot counts vs voltage"></p>

<p>The figure shows the output count rate from a proportional
counter as the HT applied to the counter anode is increased from
zero to 2000 volts or so.</p>

<p>There appear to be two main traditions for selecting the
op
timum HT setting which I will call the
'<strong>diffraction</strong>' and the
'<strong>spectrometry</strong>' methods. I was brought up in the
diffraction tradition in which the beginning of the plateau
region (marked <strong>D</strong>) is selected, on the grounds
that output signal is then at a maximum and the output signal
will be insensitive to drift in the HT supply.</p>

<p>Colleagues operating X-ray spectrometers choose a point in the
middle of the linear slope (marked <strong>S</strong>) wi
th the
justification that this gives true proportionality between input
X-ray energy (or wavelength) and output pulse amplitude (hence
the term 'proportional counter').</p>

<p>One might conclude that the needs of diffraction and
spectrometry are different, thus justifying different settings.
However, one diffractometer manufacturer has issued a handbook
indicating selection of point S as the correct operating
position. Another recommends setting the PHA window first and
then adjusting the HT for 
maximum counts. It is not clear what
point on the graph this selects.</p>

<p>Hopefully other readers will have views on this issue and I am
sure that the editor will be happy to offer them space.</p>

<p><strong>Some literature references to confuse you
further:-</strong></p>

<p>1. U W Arndt - Chapter 7 of X-ray Diffraction by
Polycrystalline Materials (Peiser, Rooksby &amp; Wilson, IOP
1955)<br>
<em>Describes the theory of counters and defines the
<strong>S</strong> region as the proportiona
l region and the
<strong>D</strong> region as of limited proportionality.</em></p>

<p>2. V E Buhrke - Chapter 3 of Handbook of X-rays (E F Kaelble)
McGraw Hill 1967.<br>
<em>Copies and expands Arndt's views. Defines a setting up
procedure corresponding to the diffraction tradition.</em></p>

<p>3. R Jenkins &amp; JL DeVries - Chapter 3 of Practical X-ray
Spectrometry, Macmillan 1970. <em>Details the various regions of
the HT graph, describing the <strong>S</strong> region as
'Proportional', the 
knee of the curve as 'limited
proportionality' and the plateau as the 'Geiger region'.</em></p>

<h3>Editor's Reply:</h3>

<p>Cullity (1) provides the best description, in particular the
section on proportional counters clarifies the queries raised by
Trevor. The graph shown above is reproduced in many publications,
but it relates the applied voltage to observed pulse height. A
more instructive curve is amplification factor vs voltage,
 as
shown in Cullity:</p>

<p><img src="97t1f4.gif" alt=
"plot amplication factor vs voltage"></p>

<p>From this, the amplification factor remains at 1 (ionisation
chamber region) until a critical voltage is reached where
avalanche occurs, and this leads to the
<strong>proportional</strong> region, where the pulse height is
proportional to the energy of the incident radiation. Beyond
this, corona ( Geiger region ) and then glow discharge occurs,
and proportionality is lost.</p>

<p>For diffrac
tion work, therefore, the position shown by Trevor
(D) is correct, Cullity suggests a point 100volts along the
plateau, where the counter is working in a proportional mode
(i.e. below the Geiger region ) but where HT variation will not
affect the pulse height. This latter consideration is less of a
problem in these days of solid state electronics. The corona
discharge region lies at the far end of the plateau, and results
in the sharp rise of response with voltage.</p>

<p>The issues raised by Trev
or are of interest - how many of us
actually check the conditions under which we are operating?
Certainly my understanding is that the PHA window should be
0-100%, with the goniometer set to a peak giving 2,000 to
4,000cps, to find and set the operating voltage on the plateau.
The plateau voltage will vary with the tube target used. Then a
narrow (2%) window is selected to give a pulse height
distribution curve, from which the upper and lower window levels
may be chosen. The problem these days with 
"black box"
electronics is that it is not always clear what conditions have
actually been chosen by the hardware if an automatic set up
procedure has been used.</p>

<p>If there are any other thoughts or comments on this subject,
please let me know, especially in these days of standard methods
and procedures.</p>

<h2>Spurious peaks from Sellotape</h2>

<p>I struggled for a some time with a problem peak which was
almost in the correct position for a beta phase of a particular
polymer, but correlation of the X-ray data with polymer
processing conditions proved impossible. By chance I discovered
that, if I inadvertently stretched the double sided Sellotape
holding the sample (we were not interested at that stage in the
amorphous content, so the tape covered the whole of the underside
of the thin sample), th
e "beta" phase peak appeared. A little
investigation showed that some makes of sticky tape give a
crystalline phase when only lightly stretched. So beware!</p>

<p>Any similar observations or tips would be gratefully
received.</p>
