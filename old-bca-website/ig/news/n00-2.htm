<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to a slightly later than usual Industrial Group summer
newsletter. My fault I'm afraid - I've changed jobs within
Rolls-Royce and it has taken longer than I thought to get the new
job and all the bits for the newsletter into some sort of order.
Still here it is.</p>

<p>One of the questions
 that is often asked is - how was such and
such a conference/seminar? Not only by my managers but also by
professional colleagues. This has got me thinking, there must be
a lot more meetings out there than the BCA IG events reported in
this newsletter. For example I've just spent 3 days at the
International Conference on Residual Stress. This is not a
crystallography meeting as such but 50% of the content was based
on crystallography. Also at least one poster and presentation
were looking forward to
 new diffraction based instruments at
neutron sources (in the UK ENGIN-X at ISIS). This must be worth
reporting on and letting people know that these things are being
discussed. Now I know some of the BCA IG were there - I saw you!!
So come on, there are a couple of hundred of you out there - what
have you attended recently and was it any use? Let us know!</p>

<p><b>Forthcoming Events<br>
</b> Structural Materials Workshop - 12 <sup>th</sup> September
2000, Manchester<br>
Autumn Meeting - 2<sup>n

<p>2001 BCA Spring Meeting - Reading University, 7 -

News and the next newsletter</p>

<p><b>Another Industrial Group Forum?</b></p>

<p>16 months ago the Industrial Group held its first ever Forum
in Coventry (IG Newsletter - July 1999). This was held because
there was no BCA meeting due to the IUCr in Glasgow and it was
felt that not too many of the IG would get to that meeting. It
was held over t
wo days in a hotel and the attendance and feedback
suggested that it was well received. The question is should we
try this again? If so when? 2001?</p>

<p><b>YOUR INPUT IS NEEDED TO HELP MAKE THIS DECISION</b></p>

<p>Thanks to <b>Bruker AXS</b> who sponsored the distribution of
the paper edition of this Newsletter.</p>

<h2>International X-ray Analysis Society (IXAS)</h2>

<p align="CENTER">International X-ray Analysis S
ociety (IXAS )
forms in Barcelona</p>

<p>A new type of scientific society focused on the use of X-rays,
neutrons, and electrons in materials characterization has been
established. This fully electronic non-profit society will have
free, open membership to the world's community of X-ray analysts
requiring only that they have access to the World Wide Web. The
purpose of the Society is to serve professionals working in the
field of materials analysis by: (a) fostering interaction among
materials sci
entists, chemists, physicists, geologists, and
others engaged in the use of X-rays and other radiations,
including neutrons and electrons, for materials analysis; (b)
sponsoring meetings of interest to those in the field of
materials analysis; and (c) disseminating information of interest
to the materials analysis community. The Society will provide the
following services to its member at no cost to them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Support network of Materials Analysts via e-discussion
groups<br>
<br>
</li>


<li>Job Clearing house - post your job notice or your resume
free<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Future Meetings Bulletin board<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Analysis Problems Bulletin board - ask the experts about your
problem<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Newsletter to be e-mailed containing articles of general
interest, News of IXAS, news of people, news of companies,
meetings reports, future meetings, future workshops, courses on
X-ray analysis - with translation to many languages by volunteer
members<br>
<br>

</li>

<li>X-ray Analysis Meetings Proceedings and abstracts on web<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Fully electronic Journal JXA on the web and free to all<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Data committee: XRF fundamental parameters on the web<br>
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, other activities like the development of "Best
Practices" procedures for analysis, etc. will become part of the
Society's work in the years to come. An international steering
committee<sup>*</sup> met in conjunction with the seventh
Euro
pean Powder Diffraction Conference in Barcelona on May 20,
2000 and completed the formal establishment of IXAS. The society
is now incorporated and the first five of the fifteen-member
board of councillors has been elected. R. L. Snyder will serve as
the first president with G. McCarthy as Treasurer, Peter
Wobrauschek, Secretary and Hideo Toraya and Rene Van Grieken as
the first two councillors at large. The Nominating Committee,
composed of D. Taylor (UK), Chair, V. Buhrke (USA), H. Goebel
(Germany
), H. Gohshi (Japan), and T. Huang (USA/Taiwan) will
propose candidates for a vice president and four more councillors
for election in August 2000 at the Denver X-ray Conference. The
final four councillors and next year's vice president will be
elected in the first Society-wide election in the Spring of
2001.</p>

<p>The Society is modeled along the lines of the "dot com" web
companies like Yahoo that pay for the services provided to
members via advertising. This new "dot org" society will use the

income from its sponsors to provide the services listed above as
more traditional societies do from the dues of the membership.
Officers and editors of the non-profit society will serve as
volunteers as is done in traditional societies. The Membership
Committee composed of M. Delgado (Venezuela), Chair, B. Holynska
(Poland), and S-F. Lin (China) is to define the membership web
form and establish any other procedures relating to the
maintenance and use of the membership roster. A Publications
Commit
tee composed of P. Scardi (Italy), Chair, T. Huang
(USA/Taiwan), and R. Van Grieken (Belgium) will work to establish
the guidelines for the operation of the Journal of X-ray Analysis
(JXA) as a fully electronic journal with free access to the world
community. In addition they will work to establish the
relationships with the world's analysis conferences to arrange
for the publication of their abstracts and proceedings on the
web, also available to all. Under these conditions the Society
hopes to ele
ctronically bring together the complete world
community of materials characterization scientists using the
techniques of X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction,
spectroscopy and absorption. To qualify for membership a person
must state that they are personally engaged in the use or study
of X-ray neutron or electrons for analysis. The only
responsibilities of membership are to vote in the annual
election, which will generate the next year's membership list,
and to grant permission to receive e-mail
 from IXAS and its
sponsors. The founding sponsor of IXAS is the International
Centre for Diffraction Data which provided the funds to the
Denver Conference Organizing Committee to establish the
International Steering Committee<sup>*</sup> which has meet once
in Frankfurt and again in Barcelona to complete their task of
incorporating and defining the bylaws of the Society. The EPDIC
steering committee has appointed Eric Mittemeijer as a
representative to the IXAS council and the IUCr's Commission on

Powder Diffraction has also agreed to name a representative to
council. The first version of our web site is available at
<b><u><font color="#0000ff">www.ixas.org</font></u></b> where the
community is urged to join.</p>

<h3>Free Diffractometer - from WBB Technology</h3>

<p>WBB Technology have r
ecently bought a new diffractometer to
replace their ~10 year old one which is still fully operational.
It is a Philips PW1800 powder X-ray diffractometer which has a 20
position sample changer.</p>

<p>It is available free-of-charge to any potential user who would
pay all transport costs in taking it from their laboratories in
Newton Abbot.</p>
