<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to 1998, and Best Wishes for successful 
year! This is
the first issue to carry Ron Pflaumer&rsquo;s logo design - more
details below.</p>

<p>This edition also carries the sad news that Dave Taylor is
resigning as Chairman, due to early retirement from Pilkingtons.
We wish him well for the future.</p>

<p>Details of this year's events are included, together with
application forms for the Pharmaceutical and Spring Meetings.</p>

<p>Glasgow 1999 is not too far away, and a pre-Registration Form
is enclosed. Your committee would be please
d to receive ideas and
thoughts for the Industrial Group input into this meeting, so
please contact any of the committee members. Industrial Group
Committee, appears at the head of this page.</p>

<h2>Logo Competition</h2>

<p>Thank you to all who took part and showed interest in the
competition. No objections to a new logo were received and we
intend to try out the winning entry over the next few months.
However, if you still think you can do better please send in your
suggestion and we may able
 to use it in the future. The winning
design is by Ron Pflaumer. A little subtle editing recommended by
the judges has been applied. It is seen as representing the
Bragg-Brentano optics common to many industrial applications. A
prize of a &pound;20 book token has been awarded to Ron for his
efforts</p>

<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>The Editor and committee would like to express their thanks to
Pilkington Technology Centre for the printing and distribution of
the last newsletter, and to Raychem Lt
d. for extending similar
facilities for this one. With a distribution of approximately
400, the time and costs involved are not inconsiderable and the
help is much appreciated.<br>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p> Best Wishes for the New Year to all our members and
supporters. I hope you were able to attend one of our meetings
last year and that you will make every effort to come to one of
our planned events this coming year. There is a wide choice
includin
g sessions on: Pharmaceutical SIG, Powder diffraction
hardware /software developments, Data quality workshop, Elevated
temperature SIG, Residual stress workshop and an Autumn meeting
covering general interest topics. More details on all these
events elsewhere in this issue. I think you will agree it is an
interesting and varied programme. However, if you don&rsquo;t see
something in our programme of interest this year, then contact
any committee member or myself and let us know the topics you
would 
like to see covered in the future.<br>
</p>

<p> Remember that by attending a qualifying meeting your BCA
membership will be renewed. Our theme for St Andrews is Powder
Diffraction Data acquisition and quality with the co-authors of
"Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry" involved in the
programme, along with presentations from major hardware
suppliers. It's all packed into a couple of days and the sea air
is thrown in to blow those winter blues away!</p>

<p> I hope you like Ron Pflaumer's
 winning entry in the IG logo
competition (shown elsewhere in this issue) and that it will help
you easily identify our content in future publications. The
quality of the entries made choosing a winner difficult. We had
half a dozen entries to choose from and I thank all those who
submitted entries. However, we are always open to new ideas, so
if you think you can do even better send your idea to Jo
Jutson.</p>

<p> On a personal note I have decided to take early retirement
from Pilkington and wil
l be leaving the company on 31.3.98. As a
consequence I will resign as chairman of the Industrial Group at
the St Andrews AGM, a year earlier than planned. However, I still
plan to pursue an active role in the X-ray field so you
haven&rsquo;t seen the last of me yet. In fact for those of you
attending the Denver conference I will be presenting an update on
the UK Intensity Round Robin as part of a workshop covering the
exercise worldwide. It is not too late to take part in the Round
Robin, you can n
ow do the tests and process your own results by
using the self test files available for download from the BCA web
site.</p>

<p> We do occasionally get things wrong and I apologise for the
early publication of our last issue. We gave the result of Tony
Bell's appearance on Mastermind before the BBC screened the event
and unfortunately spoiled the enjoyment for some. I take all the
blame as Pilkington agreed to fund the copying and postage for
that issue and we managed to do it in record time! (The 
fact that
I was about to go on a much-needed holiday did play a small
part).</p>

<p> The next IUCR congress is in Glasgow next year (4-13 August
1999). What involvement would you like to see from the Industrial
Group? What event or programme content would make it a meeting
you could not afford to miss? Send your ideas to Jo Jutson before
the end of March for consideration at the St Andrews meeting.</p>

<p> I would like to take this opportunity of thanking your
committee for all their efforts on
 your behalf over the last year
and know that with their dedication the group will continue to
provide a balanced and rewarding programme of activities over the
coming years.</p>
