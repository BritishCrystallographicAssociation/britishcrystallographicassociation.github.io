<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>This is my first newsletter as editor, so any comments on the
layout and co
ntent would be welcome. Thanks to Colin Small for
his efforts over the past couple of years. Things are now getting
back to normal after the Spring Meeting at Reading. For those of
you who couldn't make it, this was an excellent meeting with good
attendance at the IG sessions. Thanks to all those who spoke and
especially the three speakers at the basic powder diffraction
workshop. To be able to stand up and talk for a couple of hours
requires a great deal of thought and preparation.</p>

<p>I know 
that we are all under pressure at work these days; but
would you think about submitting a technical article about your
work. This could be a short description of some work recently
carried out, tips on sample preparation or advice on a particular
technique. This type of article has been well received in
previous newsletters. Also, if you attend a conference or
meeting, which has some crystallographic content, please consider
sending in a short report.</p>

<p><b>Possible changes to the Industrial G
roup
Constitution?</b></p>

<p>As Steve Norval mentioned in his article, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to attract new committee members. It seems
that the time has come to consider changes to the way that new
committee members are elected and their terms of office. This
would require changes to be made to the Industrial Group
Constitution.</p>

<p>This is YOUR chance to have a say in how the group is run and
organised. Please have a look at the Constitution on the IG web
site, and let me
 have your comments or ideas for changes.</p>

<h2>Newsletter Mailing list.</h2>

<p>To keep cost down and to ensure that the newsletter gets to
the appropriate people it is essential that we know your correct
address. Also if there is a more appropriate contact in your
organisation or if you no longer require a copy please let us
know by contacting any of the committee officers.</p>

<h3>Bruker AXS Ltd - User Group Meeting</h3>

<h4>30th April - 1st May 2001</h4>

<p>Bruker AXS held an XRD User Group Meeting at The Bank House
Hotel, Bransford, Worcester on Monday 30<sup>th</sup> April and

Tuesday 1st May 2001which was attended by around 40 delegates.
<b>Andrew Keir,</b> DERA Malvern, gave the first presentation on
Monday on the high resolution X-ray diffractometry of
semiconductor alloys. One example of the use of a high-resolution
diffractometer was in the measurement of the lattice parameters
of GaAs (a=5.6533) and AlAs (a=5.6523). Another application
described was the measurement of lattice parameters to
characterise the composition of the GaN/AlN system. This
semiconductor has a
 sapphire substrate
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), a layer of GaN and then a layer of
AlGaN. The AlGaN layer has built in strain due to its attempts to
fit to the lattice parameters of the underlying layers. This
strain shows as a small change in lattice parameter which can be
detected using high-resolution diffractometry</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The second presentation was from <b>Phil
Holdway,</b> DERA Oxford. Phil described the hardware and
software used to measure strain in helicopter blades. Wi
th an XYZ
sample stage and small collimators it is possible to analyse
large samples from the blades and at various positions on the
samples. The software used measured strain from diffraction peak
shifts and residual stress calculated from the strain. Phil
pointed out that the need to take into account variations in
texture when analysing the data.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Chris Morgan</b> from Johnson Matthey,
followed with a presentation on the post-mortem characterisation
of autocatalysts. A
utocatalysts consist of a precious metal
sprayed on a high surface support material such as
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> which is then coated onto a ceramic
or metallic substrate. XRD can be used to identify the
crystalline components of autocatalysts under different
conditions. These include the initial state of the autocatalyst,
thermally induced changes during ageing and the effect of
poisoning. XRD is also used in the development of new
autocatalysts. Chris described a case study for a customer w
here
XRD analysis was used to determine the thermal history of an
autocatalyst under test.</p>

<p><b>Dave Stewart,</b> BNFL Magnox, described the wide range of
irradiated and uniradiated materials that are analysed by XRD at
the Berkeley Technology Centre. Examples of analyses included the
oxidation of welds, the quantification of magnetite, haematite,
retained austenite and sigma phase in steels, the oxidation of
copper and the investigation of magnox combustion products. He
also presented a cas
e study describing how XRD was used to
identify changes in the lattice parameter and crystallinity of
graphite moderator samples caused by irradiation damage.</p>

<p><b>Joe Hriljac,</b> University of Birmingham gave a
presentation on XRD studies of Bismuth Molybdovanadates in the
system Bi <sub>1-x/3</sub>(V <sub>1-x</sub> Mo <sub>x</sub>)O
<sub>4</sub>. Part of the studies involved determining the range
of x for which solid solutions existed. At high values of x a
solid solution existed with a su
perlattice. High temperature
studies indicated that BiVO4 undergoes a phase transition to give
a CaWO<sub>4</sub> type structure.</p>

<p><b>Ian Slipper,</b> University of Greenwich gave a talk
entitled "Determination of Glass content of ground granulated
blast furnace slag GGBS". This slag is a by-product of the steel
industry and used as an admixture to cement. If the crystallinity
of the slag is too high (above 67%) it cannot be used as cement
additive. The BS Standard method of measuring the cr
ystallinity
of the slag is to profile fit the X-ray diffraction pattern to
separate the crystalline and amorphous components, print the
pattern, cut out the amorphous and crystalline peaks and weigh
the paper cut outs. With PC based pattern evaluation software
(EVAL) it is now possible to remove the amorphous component and
then calculate the area of the crystalline peak directly.</p>

<p><b>Judith Shackleton,</b> University of Manchester Materials
Science Centre, looked at XRD Stress Mapping of Ine
rtial welds
using a GADDS system. Inertial welding is carried out by slamming
a spinning component into a stationary component and allowing
friction to form the weld. Neutron diffraction had been used to
analyse a test piece of Ni superalloy welded in this way and the
lattice parameters calculated from whole pattern fitting. As the
hoop, axial and radial residual stresses calculated by neutron
diffraction were not as expected analysis was also carried out on
slices of weld areas from this sample usi
ng the GADDS system at
Manchester. It was possible to see the weld with the video camera
on the GADDS system and determine exactly where to carry out
analysis. Happily, the results obtained were found to be in
agreement with the neutron diffraction results</p>

<p><b>Jo Jutson</b> (ex BICC Cables) described how
microdiffraction could be carried out using a GADDS system,
allowing the analysis of very small samples from cable
components. Sample preparation time and analysis time was greatly
reduced 
compared with analysis using a conventional
diffractometer. Typical analyses carried out were variations in
phase composition of cable components and identification of
impurities. The technique had a particular application in the
analysis of superconductor tapes. These tapes are typically 3mm
wide and 0.5mm thick and could contain about 30 filaments of
conducting material in a silver casing. With microdiffraction it
was possible to analyse individual filaments about 500<font face=
"Symbol">m</font> 
m wide. Variations in phase composition of
filaments across the tapes could be determined from the ratio of
2223/2212 superconductor peaks and variations in texture could
also be measured.</p>

<p><b>David Taylor</b> (ICDD) closed the presentations with a
talk on ICDD developments. At present there is a reduction in the
number of powder diffraction patterns being published in papers
and ICDD now pay diffractionists to produce new patterns via the
Grant-in-Aid program. Some patterns are calculated f
rom single
crystal data. To date there are over 130,000 patterns in the PDF
(powder diffraction file); sets 1-50 are from experimental data
and sets 70-88 calculated from ICSD data.</p>

<p>Software for the PDF has been updated with PCPDFWin allowing
windows accessibility and PCSIWin software is an alternative to
the paper search manual. The new Relational DataBase (RDB) will
give a more flexible search environment and allow easier updating
of information. Metals and Alloys is the first RDB to be

marketed.</p>

<p>The Bruker AXS technical presentations on the second day of
the meeting covered a wide range of new and improved hardware and
software products and their applications. All of the
presentations over the two days of the meeting were very
interesting. Many thanks to Bruker AXS for organising the
meeting.</p>
