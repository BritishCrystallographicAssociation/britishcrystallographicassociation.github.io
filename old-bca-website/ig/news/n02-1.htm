<h3>Durham Conference on X-ray Analysis</h3>

<h4>September 10-13 2001</h4>

<p>The 22<sup>nd</sup> International Durham Conference 
on X-ray
Analysis was held at the  University of Durham on 10<sup>th</sup>
-13<sup>th</sup>  September 2001. The conference was organised by
Philips Analytical and as in previous years the venue was Durham
Castle which has the status of a World Heritage site. The
conference was packed with interesting presentations and there
was a full XRF programme in addition to the XRD sessions.</p>

<p>The technical programme began with  "A hitchhikers guide to
X--ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence" followe
d by sessions
devoted to all aspects of these two techniques. Papers presented
by Philips representatives included new developments in hardware
and software and some of the applications resulting from these
applications. Presentations included  "New Instrumentation-New
Opportunities, in which <b>Philip Lake</b>, GlaxoSmithKLine
showed how the adaptability of the modern diffractometer
configuration has aided characterisation and quantification of
the various solid state forms of drugs.  <b>Chris Stad
don</b>,
University of Nottingham discussed X-ray studies of N doped GAAS
as an application of the Mirror/Monochromator on the X'Pert MRD.
These sessions were very useful for delegates considering the
purchase of new instruments or upgrading existing
instruments.</p>

<p>The XRD Plenary sessions included a presentation by <b>John
Faber</b>, ICDD on "New Developments in Database Development and
Data Mining". John reported that there are now 125,000 records in
the ICDD databases and  in addition to 
patterns based on
experimental data there are an increasing number of calculated
patterns.  Relational Databases (RDB) are now being developed.
PDF-4/Metals and Alloys were released in 2000, PDF-4/Minerals was
released this summer and a full version will be released in 2002.
These databases contain full patterns, which are a fingerprint of
each compound. The databases also include crystallographic data
from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. John gave some
examples of datamining using RDB's. On
e example involved finding
the distribution of crystal systems and space group populations.
A search for Ln<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> structures gives all
structures, spaces groups and structure groups plus the stability
of rare earth oxides. <b>Steve Norval</b>, ICI presented the
second XRD plenary lecture "European Diffraction Standards-why
should I care".  Steve discussed the problems associated with
comparing data produced by different instruments. The European
XRPD standards are designed to over
come these problems. The five
documents are "General Principles", "Procedures", "Instruments",
"Terminology" and "Reference Material". Instruments could be most
significant, providing a basis for specifying an instrument
configuration, then following the alignment, calibration testing
and monitoring sequence.</p>

<p>The XRD sessions included 3 "Practical Master Classes". The
first covered "Sample Preparation and Spray Drying and was
presented by <b>Steve Norval, ICI and Steve Hillier</b>, Macauley

Land Use. The emphasis here was on the problems created by
preferred orientation and how to remove it. Steve Norval
discussed the results of a "Round Robin " which had been the
basis for a workshop at  the BCA Spring Meeting at Heriot Watt
University. He described the sample preparation options of side
filling, front filling, back filling, a slurry on single Si
crystal, spray drying and capillaries. The results of the Round
Robin showed that spray drying was best with the use of
capillaries nearly
 as good. Steve Hillier continued the session
concentrating on the spray drying technique. In the past this
method has required high cost equipment, gave poor product
recovery, was time consuming and was unsuitable for small
samples. New developments in the technique have made it
relatively low cost. Using a modified airbrush to produce the
spray it is possible to collect a product which consists of
spheres which will produce random packing and reduce
orientation.</p>

<p><b>John Faber</b>, ICDD p
resented the 2<sup>nd</sup> master
class on "Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis". John began with
a brief history of powder diffraction databases and continued
with a discussion of the use of Hanawalt and Fink Indexes to
identify compounds and mixtures. This was followed by an overview
of "Automatic Search Match" from first generation methods to the
present day.  Finally John described the fourth generation search
match programs with the emphasis on total pattern matching and
the possibilities to
 include quantitative analysis.</p>

<p><b>Paul Fewster</b>, Philips Analytical Research Centre and
<b>Dave Taylor</b>, Consultant presented the third master class.
The topic was "Calibration and Alignment" and David opened the
session with a discussion on the UK Round Robin carried out by
the Industrial Group, BCA  which  tested the performance of 30
diffractometers.  Details of the results, how to carry out the
tests and how to obtain good XRD standards are on the IG pages of
the BCA website. In 
the second half of the session Paul discussed
diffractometer configuration and the different instrument
settings such as slits and X-ray tube required to obtain high
resolution or high intensity. This was followed by an overview of
the basics of correct diffractometer alignment.</p>

<p>Other XRD sessions included "X-ray Scattering" which began
with <b>Paul Fewster</b>, Philips Analytical Research Centre
describing what happens from "source to detector". This included
the assumptions made about dif
fractometers and samples and
therefore our interpretation of data obtained. Paul discussed the
use of slits, mirrors and crystals,  factors affecting
resolution. He covered the geometry of diffraction for single and
polycrystalline materials, the effect of a diverging beam and
spread of wavelength, the effect of focus size on peak intensity,
wavelength selection and tuning the wavelength with the
monochromator. <b>Chris Hammond</b>, University of Leeds followed
with a presentation on "X-ray diffract
ion from Multilayers and
Single Crystal Thin films" which covered the ways in which
multi-layers and single crystal thin films can be studied in the
diffractometer. <b>Peter Petrov</b>, South Bank University,
discussed the evaluation of residual stress in thin/thick films
using grazing incidence diffraction. The examples he used to
demonstrate the technique were SrTiO3 which has a cubic
peroskovite structure and a superconductor 
YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-X</sub>.</p>

<p>A session on g
eneral X-ray diffraction applications looked at
a broad spectrum of techniques and applications<b>. Marcus
Neumann</b>, Accelrys Ltd discussed structure solution from
powder diffraction. Direct space methods used a combination of
indexing, Pawley refinement, structure solution with RelfexPlus
and Rietveld refinement. Structure solved included those for for
Alfizosine (an alpha blocker) and tetracycline hydrochloride.
Even moderate degrees of preferred orientation can prevent
structure solving but th
e determination of a preferred
orientation correction factor has improved structure
determination.</p>

<p><b>Richard Morris</b>, Huntsman Surface Sciences, described
how "Small Angle X-ray Scattering" (SAXS) can be used to measure
the Bragg spacings of the lamellar phase in surfactants. These
spacings increase in size with water content. This has lead to
the development of continuous on-line measurement of the phase
bound water content in concentrated surfactants.  <b>Martin
Gill</b>, Imperial Co
llege showed how clay minerals could be an
indicator of climate change. Climate changes can lead to
irreversible changes in clay structure.  XRD  determination of
Hampshire Basin deposits have shown cyclical astronomical effects
on the earth climate reflected in clay structure .</p>

<p><b>Patricia Kidd</b>, Philips Analytical Research Centre,
described the applications of in-plane scattering. The incident
beam enters a sample at an angle close to zero and penetrates the
sample surface down to a ma
ximum depth of 100nm. The beam follows
a path approximately parallel to the surface so that scattering
occurs from crystal planes approximately perpendicular to the
sample surface. Using this method lateral grain sizes or crystal
homogeneity can be measured.</p>

<p><b>Judith Shackleton</b>, University of Manchester Materials
Science Centre, looked at XRD Stress Mapping of Inertial welds
using a GADDS system. Inertial welding is carried out by slamming
a spinning component into a stationary compone
nt and allowing
friction to form the weld. Analysis has been carried out on
slices of weld areas using the GADDS system at Manchester. It is
possible to see the weld with the video camera on the GADDS
system and determine exactly where to carry out analysis. 
<b>Jodie Guest</b>, University of Wolverhampton gave a practical
evaluation of quantitative Rietveld Refinement of powder X-ray
diffraction Data. The Rietveld  method offers advantages over
conventional XRD methods and Jodie demonstrated the ca
pabilities
if the method for a range of samples.</p>

<p><b>Andeas Grimstvedt</b>, Geological Survey of Norway
discussed quantification of rock deposits with XRD based on
Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression. Calibration materials
were obtained from mineral separation and then the separated
minerals mixed in different weight proportions to give
standards.  Generally calibration based on PLS gave better
results than traditional methods. <b>Colin Small</b>, Rolls-Royce
plc gave an overview of new 
geological problems for jet engines. 
Item such as birds, spanners, volcanic ash or sand can be sucked
into the engines causing damage. New problems associated with
this include the cracking of corrosion and oxidation resistant
alloys designed to operate at very high temperature. Colin
described how XRD phase analysis lead to an understanding of the
mechanism of the cracking and the design of a solution.</p>

<p>On the last day of the conference there was a joint XRD/XRF
session on "The quality of 
the analytical result. The speakers
for this session were <b>David Dyson</b>, who gave his personal
view of the requirements (as set out in ISO 17025) for validation
of methods and quality of results in relation to XRD/XRF.   
<b>Elizabeth Pritchard</b>, Laboratory of the Government Chemist,
first discussed the aim of the Valid Analytical Measurement
program (VAM), the six VAM principles and how they link into the
requirements of ISO17025 . Elizabeth's second talk concerned
measurement uncertainty a
nd its estimation and gave an
introduction to the ISO rules of calculation uncertainties.</p>
