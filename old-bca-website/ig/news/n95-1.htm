<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Once again we are preparing for the BCA Spring Meeting. In
1995 this will be at the University of Wales, Cardiff. As usual
the Industrial Group will be organising two half-day sessions on
Tuesday 28th March and these have the titles 'Novel Materials'
and 'Rietveld Analysis in Industry'. To follow these, on 29th and
30th March, we have an 'Advanced Powder Diffraction Course' which
will be of interest to all who use the Powder Diffraction File.
Full details of all of these are given on the following
pages.</p>

<p>Those of you who are BCA members will recently have received
the December issue of Crystallography News and an accompanying
form giving your membership details. That form invites you to
underline One Main Interest Group and to circle as many Special
Interest Groups as you like. The BCA now allocates a small
capitation allowance to the groups in proportion to the number of
'main interest' members. For those who select us as a 'special
interest', we get only your name and address.</p>

<p>Please therefore give some consideration as to how you wish
your subscription to be used. If you wish to support us
financially then please ensure that you select the Industrial
Group as your MAIN INTEREST.</p>

<p>Also in this issue is a report on the recent meeting at
Raychem, Swindon on 'Real Problems? - Real solutions using X-ray
Diffraction' and preliminary details of forthcoming meetings.</p>

<p>The Industrial Group Award was again made towards the end of
last year. It recognises the contribution to our discipline made
by those, particularly in industry, who may not have had the
opportunity to publish the results of their research. Nominations
for this award are always welcome and can be sent to any of the
committee.</p>

<p>Also included in the following pages is formal notice of the
next Annual General Meeting of the Group and a call for
nominations to the committee.</p>

<p>The committee sends its best wishes for a prosperous new year
to all group members. We look forward to your continuing support
at our meetings</p>

<h2>Spring Meeting - Cardiff - 1995</h2>

<p>This will start with a plenary lecture from Ron Jenkins of
ICDD. He will show how the Powder Diffraction File has, since its
inception more than half a century ago, striven to ensure that
the content and quality is commensurate with current and past
materials analysis technology. Topics discussed will include the
Grant in Aid programme supporting research by institutions
involved in the development and production of novel materials,
the enhancement of the file to its current level of nearly 70,000
entries and the recent introduction of computer-based search
manuals. These offer the analyst a much higher degree of
flexibility in the analysis of special materials through the use
of PDF subdivision and the use of elemental pre-screens and
quality marks. Also mentioned will be recent products for
analysis of Metals &amp; Alloys and of Polymers and also a brand
new database based on the use of fully digitized patterns for
Clays and Related Minerals.</p>

<p>This presentation will be supported by an Advanced Powder
Diffraction Short Course on the following two days.</p>

<p>The morning session will be completed by a set of five papers
on Novel Materials. The afternoon will then follow up last
summer's workshop on the Rietveld Technique with a series of
papers showing its application in industry. This will encompass
both x-ray and neutron work on a diverse range of materials
showing the versatility of the method.</p>

<h2>Advanced Powder Diffraction short course - Cardiff 1995</h2>

<p>Tutor: Ron Jenkins of JCPDS-ICDD</p>

<p>In association with the BCA Spring Meeting, a two day course
is offered by the Industrial Group of the BCA and JCPDS-ICDD.
Methods of identification and characterisation of crystalline
substances by use of the powder diffraction file will be
covered.</p>

<p>The course will focus on the importance of gathering good
quality data and the use of new computer aided search methods.
The new PC SEARCH INDEX, a DOS program designed to fulfil the
role of a computer readable search manual, and the new PDF
retrieval software for Windows on the IBM-PC with CD-ROM will be
employed.</p>

<p>Hands-on work sessions in the computer centre will build the
proficiency of the user in the interpretation of experimental
powder data with the latest JCPDS-ICDD products.</p>

<p>The course is designed for both beginners and experienced
users of the Powder Diffraction File. It is arranged to begin on
the day after the Industrial Group Sessions at the Spring
Meeting. The commercial exhibition at the Meeting will also
provide an ideal opportunity to meet equipment suppliers.</p>

<p>Attendance at the Course is conditional on registration for
the full Spring Meeting. Apply for a place on the Spring Meeting
Registration Form. A supplementary charge of _40 is payable for
the course. Places are limited.</p>

<h2>Autumn meeting report 1994</h2>

<h2>Real Problems - Real Solutions using X-ray Diffraction</h2>

<p>The autumn meeting was held on 3rd November 1994 at Raychem
Ltd, Swindon. Approximately 40 people were present to hear seven
papers illustrating the versatility of the XRD technique and the
wide range of materials which can be studied.</p>

<p>The delegates were warmly welcomed by Bob Reid who briefly
spoke about the company and the markets which Raychem serve.
Bruce Fox then illustrated how the x-ray facility at Swindon
helps the company to achieve the ever more demanding requirements
of the customer. Bruce showed how a combination of computer aided
goniometer methods and camera techniques have provided the
answers to problems in the field of heat recoverable plastics.
These often involve thin films and extreme examples of preferred
orientation.</p>

<p>Brian Bellamy (AEA Harwell) showed, with examples, how
starting from a request with little or no background information,
XRD can make an extremely useful contribution to, and is often
the key factor in, the solution to a problem. However, a
combination of techniques providing complementary information
were a more powerful tool to the analyst.</p>

<p>Valery Allain (Poitiers) showed how XRD has been used to
determine quantitatively the amount of alumina trihydrate in
polymer cables. This compound conferred fire retardancy on the
cable. The method described (now a quality control procedure) and
the problems that were overcome in achieving success relied
heavily on the uniqueness of the diffraction from this phase.</p>

<p>Malcolm Butler (British Steel) described the problems
experienced in quantifying the amorphous and crystalline
components of ceramic fibre materials used as furnace linings by
the use of XRD methods. The problems included sample preparation,
preparation of standards and determination of peak intensity from
overlapping peaks. Solutions to the problems were described.</p>

<p>Dr. Kinneging (Philips) covered the application of XRD to the
development and quality control of special cements. Particular
attention had to be given to the composition of the raw mix and
the clinker composition in the final product. The high density of
lines in the patterns from some of the constituents introduced
problems in intensity measurement. The solutions found were
described.</p>

<p>After he was presented with the Industrial Group Award, Ian
Ferguson provided a most entertaining lecture on the
characterisation of a single sample of aluminised inconel -
subtitled 'Its a piece of cake'. He drew on his experience to
show again the value of XRD, but demonstrated how the
characterisation of the surface of technologically interesting
materials was often improved by using a combination of
'state-of-the-art' techniques.</p>

<p>The final talk was given by Rod Clapp on behalf of Andrew
Mandile (Australia). In it he described the use of a rapid
routine Rietveld procedure for quantitative analysis in the study
of the organic content of coals, shales etc. Microabsorption
effects were considered a problem but the methodology developed
and described showed how these had been overcome to provide
reliable analyses.</p>

<p>The meeting was both informative and entertaining and thanks
for the organisation of the facilities and the programme go to
Bruce Fox and Derrick Hart and to our hosts Raychem.</p>

<h2>Industrial Group Award</h2>

<p><b>Ian Ferguson</b> was presented with the Industrial Group
Award at the Autumn Meeting last November in recognition of his
sustained contribution to the application of crystallography in
industry. This contribution was well documented in over 80 papers
of which he had been author or co-author.</p>

<p>Ian studied at Southampton and London Universities and then
joined the nuclear industry where he remained all his working
life. His PhD was done while working at Harwell - the topic being
'The derivation of crystallite size and shape from diffraction
line profiles'. He then moved north, spending a few years at
Capenhurst before moving to Springfields.</p>

<p>In the early years of diffractometry, especially when
computers were being used off-line, there was little good quality
software available for augmentation or reduction of data, let
alone data collection. Ian provided a good quality suite of
programs of the type that industrial crystallographers required.
These included FIRESTAR (lattice parameter determination),
FIRECOMET (powder diffraction line intensity) and FAFNIR
(crystallite size and shape). However Ian still believed in the
power of the diffraction camera for certain applications.</p>

<p>He was well known outside UKAEA, not only for his computing
prowess, but also for his ability to solve crystallographic
problems as well as his knowledge of other related analytical
techniques (TEM, SEM, EPMA and latterly SIMS).</p>

<p>His work involved both troubleshooting studies and research
work, giving him a broad base and specialist knowledge of nuclear
related compounds - particularly oxides of the less common metals.
He regularly attended conferences presenting papers, and was
always willing to advise and help others. He retired from active
service at Springfields in 1990 but still retains an interest in
the subject and still attends our meetings.</p>
