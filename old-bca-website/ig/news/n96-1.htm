<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="96-1f1.gif" alt=

<p>The recent Spring Meeting of the BCA, held at Cambridge,
proved to be not only highly successful technically, but also
resulted in a series of changes to the constitution of the BCA
itself (reported in Cr
ystallography News). The success of the
meeting has been, however, overshadowed by the untimely death of
Alun Bowen just a few short weeks after presenting a paper in his
usual exemplary manner. He will be sadly missed. A fuller
obituary will be published in Crystallography News, but a short
appreciation is included below.</p>

<p>The Industrial Group suffered change, our Chairman, Dave
Dyson, relinquished his post, having ably steered the Group to
its present strong position and his report, printe
d below,
details the successes. Dave Taylor has now taken over the reins,
with Steve Norval being elected Vice Chairman, Keith Rogers
elected to the committee and Philip Lake co-opted to provide
expertise on the pharmaceutical side of industry. Both Keith and
Philip were welcomed onto the committee. Jamshad Anwar, elected
ICDD representative for the BCA, has become an ex-officio member
of the Industrial Group.</p>

<p>A very successful IG innovation at the meeting was the course
on crystallography
, run by Jeremy Cockroft, which was well
received by the participants. The technical presentations are
reported below, and the quality and breadth of interest speak for
themselves. There was a slightly better response to the call for
posters, but we still seem to suffer from a lack of interest,
whether industrial pressures these days preclude such exercises,
or that the proprietary nature of the workplace places a
restriction on people's ability to present is not clear. It is
however a pity that thi
s mode of presentation is not more widely
utilised.</p>

<p>Forthcoming events include a Workshop scheduled for late
September on practical X-Ray and neutron reflectivity, and is
aimed at X-Ray Industrial Users who wish to understand and
implement more fully this interesting technique. In early
November the Autumn Meeting will discuss Crystallography in
Industry, and next year will see an early meeting on
pharmaceutical and organic materials, with the Spring Meeting in
Leeds already being planned 
with two themes - diffraction with
simultaneous methods and process and production methods. In
addition, Ron Jenkins will be leading an Instrument Sensitivity
Clinic. Later in the year a non-ambient workshop will be
held.</p>

<p><b>Alun Wynne Lloyd Bowen</b></p>

<p>Alun Bowen died on 7 May 1996 after a long struggle against
cancer. The funeral took place on 15 May. Alun was closely
involved in setting up the BCA and the Industrial Group and had
served as Group Chairman. He will be remembered by
 many of us as
"Dr Texture". A fuller appreciation will appear in due course in
Crystallography News. The Industrial Group has made a donation in
his memory to the Appeal Fund of the Royal Marsden Hospital.
Anyone wishing to be associated with this donation may do so by
sending a contribution to Eric Kelly (payable to BCA-IG) or
direct to the Appeal Fund at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Downs
Road, Sutton, Surrey.</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>I would
 like to thank you for your confidence in me and look
forward to serving you in my term of office helped by an able and
experienced team of committee members. I am grateful to the
retiring chairman David Dyson for his commitment to the
Industrial Group in his seven years on the committee. I am sure
he will still maintain an interest and involvement in our
activities. I also express my thanks Trevor Carter for his work
on the committee over the last four years, especially in
producing our Newsletter,
 and the support over the last year as
he handed over compilation and distribution to Bruce Fox.</p>

<p>In my term of office I would like to see a meeting programme
with enough interest and variety to ensure that every Industrial
practitioner of crystallographic techniques attends at least one
of our meetings. I know that this is a tall order and it cannot
be achieved without your help on two fronts. The first is
ensuring that all industrial practitioners are aware of our
activities. The second is
 making known your views on what topics
should be covered or even volunteering a paper or better still a
poster at one of our meetings.Membership and the Newsletter
distribution are the key to making people aware. You only need to
attend one of our meetings to become a member or renew existing
membership of the BCA.</p>

<p>This Newsletter and Crystallography News are the main means of
advertising our meetings. Crystallography News is only sent to
paid up BCA members. The Industrial group Newslette
r is freely
available to anyone (it is produced and distributed by committee
members without cost). We have already extended our mailing list
with the help of Philips and Siemens and I welcome new readers,
but we must continue to update our list to ensure that we reach
the widest possible audience.</p>

<p>You can help by informing me of changes within your
organisation that mean the right people are not receiving the
Newsletter and by circulating it to relevant colleagues. If you
meet people new 
to the field please spread the word about the
Industrial Group, and put them in contact with Eric Kelly our
secretary.</p>

<p>Contact myself with changes of address or to have your name
removed from the mailing list. The target is to get a copy of our
newsletter onto the desk of every industrial scientist interested
in applications of X-Ray Diffraction and related crystallographic
techniques. Back issues of this Newsletter and Group information
are available on the BCA World Wide Web site
at:-www
.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/index.htm. I hope that you will play
an active part in our group activities.</p>

<p>Let us know your views and tell us the areas you want to see
covered in the programme. Come to at least one of our meetings
each year and your continued membership will be ensured. I hope
to speak with most of you in the next three years but please take
the initiative and give me a call or e-mail your ideas. With your
help I am confident of an interesting and rewarding term of
office.</p>

<h2>BCA Industrial Group on the World Wide Web.</h2>

<p>Surfing the Internet seems to be a somewhat over-hyped
expression these days, but the quantity of information and
relative ease of access would seem to make it a useful
communications and learning tool. In Industry, however, wheels
can turn slowly, due to a mixture of financial constraint and
computer security restraint. The latter seems more important in
terms of s
afeguarding the firm's network, thus although I can
already e-mail people and my company has its own Web page, I
cannot, as yet, directly access the Web. So I took advantage of
Kate Crennell's kind offer to visit the physical site of our Web
page, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratories to learn first-hand
the intricacies of the system.</p>

<p>Kate is the editor of Crystallography News and our Web Master
(Mistress?) who deals with the BCA Home Page which leads, amongst
other things, to the Industr
ial Group pages. You will find copies
of our recent newsletters, the committee details and notice of
forthcoming meetings. The ability to branch out from this
starting point was a revelation, easily culling information on
fibre diffraction, both facilities and software, in a matter of
moments. In discussion with Kate, I suggested that the creation
of a list of consultants and services would be useful for
Industrial users, and this has now been put in place. If you
offer a service, or you can suggest
 or recommend a facility or
resource, please let Kate know.</p>

<h2>X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTION in the PHA
RMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.</h2>

<h3>held at Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, 18th March 1996.</h3>

<p>This meeting was attended by 45 people, mainly industrial
users of powder crystallography in the pharmaceutical industry.
There were also representatives from academia, agrochemicals,
dyestuffs, and forensic science who all have some interest in
relatively small organic molecules as opposed to the inorganic
applications pursued by most of the powder crystallographic
community. In general, organics crystall
ise in large, 'soft' unit
cells of low absorption with diffraction characterised over a
relatively small range of 2 theta (typically ca. 0-55 degrees).
Indexing as a proof of purity and quantitation of polymorphic
mixtures are particularly important issues.</p>

<p>Dr Steve Tarling discussed the power of the technique for
defending patent protection of polymorphs. The cost of XRPD
equipment is insignificant compared to the legal costs of patent
litigation!. The theme was continued by Dr Marek Zakrz
ewski
(Philips,Holland) who discussed the factors influencing the
nature of pharmaceutical products (habit, milling, desired
polymorph). The role of single crystal data, theoretical powder
patterns and molecular modelling was also considered.</p>

<p>Dr Marcus Winter (Siemens) spoke on optimising the
configuration of powder diffractometers for pharmaceutical
applications. Of particular interest was a means of looking at
formulated tablets in-situ.</p>

<p>Dr Jamshed Anwar discussed pressure induc
ed phase changes by
experiment and simulation. These experiments give an insight into
the sensitivity and compressibility of formulated tablets.</p>

<p>The afternoon session started with three short talks by Bob
Lancaster, Sue Staniforth, and Philip Lake (all Glaxo Wellcome).
They discussed the sensitivity of various drug molecules to
relative humidity and temperature.</p>

<p>The final lecture of the day was given by Robin Shirley
(University of Surrey), who demonstrated powder indexing software

and discussed the importance of indexing in the characterisation
of pharmaceutical polymorphs.</p>

<p>There followed a period of open discussion on a variety of
subjects including indexing, calibration, regulatory issues, and
how the instrument manufacturers can be more helpful to a
minority group in the field of XRPD.</p>

<p>The future of a group specialising in organic/pharmaceutical
crystallography was aired. It was generally felt that the day was
an unqualified success and given the respon
se and interest in the
meeting it was agreed that there should be more activity in the
area. It was also agreed that further such meetings should be
held under the auspices of the BCA.</p>

<h2>Quantitative Phase Analysis Using X-Ray Diffraction
Techniques (QXRD Part II)</h2>

<p>QXRD Part II, an Industrial Group Workshop focusing on
accuracy, precision of measurement and the requirements for
accreditation of q
uantitative methods, was held at the Philips
Research Laboratories, Redhill, Surrey on the 14 February 1996.
Quantitative X-Ray Diffraction (QXRD) is perhaps best explained
by Robert Reynolds, Jr: "QXRD contains many pitfalls whose
deleterious effects on the data are not obvious from an
examination of the final results. Precision is easy, but as R.L.
Snyder (a colleague) has remarked, accuracy comes from God". Over
recent years however, major advancements have been achieved with
the aid of improveme
nts in computing technology, that has changed
the current feeling in QXRD. Although, as was re-enforced in QXRD
Part I on 7 June 1995 "User beware", with these advancements in
instrumentation it is easy to believe that precision is in fact
true accuracy and ignores the myriad of factors that make many
laboratories' results so inaccurate. Judging by the 38
participants from 25 laboratories, QXRD is a difficult but
important application of X-Ray diffraction (XRD).</p>

<p>After a warm welcome, the on
e day workshop began in earnest at
10:40 with Judith Shackelton (Philips Analytical X-Ray) giving an
informative introduction and overview into many methods of
quantification. The quantitative methods discussed highlighted
many problems resulting from the nature of the samples
themselves, and the way they affect the approach of workers in
various fields. Judith, advised everyone to check their results
for reproducibility, spread of data and to running test
samples.</p>

<p>Nick Elton (ECC Internat
ional) warned about the errors of
particle statistics. He explained that particle statistics errors
may be significant when low levels of analyte are quantified. The
magnitude of this error also depends on diffractometer geometry
as well as low numbers of analyte. Particle statistics can be
improved by use of wide collimating slits, broad focus X-Ray
tubes and by rocking or spinning the sample. As a rule, it is
best to maximise the number of particles analysed and this can
only be achieved by keepin
g the particles small. However, over
milling can damage the crystal structure so, a compromise often
has to be struck between good particle statistics and errors
associated with line broadening and production of amorphous
material.</p>

<p>Glyn Carter (Geochem Group) explained in detail the Chung
Method of matrix flushing. He began with an introduction into the
work of Frank Chung and went on to use three simple derivations
of the well-established intensity equation for a single hkl
reflection to 
prove that the relationship between integrated
intensity and abundance follows a linear relationship always
passing through the origin. Provided that an internal reference
material can be used to calibrate diffractometer geometry and
sample multiplicity factors, this relationship shows that XRD is
quantitative under ideal conditions. Using this theoretical
relationship, it was demonstrated that by stringent analytical
procedures and the employment of good calibration techniques that
it is possible t
o achieve acceptable and accurate results
experimentally, provided you can obtain a set of pure standard
phases or emulate by mathematical models the diffracting
behaviour of each phase present in the mixture. Glyn also put
forward the suggestion that Rietveld, may help with understanding
this diffracting behaviour.</p>

<p>Don Williams (Sietronics &amp; Siemens) introduced a practical
application of Rietveld to calculate full profile patterns and
intensity scale factors. As a means of matching cal
culated
intensity for each point in a step scan and its difference from
the observed intensity at that point. He went on to explain, that
the refinement of Rietveld scale factors are a function of the
concentration of each phase in a mixture and with the aid of a
computing package you can achieve quite accurate phase
concentrations. I feel that Rietveld may prove to be the only way
to help overcome the may problems associated with correctly
determining true intensity values and Rietveld scale factor
s are
a step forward.</p>

<p>The afternoon session began promptly at 14:30 Walter
Gutteridge (British Cement Association) was the first speaker of
the afternoon session, and maintained a captive audience with his
enthusiastic approach to his talk about practical application of
QXRD within the Cement Industry. After a brief introduction about
the British Standard for Portland Cement. he went through a step
by step approach to its analysis and explained that many of the
problems associated with QXR
D can be overcome with a methodical
analytical method.</p>

<p>Jim Chisholm (Health and Safety Executive) gave a insight into
thin samples - airborne dust on filters. He explained that,
ideally thin samples can be used to determine the mass of a
crystalline phase in any thin polycrystalline film. QXRD is
achieved by the use of a calibration standard matched to the
samples being analysed and the basic principle of the external
standard method. He explained that QXRD gives reasonable
precision and d
etection limits even in an application such as
airborne dusts which take the technique close to its limits; but
accuracy is another question.</p>

<p>David Dyson (British Steel) was the last speaker of the day
and presented an informative talk on the requirements of
quantitative methods for accreditation. He explained that
accreditation provides for a sensible approach to proving the
worth of results. It ensures that all equipment really performs
to an acceptable standard throughout its lifetime. T
he benefits
are three fold: instrumentation is functioning properly, that the
user's training is affirmed and equipment is validated. It
confirms that you are "doing things right" rather than "doing the
right thing". David, gave the closing statement for the meeting
where he commented that QXRD has may problems to overcome but
these meetings have gone a way towards answering many of them. He
suggested another forum to answer many points raised at this
meeting. He reiterated that good basic principle
s are the only
true bases for QXRD: adequately trained staff, traceable
standards, reliable and well-maintained instrument, documentation
and control systems, a professional approach to compliance with
the standard and an understanding of the sample. Results are
worthless unless they quote the level of error or confidence. In
conclusion, QXRD is foreseeable as an industrial tool, however,
more research is needed before the general User can reap its
benefits. Only through the efforts of manufactures 
can this be
achieved.</p>

<p>I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Jo Jutson (BICC
Cables) and Sally Smith (Philips) for their organisational skills
in arranging seven relatively complex talks promptly. I would
also like to thank Philips Research Laboratories for their warm
hospitality.</p>
