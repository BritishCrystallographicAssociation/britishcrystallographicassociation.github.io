<p>26 April, 2002</p>

<p>Industrial crystallographers often develop something of a
blind spot for amorphous materials, even when they are regularly present in
 the
materials routinely handled. We can try to justify a lack of interest by saying
that amorphous phases are not crystalline and therefore not the responsibility
of the crystallographer. The fact is, of course, that X-ray and neutron
scattering can give much useful information about non-crystalline materials but
the techniques of data collection and interpretation take us beyond the
familiar world of high order. The session was chaired by <B>Dave Taylor</B> (ICDD) and
was, of necessity, a very brie
f introduction.</p>

<p><B>John Parker</B> (Sheffield) gave helpful summary of
“Measurement, Interpretation and Case Studies”, relating much of the tutorial
to his interests in glassy materials. The areas covered included: the
principles underlying scattering by randomly and non-randomly spaced atoms;
problems arising from inelastic scattering and other corrections to
experimental data; calculation of the radial distribution function and pair
correlation function; termination and convergence errors;
 the need to use
shorter wavelengths than Cu and the benefits of neutrons; modelling and network
models for glass. An important reason for the decline in laboratory X-ray
scattering studies of amorphous materials lies in the need for short
wavelengths to access nearest neighbour information. It seems that the most
practical options for reliable results (including the alternative approach of
EXAFS) mean starting work at a neutron or synchrotron source. </p>

<p><B>Geoff Mitchell</B> (Reading) address
ed another area with its own
set of problems, “Quantification of Crystalline and Amorphous Fractions”. Much
of the talk was framed around examples from the world of semi-crystalline
polymers, but the principles were applicable elsewhere. In principle,
crystallinity determination should be simply related to the scattering power of
the crystalline and amorphous phases. However, even the definition of
crystallinity is not simple for polymers and really comes down to the
distinction between broad and sha
rp peaks. This was shown to be relatively easy
for some materials such as linear polyethylene at low Q, but increasingly
difficult at higher Q due to huge numbers of closely-spaced reflections. There
are once again practical problems from necessary corrections, including those
for inelastic and parasitic scattering and those for geometry. Issues around
peak fitting are crucial and a range of techniques has been used, some based on
theory that is difficult to put into practice, others on a more pragmat
ic
basis. Establishing the shape of the amorphous component is particularly
difficult. Variable temperature measurements and quenching from the melt have
been used, but it is important to realise that the amorphous scattering curve
can change significantly over a relatively narrow temperature range. Overall,
this was a very helpful introduction for many to an area with hidden pitfalls
and a useful update for those dabbling in the field over the years.</p>

<p>Amorphous materials continue to grow in 
technological
importance (e.g. pharmaceuticals, polymers, electronics, catalysts). Ignoring
them because they are “not crystalline” does seem like burying our heads in the
quartz. I will not be surprised if this topic appears again soon.</p>

<H3>Workshop - Powder Diffraction Surgery</H3>
<p>“Powder diffraction” means different things to different
people. This session was a follow-up from the Rietveld refinement work
shop and
that set the starting point for the discussion.<b> Jeremy Cockcroft</b> was in the chair
and his first task, with a little coaxing, was to assemble a ‘panel’ to field
the questions. <b>John Evans, Robin Shirley, Lachlan Cranswick and Bill David</b>
eventually succumbed and took their places at the front.</p>

<p>The discussion started with the optimum experimental
conditions for ‘H’ positions by neutron diffraction with deuteration. Bill
David advocated medium resolution and huge count rate
s, but it was claimed that
the job could be done better by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The optimum
solution could depend on whether the atomic positions or electron density maps
were sought.</p>

<p>The capabilities of national powder diffraction facilities
and access to them were obviously close to the hearts of many academic
practitioners. The need for both powder and single crystal facilities at
Diamond was keenly felt. The ISIS GEM facility was producing “immense” data
rates, but what do 
you do with a thousand patterns a day? Meanwhile, about one
case in three was getting beam time at most facilities via peer review.</p>

<p>Variable count-rate data collection has long been advocated
for Rietveld studies. This is no problem where users write or influence the
software, but it would require fundamental modifications to the data formats
used by commercial laboratory systems. The best that could be achieved by those
collecting data for Rietveld refinement on such systems was to combine m
ultiple
scans over different ranges or boost high angle count rates with programmable
slits. It was suggested that the more sophisticated data collection strategies
could also help more traditional XRPD applications, such as phase
identification. This might just be the route to galvanising manufacturers into
action. However, there could be a mountain of software rewrites, particularly
to take account of errors with variable count rates.</p>

<p>One thing leads to another, and the lack of publicly
a
vailable software for merging data sets was bemoaned. It was pointed out that
this was the kind of routine that many users would write in a few lines of
code. Sadly, it seems that few scientists are now taught programming, so
spreadsheets might be more realistic for many.</p>

<p>A straw poll showed that Rietveld refinement was being used
in industry, sometimes just for the simpler tasks of lattice parameter
refinement or phase quantification. In these cases there was no need for the
full Rietveld p
rocedures and it was important to choose the parameters for
refinement carefully. This led to discussions of the statistical problems
associated with background removal and the merits of Pawley and Debye fitting
procedures. The applicability of Rietveld to thin films was raised, but there
seem to be problems with line shapes.</p>

<p>The session ended with a few evergreen topics. The Powder
Diffraction File is becoming more sophisticated in its database guise and
expanding enormously with incorporat
ion of patterns from the inorganic and
Cambridge databases. Rather than publish large numbers of full powder patterns,
ICDD was incorporating the ability to simulate patterns for different experimental
configurations. Optimising diffractometer slits for individual experiments is
obviously the right thing to do, unless you work in a laboratory with lots of
hands-on users and the chaos that might ensue. A small side step from this
topic led to the tribulations of variable slits, particularly when they s
tick
in one position. We can all understand the embarrassment of having such
difficulties identified after the data has left the lab!</p>

<p>This was a wide ranging session that took a little time to
get going but eventually got many of the audience involved, covering a range of
relevant topics and producing interesting answers. There is clearly an
important place for regular open discussions of this type, but the huge range
of interests amongst powder diffractionists inevitably results in fewer to
pics
that grab everyone’s attention.</p>

<H3>Workshop - Introduction to Thin Films </H3>
<P> This workshop is one of a series of specialist tutorials, run by the Industrial Group, to introduce new users to different X-ray techniques. Glancing Incidence X-Ray Analysis (GIXA) is used to determine the thickness, density and interface roughness and of one or more layers on samples, which are optically flat. Typical examples ar
e anti-reflective coatings applied to glass and also structures used in the electronics industry, i.e. multi-layers on magnetic disks. When a thin layer, (or layers) are irradiated by an X-ray beam which is incident at a low angle (the scan range is typically, 0 to 3<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#176;</FONT>
 2<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#113;</FONT>
) an interference pattern is produced. The X-rays are reflected from the interfaces, between the various layers and also the interface between the layers and the substrate. 
The interference pattern is a function of the thickness, roughness and density of the layers. This information can be extracted from the pattern by fitting a simulated profile based on estimated, starting values. The method is applicable to layers, which are either crystalline or amorphous. </P>

<B><P> Paul Fewster</B> of Philips Analytical Research started the session off by describing the physics behind the simulation. He described how the properties of thickness, roughness and density influence the sh
ape of the pattern. His talk was very well illustrated with some inventive PowerPoint graphics showing the propagation of the wave front through the layers. Paul expanded his argument to include the determination of in- plane crystallite size and lateral correlation.</P>

<P> <B>Christoph Schug</B>, of IBM Materials Laboratory, Mainz, Germany described the practical considerations for GIXA measurements. Firstly, Christoph described the attributes of the ideal sample, both the substrate and the layers: A f
lat, smooth substrate with an RMS roughness of &lt;10&Aring; which has a sufficient difference in refractive index from the layer(s). For example, use a Ge wafer when studying silicon based layers, as their refractive indices are sufficiently different. The various experimental configurations were then compared and contrasted. Christoph described his favorite, </P>

and provides plenty of 
intensity </LI>
<LI>A beam knife, to limit the irradiated area at such small 28 and <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#119;</FONT>
 angles </LI>
<LI>Copper foil attenuator to protect the detector from the primary beam.</LI></UL>

<P> Next the care needed with sample alignment was emphasized and data collection strategies needed to ensure a good fit to the simulated profile. Christoph then gave tips to ensure an accurate fit between the measured and simulated data. The talk was illustrated with examples, from a simp
le NiO layer sputtered on a silicon substrate, to complex examples of the layers on magnetic media. </P>

<P>Sadly, we didn't really have enough time to do justice to such an extensive and useful technique, which is quite removed from the more common, powder diffraction methods. However, both speakers made an excellent job, providing a stimulating introduction to a fascinating subject. </P>
