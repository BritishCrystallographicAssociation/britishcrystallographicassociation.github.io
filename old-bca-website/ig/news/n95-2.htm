<h2>Editorial</h2>

In this issue we have news of forthcoming meetings, reports on
recent meetings and details of committee changes following the
elections at the AGM. 

<p>Also there is an introduction to a round-robin calibration
exercise in which all members in the UK are invited to
participate.</p>

<p>Following changes by the BCA in the way t
hey allocate funds to
the Groups, detailed in the last newsletter, the committee is
considering various alternatives in attracting Group membership.
A discussion paper is enclosed on a proposal which the committee
is considering. If you have any views on the subject please let
us know.</p>

<h2>JCPDS ADVANCED PHASE IDENTIFICATION COURSE</h2>

<p>The Advanced Phase Identification Course combining lectures
and
 practical sessions was presented by Ron Jenkins, Principal
Scientist of the ICDD.</p>

<p>The interesting and instructive lectures recapped the theory
of XRD, optimum instrument and data collection parameters as well
as the various search strategies available for phase
identification. The lectures were supported by a new phase
identification course workbook which contains a number of
examples to illustrate the various approaches available and
problems which may be encountered in practice. The prac
tical
sessions used computing facilities supplied by Cardiff
University. The large number of course participants allowed for
two users per terminal and this was satisfactory. The facilities
enabled us to try out the latest versions of JCPDS database
software whilst attempting examples from the range of XRD
problems from the workbook.</p>

<p>The course was well presented and accessible to attendees with
a range of experience. The novice users of XRD were able to
follow Ron Jenkins' down to earth a
pproach and the more
experienced benefitted from new tips and looking again at the
basics of the technique.</p>

<h2>QUANTITATIVE PHASE ANALYSIS - part I</h2>

<p>The workshop meeting was held at Sir William Siemens House in
Manchester on 7th June 1995. The sessions were chaired by Jo
Jutson and opened by Gareth Cullen of Siemens who gave a brief
overview of Siemens history and current operati
ons in the UK and
worldwide.</p>

<p>The first paper concerning Sample Methods and Reproducibility
of Data was due to be presented by Walter Gutteridge (British
Cement Association). Due to unavoidable last minute committments
by Walter, the paper was presented by David Dyson who was able to
add some additional detail from his own laboratory to notes
supplied by Walter. Illustrated examples from the BCA laboratory
included extensive data on the effect of sieving and grinding
times during sample pre
paration. Factors such as the difference
between wet and dry grinding were discussed. It was stressed that
the backloading technique was essential for accurate results.
Data on reproducibility of sample preparation was also
presented.</p>

<p>Dieter Bertelmann of Siemens gave a brief overview of methods
available for analysis (Chung I and II, Rietveld). He then
continued by discussing modifications to the diffractometer setup
in order to obtain maximum intensity, i.e. 'tuning your hardware'
to get
 better counting statistics. Removal of secondary
monochromators and soller slits plus the choice of wider slits
can dramatically increase intensity./</p>

<p></p>

<p>Judith Shackleton of Philips gave an in depth presentation
covering aspects of instrument setup and data collection
parameters. In order to achieve the highest possible count rate,
a low background and reasonable resolution, several compromises
have to be addressed. Careful choice of x-ray tube anode and
focus, x-ray detector, filt
ers, monochromators and slits were all
described in order to achieve good peak to background ratios
without producing poor resolution. The importance of regular
machine checks using a standard such as NIST 1976 was stressed.
The paper concluded with a section concerning data collection and
counting statistics. Judith emphasised the importance of counting
for a reasonable time on the background region, especially if the
background is substantial.</p>

<p>Glyn Carter of Geochem presented a paper on t
he effects of
particle size, texture and surface finish. He gave detailed
information on sample preparation techniques to negate such
factors as preferential sorting in mixed phase samples. He
concluded with remarks to the effect that it is possible to
obtain high precision with modern XRD methods, but only poor
accuracy. His final plea was that in most cases there is no set
analytical procedure in the open literature for quantification.
Whereas within one laboratory there may be excellent precision
,
there is often no reproducibility throughout the Industrial
community. He urged us to publish our methods in the open
literature in order to remedy this situation.</p>

<p>Jo Jutson of BICC Cables gave the first of the final two
contributions discussing problems encountered with specific
industrial laboratory samples. In analysing fillers, especially
alumina trihydrate, in cable sheathing, problems exist with lack
of reliable standards and the non ideal shape of the 'as
received' cable samples. 
After investigation suitable standards
were made up by powdering a standard cable, mixing with
spectroblend and pressing to shape. Quantitative analysis of
alumina trihydrate content was successfully accomplished so long
as the polymer type was known and suitable calibration data was
available.</p>

<p>David Dyson of British steel reminded the audience that it was
possible to obtain meaningful results from 'non ideal' samples ,
eg non powder, preferentially orientated steels, typically of
cubic ma
terials with overlapping peaks. Determination of the
amount of austenite in steels is a typical example. Reliable
answers were presented after derivation of 'P factors' along with
a demonstration of software utilised.</p>

<p>The formal part of the workshop was concluded with an open
discussion session.</p>

<p>The workshop was exceptionally well attended with over 60
registered participants. Our thanks are extended to Marcus Winter
and Siemens for the successful hosting of the event at their
off
ices in Manchester. A second workshop on quantitative
analysis, hosted by Philips in February 1996, will expand and
broaden the themes discussed in Part I and include additional
topics such as choice of method.</p>

<h2>BCA MEMBERSHIP</h2>

The Industrial Group Committee are considering a proposal to
offer automatic membership of the BCA to delegates at Industrial
Group meetings. The proposal is aimed at attracting new members
a
nd giving existing members the ability to retain membership by
simply attending one of the IG meetings each year. BCA membership
runs from 1st January to 31st December.

<p>The BCA Spring Meeting would be excluded from the scheme
because of administrative difficulties but, for those who only
attend that meeting, membership could be retained by paying the
additional non-members fee and completing a membership form at
the meeting.</p>

<p>Scheme proposals for all other meetings are as follows:-<br>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing paid-up members attending one or more meetings would
have their membership automatically renewed for the following
year.</li>

<li>For meetings up to 30th September in any year, non-members
attending would be enrolled to the end of that year. New members
who attend two qualifying meetings in their first year would also
have membership renewed for the following year.</li>

<li>For meetings after 30th September, non-members attending
would be enrolled for the following ye
ar but should receive that
December's Crystallography News (with Spring Meeting
information).</li>
</ul>

The scheme would be funded by a small increase in meeting fees.
Any duplication of fees generated by the scheme would be used to
fund Association activities, no refunds would be made. The
proposed scheme would run in parallel with the existing
membership scheme either of which could be used. An option not to
take advantage of automatic membership would be given.
Notification of membership sta
tus would be issued in the normal
way with December Crystallography News.

<p>The current methods of payment of the 81 BCA members with IG
as main interest are as follows:-<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>11 via Royal Society of Chemistry</li>

<li>17 via Institute of Physics</li>

<li>27 by Standing Order</li>

<li>18 by Cheque</li>

<li>7 by non-member additional Spring Meeting fee</li>

<li>1 by term payment</li>
</ul>

The committee is still debating the details of the scheme. Any
comments or s
uggestions should be sent to Dave Taylor (address on
front cover).

<h2>ROUND-ROBIN</h2>

<h2>DIFFRACTOMETER CALIBRATION</h2>

<pre>
     -  -  Is your diffractometer correctly aligned  -  -
     -  -  Is it accurate  -  -
</pre>

The group is proposing to organise a 'round-robin' exercise to
enable members resident in the UK to check their diffractometers.
This will follow along the lines of similar exercises o
rganised
in several countries over the last few years by Ron Jenkins and
the ICDD. The exercise will require each participant to make
measurements on the internationally available NIST standard
reference material SRM1976. This is a plate of sintered alumina
which can be made with very reproducible properties.

<p>Plans are not yet complete and we may either purchase a number
of standards and circulate these to all participants or we may
encourage each participant to purchase their own standards. Th
e
first option ensures that everyone measures the same sample
whilst the second would be a lot quicker.</p>

<p>If you are interested in participating please let us know. The
form below shows the preliminary information we need. Please
either post, fax or e-mail the information to the address
given.,p&gt; David Taylor will be giving an introductory talk on
the Round-Robin at the Autumn Meeting.</p>
