<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p> Welcome to the Industrial Group Newsletter You will find in its pages plenty of information concerning forthcoming meetings and a report of our Autumn meeting held last year. 

<p>As always, the BCA Spring Meeting is an important meeting and one in which the Industrial Group is particularly active with the organising of both XRD and XRF sessions. Take a look at pages 3 to 5 for general information about the XRD and XRF sessions at this meeting. More information about the contents of each session can be seen on the Industrial Group's web pages.
</p>
<p>Its going to be a busy year for the Industrial Group with not only the BCA Spring meeting to deal with but also a Residual Stress Meeting, two Special Interest Group meetings - one on Small Angle Scattering and one on Pharmaceuticals as well as the 2007 Autumn meeting. 
</p>
<p>Industrial Crystallography is certainly alive and kicking even though the number of crystallographers working in industry has been declining in recent years. 'Industry' appears to be getting much more involved with University departments and it is from these departments in which 'Industrial Crystallography' is increasingly carried out.
</p>
<p>Thus, if you are working on Industrial applications in academia then make yourselves known to the BCA Industrial Group. Through the Group you will have an opportunity to broaden your knowledge of Industrial Crystallography, tell others what you are doing to broaden their knowledge and, hopefully, make good contacts and perhaps some friends (we are not all that bad!).
</p>
<p>The Industrial Group's AGM will be held at the Spring Meeting. Here's your chance to suggest ideas for the development of the Group. Do you have a 'complaint'. Don't be quiet - make it known.
</p>
<p>Finally, as some of you will know, the Industrial Group's Chairman, Jeremy Cockcroft will be stepping down as Chairman at the AGM. On behalf of our Committee and the membership I'd like to thank Jeremy for the leadership he has shown and the good council he has brought to the committee.
<br>Best wishes Jeremy.

</p>
<p><strong>XRF Paper on the analysis of paper</strong><br>

Those of you who are RSC members may have seen in the January issue of Chemistry World (page 24) a note about a forthcoming
paper by Luisa Carvalho in Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, dealing with the XRF characterization of papers.
<a class = "emph" href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/JA/article.asp?doi=b608361g">(http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/JA/article.asp?doi=b608361g)</a>
At our Spring Meeting, Luisa will be speaking on much the same topic - Wednesday afternoon at 1330.
</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter and Web Site Content</strong><br>

We continually try to improve the content of both the Newsletter and web pages and would like to ask you to submit articles etc.
Do you use web sites for your day to day work in XRD and XRF? If yes, then which sites do you visit, let us know and send us a paragraph about what you use the site for and why you like it.  
</p>
<p>Do you have any <strong>hints and tips </strong>to share with the rest of the membership? They could be on anything relevant to XRD and XRF covering areas such as sample preparation, calibration, measurement strategies, results handling, time saving measures. Let us know.  To start the ball rolling on this I'd like to comment on the preparation of a sample of powder for analysis. I grind small amounts of refractory material using a pestle and mortar and place the material into an aluminium sample holder using the 'side-fill' method (to reduce the effects of preferred orientation). The sample holder has to be mounted vertically on the instrument so how do I stop the powder falling out of the holder? Well, I spray a smidgin of WD40 onto the sample surface to help bind the powder together. It works and the small amount of organic in the surface doesn't have any significant effect on the diffractograms obtained. I've heard that hairspray can also be used - I prefer to keep WD40 in my cupboard!

<p>That's it for now. Enjoy your Newsletter.

<p><strong>Industrial Group E-mail Mailing lists -
Online registration.</strong><br>
We now maintain separate lists for XRF and XRD mailings so please register for BOTH if you want to be kept totally in the picture. The IG sends about six E-mail notices each year to anyone interested (You don't even need to be a BCA member!). These inform of Newsletter postings and the various meetings we organise each year. You can now register for our E-mail lists online - follow the link from the IG home page. There is an opportunity to be removed from the list with each mailing.

<p><strong>The BCA Industrial Group will be 25 years old in 2008 - How should we celebrate this anniversary?</strong></p>

<p><i>Reprinted from Crystallography News No 1 June 1982</i></p>
<p><big><i>Formation of the Industrial Group of the BCA</i></big></p>

<p><i>The recent "Durham Crystallographic Meeting" will always be associated with the highly successful launch of the BCA.   Detailed reports on this meeting will, no doubt, be prominent in this issue of Crystallography News.   It was particularly gratifying, however, for the organizers of the Industrial Symposium to note that of the 175 delegates, approximately 50 were from Industrial or Applied Research Institutions, a response unprecedented in recent years. Furthermore, from discussions with participants it was apparent that the papers and numerous posters presented during the Symposium aroused significant and genuine interest.   It was perhaps, not surprising therefore that the announcement by Council of its intention to form an Industrial Group was received with enthusiasm by the delegates.
</i></p>
<p><i>In broad terms the aim of this new Group will be to promote the development, introduction and exploitation of crystallographic techniques and concepts in an Industrial or Applied context.   It is envisaged that this will be accomplished primarily by providing an interdisciplinary forum and an improved dialogue between the Industrial and Academic sectors.
</i></p>
<p><i>A four man Working Party comprising John Harding (British Rail, Derby), Glen Smith (BP Research Centre, Sunbury) and Colin Dineen and Brian Isherwood (Hirst Research Centre, Wembley) is at present attempting to formulate the Constitution and Rules of the new Group.   The aim is to submit a draft document for consideration by Council at their next meeting, scheduled for July. However, the Group cannot be formally constituted until the next AGM of the BCA, which will be held during the Spring 1983 meeting at Royal Holloway College.   Before then it will be necessary to circulate all potential Group members with the proposed constitution and to solicit nominations for Officers and Committee Members.   Hopefully, this will be done during November-December. If you know of any colleagues who are not members of the BCA, then get them to join now so that they can be added to our circulation list.
</i></p>
<p><i>If  Durham is regarded as the prototype, then we can look forward to some stimulating productions and a lively Group.
</i><br>
