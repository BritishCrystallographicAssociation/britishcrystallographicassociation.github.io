<h2>Cover Photograph - Flat Plate Camera in Action</h2>

<h2>Camera Techniques - The overlooked Tools!</h2>

<p><img src="98T1f1.gif" alt="camera image"></p>

<p>A flat plate photograph showing a wealth of information
obtained quickly and simply.</p>

<p> The specimen is a thin plastic sample consisting of two main
inorganic fillers in a polymer 
matrix, together with a variety of
other minor additives. The two fillers each have two polymorphs
and the polymer is semi-crystalline, resulting in five
crystalline phases present. There are, inevitably, overlapping
peaks, and one of the inorganic polymorphs has a needle-like
habit. As a result of processing, the polymer crystallites orient
on three axes and the needle like inorganic polymorph conforms to
these orientations. A single flat plate photograph allows for the
phase identification of the 
four polymorphs with a surprising
degree of accuracy; a description of the fibre orientation of the
polymer and needle-like polymorph; and a qualitative estimate of
the crystallite sizes of the various phases. Time: 1 hour
exposure, 10 minutes development, 30minutes measurement and data
reduction. This is just one of several invaluable camera
techniques we have set up, which are ideal for screening quite
complex materials in a simple and rapid way.</p>

<h2>Two dimensional plate methods, should they be more widely
used?</h2>

<p>Diffractometer based, computer controlled, digital collection
of polycrystalline diffraction data is accepted as the industrial
norm, a rapid and cost effective analysis tool. In fact, many
younger practitioners in industry have never even seen, let alone
analysed plate, Debye Scherrer or equivalent films.
Frustratingly, automated phase identification routines of
diffractometer based
 diffraction traces sometimes produce what
the analyst considers to be 'spurious' identifications, when
considering other information available (e.g. origin, chemistry,
physical properties). These conundrums generally occur when the
specimen is of very fine particle size, has coarse grains, is
strained or has preferred orientation, (as either the diffraction
peak's shape, position or intensity are modulated).</p>

<p> Whilst all these phenomena can be investigated by specialist
techniques, requirin
g dedicated software and / or hardware, the
overview approach of looking at the characteristics of the Debye
ring is frequently ignored. Why? Because plate film or film
cameras are not now a standard set up in mainly industrial
laboratories, (they are not High Tech!) Yet, as shown above,
films can provide a rapid structural information overview and
pointers to the selection of the most appropriate specialist
technique for a particular problem. Further, 'spurious' automated
phase identifications can 
easily be proved and explained. A
summary of the information available from the intensity features
of a Debye ring is provided below.</p>

to enhance the cost effectiveness of your resource!</p>

<h2>Help - Sample Holders</h2>

<p>When did you last buy new s
ample holders? This question is
particularly relevant to Bruker AXS (formerly Siemens) D500 kit
with an automatic sample changer unit, for which I have first
hand experience, but may also be of relevance for your
diffraction equipment too.</p>

<p>As with most of the diffraction community we religiously
measure instrumental standards at least weekly to check sample
alignment errors, tube intensity etc. These results were telling
us that there was no long term change in anything except the
expected
 decline in tube intensity.</p>

<p>Results on experimental samples however were suggesting
otherwise. At first we thought peak shifting from literature
positions was perhaps a feature or function of our synthesised
high surface area catalysts or from added or adventitious
dopants. However when pure high temperature calcined
(experimental) standards gave unusually large lattice parameters
we needed a more practical explanation.</p>

<p>Of course with hindsight its easy to solve. Throw your old
sa
mple holders away and buy some more. Years of use and
subsequent cleaning had lead to a wearing away of minute amounts
of the plastic material of the sample holder totally destroying
sample alignment. And worryingly at the time we had no way to
monitor this as all our instrumental standards are mounted
(fixed) in sample holders that never received the same
degradation from day to day handling treatments as our routine
sample holders.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The 3 R's - Rietveld R values discussed</h2>

<p>The Rietveld method has become a well-established technique of
analysis for powder diffraction data. Least squares minimisation
(refinement) of the difference between observed data and that
calculated from a model structure is used to produce estimates of
variables such as lattice parameters, preferred orientation and
atomic co-ordinates. Assessment of the fit between the calculated
and observed data is most often throug
h calculation of
&lsquo;R-values&rsquo;. The precise meaning of these R-values and
their use and abuse has resulted in some recent debate.</p>

<p> Perhaps the 3 most frequently used R-values are :</p>

<dl>
<dt>R<sub>B</sub> :</dt>

<dd><em>R-Bragg</em> is produced from the Bragg intensities
calculated from the structural model and those estimated from the
observed data. Hence, this R-value does not truly reflect the fit
to the actual observed data points but is closely related to the
conventi
onal R-values from single crystal refinements where a
&lsquo;good&rsquo; refinement produces R<sub>B</sub>'s of &lt;
5%.</dd>

<dt>R<sub>wp</sub> :</dt>

<dd><em>R-weighted pattern</em> is calculated from the
differences between each individual point of the observed and
calculated powder diffraction patterns. (If weights are 1.0 then
R<sub>p</sub> is calculated). It is perhaps the most meaningful
R-value and is a good indicator of the progress of the
refinements. However, even when the structural
 model is good,
small anomalies in the observed data (e.g. peaks from a trace
second phase) can significantly inflate R<sub>wp</sub> values.
Further, small values of R<sub>wp</sub> can be produced from a
poor structural model by fitting low resolution data or data that
is not sensitive to structural parameters. Values of
R<sub>wp</sub> reported for refined structures are often in the
range 5 - 15 %.</dd>

<dt>R<sub>e</sub>:</dt>

<dd><em>R-expected</em> may be thought of as a
&lsquo;theoretical'
 minimum R-value that can be achieved with the
observed data and structural model variables. Thus, unlike the
other R-values, its numerical value does not change during the
course of a single refinement. The ratio,
R<sub>wp</sub>/R<sub>e</sub> is frequently used as a
&lsquo;goodness-of-fit&rsquo; indicator (sometimes c), which
reflects an adequate refinement when its value is 1.0 to 1.3. For
values &gt;1.3 the structural model should be reconsidered and
for values &lt;1.0 the quality of the data sho
uld be
examined.</dd>
</dl>

<p> Recent debate has concerned the effect that the background
intensity distribution has upon the Rietveld refinements. Most
workers refine some background function as part of the
minimisation process. However, Hugo Rietveld&rsquo;s original
work was based upon observed data which had been background
subtracted. Thus there is a distinction between
<i>conventional</i> R-values (without background) and the more
frequently quoted, <i>total</i> R-values (including
backg
round).</p>

<p> Whichever R-values are most appropriate, there can be no
substitute for an intelligent inspection of the calculated and
observed patterns, and close examination of the final structural
model parameters (and their errors) to ensure that they are
sensible.</p>
