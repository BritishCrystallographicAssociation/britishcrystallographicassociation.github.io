<h2>January 2008 Newsletter.</h2>
<a name="Chair"></a> 
<h2>Chair's Message</h2>
<p>The latter half of 2007 was a productive one for the IG
Committee: we held two very-well attended meetings, and have been
busy planning our programs for the Spring Meeting in April AND
two meetings on minerals in May. November 2007 saw back-to-back
meetings of the Pharmaceutical Special Interest Group and the
Autumn Industrial Group; we were fortunate not only to have the
use AstraZeneca's conference facilities, but also to receive
financial sponsorship from them.</p>
<p>In April we will have several sessions at the Spring Meeting,
then meetings on minerals in May, and finally we hope to have a
joint Autumn meeting with the Young Crystallographers. Details of
all these meetings are on the website. Some of these events still
have spaces free for speakers, and I hope some of you will
consider contributing talks.</p>
<p>I would like to invite your input into the planning of future
meetings: suggestions on topics, speakers, meeting format and
venue would all be welcome. I'd also like to point out that you
don't need to be on the Committee to get involved with
organising&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; any volunteers?</p>
<p>Finally, I'd just like to thank Roy Copley, who is standing
down from the IG Committee at the end of his term of office, in
April. Roy has been a major contributor to the success of the IG
meetings, and represented us on the program committee of the
Spring Meeting, with great effect.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to you all.</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this edition of the BCA Industrial Group's Newsletter. It contains 
details of the Industrial Group's XRD sessions at this years BCA Spring Meeting 
which will be held at the University of York. You will also find reports for the 
Pharmaceutical Special Interest Group Meeting and the Industrial Group Autumn 
Meeting which were both held at AstraZeneca, Macclesfield in November.
I would like to remind you that unedited versions of all the reports covered in 
this Newsletter can be found on the group's web site.</p>
<p>The IG Committee have been discussing the Group's constitution. Rather than 
making changes for changes sake the focus has been to improve the constitution 
so that it more closely reflects what actually happens in the running of the Group. 
The proposed changes are shown on page 10 and will be voted on at the Group AGM 
which will be held during the BCA Spring Meeting (see below for details)
</p>
<p><b>Newsletter and Web Site Content</b></p>

<p>We continually try to improve the content of both the Newsletter and web 
pages and would like to ask you to submit articles etc.
Do you use web sites for your day to day work in XRD and XRF? If yes, then 
which sites do you visit, let us know and send us a paragraph about what you 
use the site for and why you like it.</p>
<p>That's it for now. Enjoy your Newsletter.

<h2>Proposed Changes to BCA IG Constitution</h2>
<p><b>These changes will be proposed at the AGM on 9th April 2008
at the York Spring Meeting.</b></p>
<p>Additions are <u>underlined</u>; deletions are <s>struck
through</s>; comments are in <i>italics</i>.</p>
<p>10 OFFICERS. The Officers of the Group shall be a Chairman, a
Vice-Chairman, <s>and</s> an Honorary Secretary (who shall also
act as Honorary Treasurer) <u>and an Honorary Assistant
Secretary/Treasurer</u>. Only members of the Group shall be
eligible to be officers of the Group.</p>
<p><i>When changes to the Group Officers occur, problems and
delays are experienced in issuing cheques, this is especially the
case if two officers retire at the same AGM. The problem is
exacerbated by the increased security measures now involved in
changing bank signatories. The Honorary Secretary/Treasurer has
the highest workload of all the Group Officers. The committee
propose a new office of Honorary Assistant Secretary/Treasurer to
overcome both these problems. It will increase to FOUR the number
of cheque signatories (any two from four) and relieve some of the
Honorary Secretary/Treasurer's workload. The committee will
oversee the division of duties between the Honorary
Secretary/Treasurer and Honorary Assistant Secretary/Treasurer to
best suit the needs of the Group and the individuals. The new
assistant position is seen as a training role for future office
as Honorary Secretary/Treasurer.</i></p>
<p>12 PERIOD OF OFFICE FOR OFFICERS AND COMMITTEE. Each Officer
and Ordinary Member of the Committee shall retire after a maximum
of three years service. No officer or Ordinary Member of the
Committee shall be eligible for re-election to the same office
until one year has elapsed since his or her retirement. <u>In
this section a year's service is deemed to be the period between
successive AGM's.</u></p>
<p><i>There is a need to make clear that the period of office of
committee members is not governed by calendar years, but the
period between successive AGM's. The proposed change gives
clarification of this issue.</i></p>
<p>13 CO-OPTION TO THE COMMITTEE. The Committee shall have power
to co-opt to fill casual vacancies in compliance with Rule 11. In
addition it may co-opt such other members not exceeding
<s>two</s> <u>three</u> in number as may be required from time to
time, without the restrictions contained in Rules 11 and 12.</p>
<p><i>Experience has shown that only permitting two coopted
members can lead to inadequate flexibility, so it is proposed to
increase to three the number permitted.</i></p>
<p><u>16 DELEGATION.<br>
(a) The Committee may delegate any of their powers or functions
to a subcommittee consisting of two or more Committee members,
one as chair, and a small number of nominated experts. The terms
of reference of any such delegated subcommittee must be recorded
in the minutes.<br>
(b) No expenditure may be incurred on behalf of the Industrial
Group except in accordance with a budget previously agreed by the
Committee.<br>
(c) The Committee may revoke or alter a delegation.<br>
(d) All acts and proceedings of any subcommittees must be
reported to the Committee.</u></p>
<p><i>It has become clear with the experience gained in bringing
XRF into the Group that some of the work of the Industrial Group
Committee is best handled by smaller sub-committees. A new
addition to the constitution on delegation sets forth what we
have found to work well for XRF and opens up the possibility of
the delegation of other tasks in the future. Rules 16-20 would
become 17 - 21.</i></p>
