<h2>Useful Camera Techniques - the Wallace-Ward (Marconi) thin
film camera</h2>

<p>I know of at least two other users of this excellent camera,
and we are agreed as to its simplicity and utility in examining
not only thin films but also sample bulk properties. Orientation,
crystallite size, phase identification, sequencing of layers are
all possible. It provides a useful screening tool before applying
more instrumented techniques since, as with most camera
techniques, it allows for a comprehensive qualitative view of the
crystalline state.</p>

<p><img src="98t2f1.gif" alt="camera diagram"></p>

<p>The diagram shows the layout of this cylindrical camera, and
the position (L) of the observed reflection is related to the
camera radius and wavelength only <sup>(1&amp;2)</sup>.</p>

<p>The rotating sample is presented to the X-ray beam at a
selected angle of incidence and thin films or surface phases are
enhanced by the low(30&deg;) incident angle. A disadvantage is
the lack of a fiducial mark on the film, but this is easily
overcome by either identifying a known reflection and referencing
the other lines to this, or by using the cut-off position of the
X-ray shadow, or by use of Keith Roger's Texcam program
(below).</p>

<p>Orientation and crystallite size effects are immediately
apparent from the film and detail differences at the extremities
of the diffraction lines may be used to deduce the sequence of
thin layers present. Single crystal substrates offer excellent
samples and epitaxial growth problems have been studied.</p>

<p>Mary Vickers has offered the example of cold rolled nickel,
which has a complex texture, picture below.</p>

<p><img src="98t2f2.jpg" alt="film image - Cold Rolled"></p>

<p>Suitable heat treatment converts the texture to "cubic" with
the three axes of the cube aligned to the rolling, transverse and
sheet normal. This form is of considerable academic and
industrial interest, picture below:</p>

<p><img src="98t2f3.jpg" alt="film image - Heat treated"></p>

<p>Keith Rogers has written an excellent PC program (Texcam)
which simulates the expected pattern, complete with orientation
and intensity effects. Applying this to the nickel problem, one
obtains:</p>

<p><img src="98t2f4.gif" alt="simulation image"></p>

<p>Presenting anything other than a simple pattern in this
newsletter is difficult, but it can be seen how much information
is gained from a single experiment with a minimum of effort and
at low cost. For those with a Weissenberg camera lurking in the
cupboard, Judith Milledge has told me that it can be rejigged to
perform a similar function as the Marconi camera. A. L. Mackay
has also adapted a similar camera for measuring preferred
orientation in wires <sup>(3)</sup>.</p>

<h2>A guide to Self testing your diffractometer</h2>
<p>Please check out an improved version of the SpreadSheet in a <a class ="emph" href="http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/bca/ig/admin/news5.htm">News Report</a>. </p>
<p>A more detailed version of this guide is available as a <a href="../dloads/RRstgd.PDF">92kb .PDF file</a></p>
<p>An Intensity Round Robin was completed in the UK in 1997. It
covered Philips and Siemens (now Bruker) diffractometers and
generated a useful resource for the evaluation of instrument
performance. To make this data widely available so that anyone
could test their own machine a series of self test files were
produced. This guide explains how to use these files to run the
tests in your own laboratory.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment required:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A diffractometer to test.</li>

<li>A NIST SRM 1976 alumina plate standard to fit the
instrument.</li>

<li>A computer running Word 6 or later, Excel 5 or later.</li>

<li>The ability to obtain files by ftp (and unzip them) or e-mail
capable of receiving attached .doc and .xls files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self test files:</h2>
<p>The files you need can be downloaded from the following list.</p>
<pre>
    File          Size     Use

  <a href="../dloads/Readme.txt">README.TXT </a>     3 kb    explains tests
  <a href="../dloads/RRint.PDF">RRint.PDF</a>     225 kb    UK Round Robin report
  <a href="../dloads/RROBCUTP.xls">RROBCUTP.XLS</a>  153 kb    Cu tube Data Template
  <a href="../dloads/RROBCOTP.XLS">RROBCOTP.XLS</a>  152 kb    Co tube Data Template
  <a href="../dloads/Ukdemo.xls">UKDEMO.XLS</a>    154 kb    A completed data example

</pre>


<p><strong>Running the tests</strong></p>

<p>Print a copy of RRint.PDF, the UK Round Robin report.<br>
Follow the instructions in Appendix 1 of the report to run the
tests. If time is limited then at least run test 1c and test
8.</p>

<p><strong>Comparing Results.<br>
</strong> Your results can be compared with those in the UK
report. The intensity plot from Test 8 should not show any
pattern and no point should deviate above 1.0785 or below 0.9215
if your instrument is in control. In the FOM plot the higher the
score the better. The value of the dead time can only be used as
a guide and if doubted should be measured with improved counting
statistics.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions.</strong><br>
A method to test the intensity of a diffractometer has been
described. It is based on the UK tests in an International Round
Robin Exercise. It has been established in the belief that
allowing users to test their own systems will help them identify
and correct potential sources of error in their data.<br>
