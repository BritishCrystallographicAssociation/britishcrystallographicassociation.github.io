<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. Things have
been relatively quiet since the BCA Spring Meeting in Nottingham.
By all accounts, it was a very successful event, although there
is some concern over the relativ
ely small number of industrial
delegates. Problems such as the Easter holiday and the difficulty
in taking a week off work were highlighted. With this in mind,
changes have been made to next year&rsquo;s meeting (see details
in this newsletter), which should hopefully encourage more IG
members to attend.</p>

<p>There are a number of forthcoming meetings, so please make a
note in your diary. As always I would welcome any contributions
from members. In particular articles about meetings attended,
r
ecent developments in your field and book reviews. Please also
consider becoming a member of the committee. It&rsquo;s a chance
to influence the running of the Industrial Group and
doesn&rsquo;t take up too much of your time.</p>

<p>Finally, we were all saddened by the recent death of Ron
Jenkins. He will be sadly missed.</p>

<h2>Ron Jenkins 1932 - 2002</h2>

<p><img alt="Photograph of Ron Jenkins
(7K)" src="Jenkins.jpg"
height="273" width="193" align="left"> Dr Ron Jenkins, born 10th
April 1932 died peacefully at his home in Downingtown
Pennsylvania on 19th June 2002. He was one of the great pioneers,
teachers and leaders in the field of X-ray analysis, well known
and highly respected in materials science circles around the
world. A devout Christian and devoted family man he is survived
by his wife of 47 years Phyllis, five children and five
grandchildren.</p>

<p>Ron was born in Oxford an
d awarded a scholarship to the City
of Oxford High School. He studied Physics and Metallurgy at the
University of London, Chemistry at the Oxford Polytechnic
Institute (ONC, HNC, LRSC) and was awarded his PhD (Chem. Phys.)
at the Polytechnic Institute of New York.</p>

<p>Ron started his career as an Analytical Chemist at Esso
Research in Abingdon in 1953. At this time he served two years
national service as a meteorologist in the RAF. In 1962 he became
manager of the X-ray applications Laboratory 
for Philips Research
and Control Instruments in London. In 1967 he moved to Philips in
Eindhoven to head the X-ray Applications Laboratory and in 1971
to Philips Electronic Instruments in Mahwah New Jersey as
Principal Scientist. He took up the post of Principal Scientist
with ICDD in 1986 becoming Executive Director in 1996 and serving
as Corporate Secretary and member of the Board of Directors. His
ceaseless efforts saw the introduction of CD-Rom Technology, the
growth of membership and massive ex
pansion of the PDF file.</p>

<p>The X-ray community has lost one of its leaders but
Ron&rsquo;s legacy of teaching x-ray science will live on. It is
estimated that 5000 students attended his workshops around the
world. Many will fondly remember his BCA workshops in Leeds,
Cardiff, UMIST and Daresbury, especially those fortunate to
receive one of his textbooks and have it personally signed. He
wrote 10 textbooks and contributed 11 book chapters on x-ray
methods, presented over 200 scientific papers
 on the subject and
prepared two audiovisual courses for the American Chemical
Society.</p>

<p>His technical achievements were recognised by the scientific
community and he received many awards and honours including: Gold
Medallist, Society for Applied Spectroscopy 1982; Birks Award in
X-ray Spectrometry 1986; Barrett Award in X-ray Diffraction 1993;
Jenkins Award for Lifetime achievements in X-ray Analysis 2002.
He is the only person to receive both the Birks and Barrett
awards. Ron&rsquo;s abil
ity to tell a good story was suitably
rewarded by easily winning a light hearted after dinner
competition at the 1998 Denver Conference. As chairman of its
organising committee since 1981 the Denver Conference owes much
to Ron for his unstinting and dedicated work.</p>

<p>In addition to his technical achievements, Dr. Jenkins was a
member of STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Project) and lectured
over 50 times to about 6000 people regarding the artefact. His
book "Closing the Gap between Science and
 Religion" outlines his
dedication to the Christian faith. He was most recently a member
of the Church of the Nazarene, where he served as Council member,
Choir Director, Vocal Soloist and Sunday School teacher. He was
also a trustee of the Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy,
Massachusetts for many years. His love of music was expressed as
a vocal soloist and playing the trombone in a local brass
ensemble. Denver Conference attendees will doubtless remember his
participation in post-banquet entertai
nment, as a member of the
&ldquo;Powdermen&rdquo; Barbershop Quartet!</p>

<p>Ron was a compassionate man with a charismatic sense of humour
who brought leadership and enthusiasm to all aspects of his life.
A celebration of Life Service was held at the West Chester Church
of the Nazarene, Pennsylvania on the 22 June. He will be lovingly
remembered by many people around the world who were touched by
his life.</p>

<h2>Industrial Group Survey</h2>

<p>A recent survey was conducted regarding the topics for future
Industrial Group meetings. Thanks to all those who sent in
replies and to Brett Cooper for collating the results. The survey
involved giving each topic a score of 0 &ndash; 9, with 9 being
of most interest. The top ten topics with their mean score is
shown in the table below:</p>

<p>The Industrial Group committee has noted these results and
will be trying to ensure that these topics are covered in
forthcoming meetings, (see information for the Autumn and Spring
meetings elsewhere in this newsletter). In the meantime, if there
are any other topics you would like 
to see discussed at a future
IG meeting, please send your ideas to Phil Holdway (Hon Sec) or
any member of the Committee. <a name="ixas"></a></p>

<h2>International X-ray Analysis Society (IXAS) - update.</h2>

<p>The first full IXAS membership election has taken place and
Prof. Paolo Scardi of the University of Trento has become
President&ndash;Elect. George Havrilla is now the IXAS President
with Bob Snyder remaining on the Council for one more year as the
Past President.</p>

<p>The fou
nding sponsors are about to be joined by the rest of
the X-ray Analysis community and the equipment pages should see
rapid expansion. For more details of an e-society aimed at the
