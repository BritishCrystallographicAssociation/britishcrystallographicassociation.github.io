<h2>DARTS - a new service for Industry</h2>

<p>CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory's new service for Industry, DARTS,
was successfully launched at an event held at the laboratory on
May 20th. Over thirty representatives of Industry from all over
the UK attended, to hear presentations about the capabilities of
Daresbury
's unique Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS). DARTS
offers Industry quick, cost effective and user-friendly access to
the benefits offered by Synchrotron Radiation (SR). Through its
flexible structure, Industrial customers need not become users of
the SRS, merely users of DARTS, as DARTS staff will perform the
necessary SR work in consultation with the customer.</p>

<p>Powder Diffraction and its related reflectivity and energy
dispersive methods, are among the techniques offered by the
service, as
 is single crystal diffraction using Daresbury's new
small crystals facility. Use of SR, with its tunable wavelength,
high intensity and low beam divergence (meaning high resolution
in the powder pattern), offers measurable benefits over
conventionally collected data for applications such as indexing,
difficult QPA tasks, stress and strain, and structure
determination. Non-ambient temperatures are also available, from
cryogenic to elevated temperatures and for certain kinds of
experiments, non-ambie
nt pressures also. The flexible,
consultative approach of DARTS means that customers can tap into
the depth of expertise available at Daresbury, if required, for
experimental design and data processing.</p>

<p>After three full months operation, the number of customers is
already well into double figures.</p>

<h2>5th European Powder Diffraction Meeting at Parma
(EPDIC-5)</h2>

<p>In late May I found myself in Parma, northern Italy, in the
select company of two or three hundred powder diffractionists
from around Europe. The venue, weather, entertainments, food and
wine were all very enjoyable - the conference was pretty good
too. I was just a little disappointed to find how select was the
UK industrial represe
ntation. For most of the meeting I thought
there were only two of us, but my estimate had doubled before the
close.</p>

<p>It has to be admitted that industrial crystallographers were
in pretty short supply from any country. During a 'round table on
powder diffraction in industry' it quickly became apparent how
fortunate we are to have both the BCA and an Industrial Group
within it. Academics in other countries are still wondering how
to involve the industrial community.</p>

<p>All this might s
uggest a heavy academic bias to the
conference. In terms of the participants that was certainly true,
but the subject matter was much closer to home. Judge for
yourself from the list of sessions: disordered structures,
accuracy, catalysts, in situ studies, materials, HT-HP studies,
structure solution (X2), instruments/methods (X2), quantitative
analysis, kinetic studies, size-strain / stress, databases /
software, texture analysis, structure refinement, inorganics /
organics, thin films. I found mos
t presentations stimulating and
many very relevant. The list of speakers was impressive with many
from USA and beyond in addition to Europeans who would quickly be
placed in the "world leader" class.</p>

<p>There were many excellent posters presented by scientists
delighted to have an interest taken by industrial colleagues. The
commercial exhibition was inevitably much more comprehensive than
anything you are likely to see in the UK apart from the 1999 IUCr
Congress. Many manufacturers' experts w
ere immediately to hand
for discussion.</p>

<p>EPDIC-4 at Chester in 1995 was an excellent meeting, attended
by many from the Industrial Group, which led me to expect more of
us to turn up at Parma. EPDIC-6 is to be in Budapest during
August 22-25 1998 with an expanded range of topics. You could do
worse than fit it into a summer holiday. Far be it from me to
suggest that you will find anything to beat our magnificent BCA
meetings (especially the IG bits). But if you can make it I would
commend E
PDIC-6 to you on the basis of numbers 4 and 5. I hope to
see you there.</p>

<h2>Reference Standards for Routine Diffractometer Checks</h2>

<p>Mention of diffraction reference standards always seems to
provoke interest and it is obvious that the materials supplied by
NIST only go part way to meeting the average lab's needs. Several
people have asked for details of the samples we use at Wilton.
Here is the basic
 information (with apologies to those expecting
an earlier reply from me).</p>

<p><img src="97T2f1.gif" alt="fig 1 mounting diagram"></p>

<p>We occasionally use most of the NIST Standard Reference
Materials for XRD including, most recently, SRM 1976 alumina
plate for the BCA round robin. These all have their place, but
for routine checks we need samples that do not have to be remade
before each use. That would be not only time-consuming, but
introduce a set of reproducibility problems.</p>

<p
>To maximise the value of each measurement, we use lanthanum
hexaboride (SRM 660) embedded in resin as our main standard
(figure 1). A paste of SRM660 is mixed with low viscosity epoxy
resin (as used for embedding microscopy samples). This is
back-loaded into a suitable xrd sample holder with its reference
surface held firmly against a glass plate (level!) coated with a
very thin layer of release agent. Warming the epoxy while setting
speeds up the process and helps the LaB<sub>6</sub> to sediment
o
ut to the reference surface. This layer is kept pretty thin (0.5
mm is plenty) to economise on SRM660 and a thicker backing layer
of straight epoxy resin added to give stability.</p>

<p>When fully set, the glass is removed and the surface cleaned.
You may find the finish quite adequate for your needs as it is.
If your diffractometer positions the sample directly from the
holder surface, the entire surface can be machined to an
appropriate tolerance (ideally &lt;10um). Alternatively, a
standard/res
in block could be produced and machined without the
sample holder, then glued into position. This avoids machining
the sample holder surface e.g. for D5000 instruments where the
sample surface is at a fixed height above the machine reference
surface. (Take care in machining SRM660 - LaB<sub>6</sub> is
toxic!)</p>

<p>Why use lanthanum hexaboride? It is primarily intended as a
standard for measuring the instrument peak shape in relation to
line profile analysis. It is also has a certificated lattice

parameter (cubic) which means that peak positions can be checked.
One standard therefore allows simultaneous measurement of peak
area (to monitor tube intensity), peak position (to check 2 theta
alignment) and peak width (dependent on tube focus and theta
alignment). Full scans are useful occasionally for a thorough
check.</p>

<p>Analysing one or two peaks at least weekly for area, position
and width should give confidence in your instrument performance
and help spot developing problems.</p>


<p>For those who need a lower angle alignment check (&lt;20 &deg;
2 theta for CuKa), the options are limited, especially if you
need a traceable standard (NIST is usually the nearest thing). A
silver behenate standard is being prepared by NIST that should
help, but the currently available material is a mica, SRM675.
This SRM has been criticised, but if properly handled it works
well. The trick is to use a very small amount of the mica
platelets aligned against a flat surface (figure 2), rather than

try to prepare a bulk sample.</p>

<p><img src="97T2f2.gif" alt="fig 2 sample mount"></p>

<p>A single drop of dilute alcohol suspension of the mica dried
onto a polished low background holder should give at least six
measurable orders of the mica basal spacing (lowest peak at about
8&deg; 2 Theta ). A certificated spacing is provided but you can
also check the goniometer alignment by the relative positions of
the various (00<em>l</em>) peaks.</p>

<h2>Intensity Round Robin Update</h2>

<p>The UK intensity round robin has now been completed. It forms
part of an exercise started in the US by Ron Jenkins and since
run in several countries around the world. A total of 33
instruments were tested in the UK and some interesting
observations can be made. The results showed some disparity with
the US data (lower overall intensity) which is being further
investigated. The intensity data for Cobalt tubes is
 different
than that for copper and these discrepancies are being
investigated by Ron Jenkins.</p>

<p><strong>Important conclusions.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Many instrument configurations were involved but a typical
configuration for both Philips and Siemens equipment was
apparent.</li>

<li>The results have set a benchmark against which the
performance of any instrument can be gauged.</li>

<li>All new instruments should be certified against the benchmark
by the manufacturer as part of the c
ommissioning process.</li>

<li>Instrument manufacturers and diffraction users should
incorporate some of the tests into routine instrument performance
checks.</li>

<li>The easiest way to increase intensity is to remove the
Secondary Soller Slit. This doubles the countrate with only a
small resolution and background penalty.</li>

<li>The most common problem was angular displacement. Make sure
you regularly check your instrument is calibrated and do it at
both low and high angles.</li>
</ul>


<p>What next?</p>

<p>I will be presenting the results at the Philips meeting at
Durham in September and we hope to get some comments and feedback
from the manufactures in the next newsletter. The UK Report in
Word 6.0 format and the Excel 5.0 spreadsheets needed to run the
Round Robin are being made available so that anyone with a NIST
SRM 1976 standard can run the tests for themselves. These are
currently out on test and are available from the BCA web site
<em>in draft form</em> or on floppy di
sc from the Industrial
Group.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to collaborate and submit data and / or use
and comment upon downloading the files, please contact me, and I
will be only too willing to advise, comment, receive
brick-bats!</p>

<h2>European Standards and X-Ray Powder Diffraction</h2>

<p>The non-destructive testing technical committee of the
European Committee for Standardization 
(CEN/TC 138) has formed an
Ad Hoc Group to propose written standards for x-ray powder
diffraction. The official title for this activity is "X-ray
Diffraction from polycrystalline and amorphous materials" and Dr
Giovanni Berti of the University of Pisa is leading the ad hoc
group.</p>

<p>I attended a meeting of the group on 25 May in Parma during
EPDIC-5 as the newly appointed UK representative, nominated by
BCA and BSI. The project is now well under-way and official UK
participation is, sadly, ab
out two years behind the main action
being led by the Italy, France, Germany and Holland.</p>

<p>The agreed scope of the project now reads: <strong><em>"To
write Standards, stating general principles, and defining
terminology, procedures, reference materials and instrumentation,
to be applied in the X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline and
amorphous materials".</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Five 'work items' have been defined and are being
progressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>XRPD Terminology</li>

<li>XRP
D General Principles</li>

<li>XRPD Procedures</li>

<li>XRPD Samples</li>

<li>XRPD Instrumentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is unclear just how far reaching an influence these
standards will have, but we must assume that they will affect
most powder diffraction practitioners, particularly in industry.
Specifications for product testing and supporting data for
patents are obvious examples of areas that could require
adherence to European standards for laboratory measurements.</p>

<p>There has al
ready been extensive discussion within some
national groups. It would be impossible to catch up with this
activity in the UK before the deadline for the first set of draft
standards, due for submission to CEN/TC 138 this autumn. Such
deadlines apparently wait for no one and failure to deliver on
time would most likely result in abandonment of the project. Some
modifications (expected to be 'minor') can be made at this point.
However, the technical committee will then send copies of
proposed standard
s to the national standards bodies (BSI in the
UK) when there will be a longer period available for
discussion.</p>

<p>The next meeting of the ad hoc group is scheduled for 30
September in Paris and I expect to be there. The most recent
versions of the 'work items 'mentioned above are due to arrive
shortly. When these come I hope to gather comments from a wider
section of the UK powder diffraction community than have so far
been involved.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to these discussi
ons, please
contact me as soon as possible so that I can distribute copies of
the relevant documents. At this stage I propose to proceed
electronically where possible. It may then be desirable to have a
meeting of interested parties later in the year.</p>
