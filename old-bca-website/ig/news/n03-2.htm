<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. It's been a
relatively quiet summer for the Industrial Group after the
excellent Spring Meeting at York. I'm sure that those of you who
were able to attend the meeting enjoyed the lectures, posters and
all the other events. The format was slightly different to
previous years with everything crammed into three days. This made
it a busy time for delegates moving between the various parallel
sessions. Due to work commitments, I was able to take advantage
of the new one-day registration and thoroughly enjoyed my brief
visit on the Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Industrial Group has also decided to change the usual
format of the Autumn meeting to a two day meeting at Birkbeck
College, London. With both joint and parallel sessions, it
promises to be an excellent follow up to the event held near
Coventry in 1999. The facilities are excellent and there are
plenty of hotels in the immediate area. It also offers the chance
for delegates to extend their stay into the weekend with an
opportunity to experience the many attractions London has to
offer. Please make a note of the dates in your diary NOW.</p>
<p><b>Would you like to describe your typical working day or your
X-ray diffraction career?</b></p>
<p>This is your chance!!!</p>
<p>I am always looking for new ideas for articles to go in the
newsletter. Two ideas I would like to think about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interview with an industrial crystallographer.</li>
<li>A day in the life type article.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first would involve answering a series of questions
talking about your career in xrd such as earliest recollections
and experiences, changes in xrd since you first started, and any
humorous anecdotes. Finally perhaps a question on your thoughts
about the future.</p>
<p>The second would involve a description of a typical day at the
office/lab. I know that this might not be easy but most people do
follow some kind of routine.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts and please feel free to put
forward any other suggestions for newsletter features.</p>
<p>Please contact any member of the Industrial Group Committee
(see back page for contact details) with any suggestions for
future meetings, offers of presentations, offers of hosting a
meeting and nominations for the Committee or the group award.</p>
<p><b>Articles Wanted:</b></p>
<p>Why not put pen to paper and write a short article for our
next Newsletter. There are lots of examples to give you some
ideas in our Hints &amp; Tips section on the WEB. Don't forget, if
you attend a conference, please send in an article about it.</p>
<p>We are also looking to expand the range of Industrial
Applications of XRD on our WEB Site.</p>
<p>All we need are a few well chosen pictures and a few words.
How about something on CEMENTS, MINERALS, MUSEUMS, PHOTOGRAPHY,
DETERGENTS, PIGMENTS, POLYMERS</p>

<h3>European XRPD Standards Published</h3>


<p>For the last few years I have been reporting to the UK powder diffraction community in various ways about the (slow) progress in writing standards for XRPD. It may come as a surprise to those who thought it would never happen, but the first two documents have now been published. In UK, they have British Standard numbers, i.e. 'BS' in front of the European numbers. The published standards are:
</p>
<h5>BS EN 13925-1:2003</h5>

	<p>Non-destructive testing. X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline and amorphous materials. General principles.
</p>
<h5>BS EN 13925-2:2003</h5>

	<p>Non-destructive testing. X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline and amorphous materials. Procedures.
</p>
<p>The standards are not cheap to buy, particularly at full price, but your organisation may have less costly access to them. You can find more information on the BSI standards website: <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Corporate/Standards.xalter"target=
"resource window">http://www.bsi-global.com/Corporate/Standards.xalter</a>. One interesting feature of the 'Procedures' document is the set of equations for basic diffractometry calculations. You will find most of these elsewhere, but this set is unique (I think) in that units are provided.
</p>
<p>The following instalment on 'Instruments' should be published within the next year. An interesting aspect of this standard is the framework provided for describing and specifying diffractometers. Further instalments on 'Reference Materials' and 'Terminology' should appear soon after. Work is also in progress towards a standard on Residual Stress.
</p>
<p>Thanks again to all those who have contributed to writing the documents, and with anticipation to those who will contribute to the remaining parts.

<h3>1st Annual Biomaterials Workshop</h3>
<p>Shrivenham 17th March 2003</p>
<p>This Biomaterials Workshop was hosted by Cranfield University
(Shrivenham campus) and held on 17th March 2003. It was the
inaugural launch of a series of such meetings designed
particularly to introduce new researchers to more established
workers in the field and present new &amp; emerging areas. The
meeting attracted more than 80 delegates from as far away
Barcelona and Belgium.</p>
<p>Delegates were welcomed to the workshop by the head of the
sponsoring University department, Professor Cliff Friend and the
president of the ABW council, Susan Etok.</p>
<p>The first presentation of the initial morning session was
delivered by Professor Peter Marquis (University of Birmingham)
who comprehensively described conventional and new material
systems for use as dental restorative materials. He convinced
everyone that finding alternatives to metallic amalgams is a high
technology challenge and described the potential benefits of
newly developed nano-particulates as they can provide the
material quality and aesthetics required. The subsequent paper,
delivered by Professor Andrew Lloyd (University of Brighton),
presented an intriguing method for enhancing osteointegration
through exploitation of part of the natural mineralisation
process. In particular the role of calcium-binding phospholipids
within matrix vesicles was described and Professor Lloyd showed
how such lipids could, in vitro, self assemble into 3-D gels that
may provide a suitable environment for rapid calcification.</p>
<p>Different fabrication routes to produce apatite coatings were
expertly discussed by Dr David Grant (University of Nottingham).
In particular, coatings formed by plasma spraying and laser
ablation were compared with respect to their chemistry, surface
topography and cell interaction. Dr Grant emphasised the need to
apply absorption corrections in diffraction measurements of
crystallinity and pointed out the lack of any ASTM methodology in
this respect. Subsequently, Dr Jonathon Knowles provided a
persuasive description of the use of phosphate based glasses as
biomaterials, and explained how the solubility of such materials
can be significantly modified through the addition of Na or Ca
ions. Dr Knowles explained that these glasses are relatively
soluble in contrast to the bioglasses traditionally employed as
biomaterials. He went on to show that, by annealing the glasses
to crystallization, the subsequent phase mix can be employed to
determine the amorphous structure. One use of such glasses is as
3-D fibre network structures to support cell growth systems. The
final presentation of the morning session was provided by Dr
Peter Wilshaw (University of Oxford) who described an elegant and
novel approach to formation of a strongly adherent bioactive
coating based upon a nanoporous alumina ceramic. Dr Wilshaw
explained that the advantage of this technology is that pore
diameter can be easily controlled and that these pores are
typically ~0.2 micrometres, which is significantly lower than
conventional porous materials used for biomaterial applications.
Very low dissolution rates in culture media &amp; osteoblasts were
reported (0.03% in 10 days) and the rate of Al release is also
apparently very small. Cell interaction with these surfaces was
illustrated and the potential for loading the pores with
bioactive materials discussed.</p>
<p>Following lunch, delegates had the luxury of being able to
'mix and match' between 3, carefully orchestrated parallel
sessions. The talks were diverse, from an industry perspective of
plasma sprayed coatings (Robert Scott, Biomet-Merck) to bone
fragility &amp; its causes (Peter Zioupos, Cranfield University) and
an introduction to the medical devices faraday partnership (Faye
Smith, MDFP).</p>
<p>The final 2 formal presentations of the day were from
Professors Joe Franks and Jim Elliott. Professor Franks (Brunel
University) described a room temperature fabrication route for
the formation of diamond like carbon coatings with high substrate
adherence. These were described as being hard and flexible and
good for preventing thrombus formation. Finally, Professor
Elliott (Queen Mary), who has been described as one of the most
notable pioneers in apatite structural chemistry, carefully
described the key ionic packing arrangement of the apatite
lattice and pointed out that most of the space is occupied by
phosphate ions packed into a pseudo-HCP arrangement. He went on
to illustrate several ionic substitution possibilities and, in
particular, carbonate substitution into phosphate and hydroxyl
sites. He finished by indicating that apatites can still produce
surprising results and described how his recent work has shown
evidence of formate substitutions.</p>
<p>Overall, the day offered a broad and diverse programme that
reflected the range of interests of the biomaterials community.
All the lectures were of high quality and well received by all
the delegates. A lunchtime poster session (best poster award
going to J. Blaker, Imperial College for Silver doped bioactive
glass coated sutures for tissue engineering and wound healing
applications), and a cake cutting ceremony also served to
'entertain' the delegates.</p>
<p>The success of this first workshop was due principally to its
professional organisation and delegate &amp; speaker enthusiasm.
There is no doubt that these workshops will continue to provide a
high quality forum for encouraging collaborations and promoting
awareness &amp; understanding in the field. Further details of the
next workshop will be announced in due course at
www.cranfield-biomaterials.com.</p>

<h3>Bruker - AXS Ltd User Group Meeting</h3>
<p>Yew Lodge Hotel, Kegworth,<br>
12th - 13th May 2003</p>
<p>About 40 delegates were present, probably slightly down on
previous meetings. A reflection perhaps of hard times; at least
for industrial users. After gathering at lunchtime, the meeting
began with a series of presentations by users.</p>
<p>First up was Darren Derbyshire (Aventis) who spoke on XRPD
Method for the quantification of Anhydrous API in a Monohydrate
API/Anhydrous API/Carrier Mixture. Darren explained that existing
methods were not accurate enough due to the presence of Lactose.
His method involved removing the lactose, which then allowed
improved observation of the anhydrous peak. Using peak areas
anhydrous levels as low as 1% could now be determined.</p>
<p>Louise Male (University of Bath) spoke about Structure
Solution of Large Organometallic compounds from Powder XRD Data.
Louise spoke about Pt containing compounds whose optoelectric
properties were affected by intermolecular interactions. She
explained the method of structural solution, which involved a
series of steps starting with indexing of powder patterns through
to Rietveld refinement. Both lab x-ray and synchrotron radiation
were used and her results were very encouraging.</p>
<p>Judith Shackleton (University of Manchester Materials Science
Centre), spoke on Lots of Stress in the Materials Science centre.
Judith spoke about the measurement of residual stresses using
x-rays at Manchester using a 2-dimensional detector. Judith
explained why there is a need to measure these stresses in
engineering components; in particular to improve our
understanding of premature failure through fatigue. Judith
mentioned other techniques, which can be used to measure RS such
as hole drilling, magnetic methods and sectioning. She talked
about the various advantages and disadvantages of the different
methods and explained the use of the 2-D detector. Judith
finished with some examples such as very large castings and
railway lines where portable methods are very useful.</p>
<p>The morning session ended with a talk by Duncan Gregory
concerned with Powder Diffraction of Air Sensitve Materials. He
described a cell, which had been built to look at materials that
are hydroscopic and air sensitive. Ba2N, Ca2N and SrTiN2 were
examples of compounds investigated.</p>
<p>After a coffee break, David Beveridge (Ilford) spoke about
Applications of X-ray Diffraction in the Imaging Industry. David
began by explaining that despite the rapid rise in digital
photography, silver halide work will remain important for
sometime to come. He then went on to explain the wide range of
samples investigated using x-ray diffraction from various types
of inks and media (eg paper) work on pigments many of which do
not have patterns in the diffraction database.</p>
<p>Mary Vickers (University of Cambridge) spoke on Is
Reflectometry Useful? Mary explained relectometry and the type of
information it can give, particularly in the case of multilayered
materials. She showed some typical data for InGaN/GaN and
explained how the information could be extracted and the
importance of modelling. The final part of her presentation dealt
with instrumentation; in particular the need for accurate
alignment.</p>
<p>Anne Kavanagh (AstraZeneca) was next up speaking on using Xrpd
to Detect Crystalline in Amorphous Drug. She explained that
amorphous drugs work better because they are more soluble in
water. Over time amorphous form will crystallise. This will be
affected by storage conditions. Anne showed that one way around
this was to form a solid dispersion in a polymer. She went on to
show some examples and typical data collected and how modifying
this enabled limits of detection down to 1% to be obtained.</p>
<p>The final talk of the day was given by Gordon Barr,
(University of Glasgow), on SNAP 1D Pattern Matching and
Polymorph Hunting. The program deals with quantitative and
semi-quantitative determination of unknowns and deals with
factors such as Peak shift and overlap, texture and poor data
quality. He then showed an example of quantitative analysis (the
BCA IG round robin samples) where he achieved the best results.
Finally, the program can be used analyse other x-y data (eg. IR).
Delegates then had dinner followed by a get-together in the bar,
where everyone had an enjoyable time.</p>
<p>The last session on Tuesday morning involved a number of
presentations by Bruker concerning new developments. These
included a humidity and temperature system and high temperature
chambers. Chris Cowden spoke about compliance issues and the
morning ended with a presentation on Combinatorial Screening.
After another excellent lunch, everyone departed. Thanks to
Bruker AXS for a very useful meeting.</p>
