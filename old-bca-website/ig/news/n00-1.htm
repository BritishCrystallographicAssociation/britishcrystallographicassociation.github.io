<h3>Help Needed.</h3>

<p>That was a busy summer, wasn't it? As you will see from this
issue there have been a tremendous number of very well attended
mee
tings over the summer and autumn period. They all had a high
quality technical content and, hopefully, were enjoyed by many
crystallographers. However behind the actual meetings there is a
lot of effort put in by many people, often in their own time, to
get the meeting, venue and speakers organized and in the right
place at the right time. The willing time and effort put in by
volunteers behind the scenes is thus vital to the success of
meetings like these. This is particularly true of the Industrial

Group who are loosing 5 of the committee at the AGM (see inside)
as their terms of office have expired. The committee therefore
needs your help. If you feel that you could spare some time and
are willing to help run the IG and its meeting please come
forward. The task is not very onerous and new people always bring
in new ideas which keeps everyone else on their toes. The
Industrial Group Committee needs some new volunteers, NOW! Also
thanks to all who wrote up the reports for this issue and best

wishes to everyone for the Xmas and 'special' New Year break.</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>It would seem appropriate at the start of a new millennium to
be thinking about doing lots of new things. Being the Industrial
Group, we already seem to have done most of them over the past
year. The Forum a
t Coventry was well-attended and well-received.
Our main difficulty now is to find a way of building on that
success without compromising other activities, but the committee
is working on it. The Glasgow Congress was a great success for
most of those who attended, but sadly incompatible with the
circumstances of many industrial crystallographers. However, it
was good to have a representative selection of industrial
crystallography on the IG display (now on the web site) and Dave
Taylor was elected t
o the BCA Council at the AGM. We finished our
old millennium activities with a rather different Autumn Meeting
at Birkbeck College. This took the form of a hands-on workshop
looking at some of the computing resources available to us over
the internet and by other means. We intend to incorporate the
"hands-on" approach into next year's events. Many thanks to all
those who have made 1999 such a successful year and given so much
of their time and energy. You will find items on what's to come
in 2000 el
sewhere in the Newsletter. The format for the year's
events may look familiar, but there is novelty built into the
individual sessions. As an example, I would encourage you to have
a go at one or more of the samples available for the Specimen
Preparation Workshop at the Spring meeting. Prepare them and
measure the data in the comfort of your own lab, then get
properly into the fray as we compare approaches and prejudices at
Herriot Watt (confidentiality assured unless you spill the beans
yourself or
 give someone else permission so to do). Keep watching
the web site as I am sure you will continue to find new things
there of real interest to you. I have just heard that Jo Jutson
plans to retire at the end of 1999. Sadly, that also means she
will be stepping down from the role of vice-chair. We will
greatly miss the many contributions that we have enjoyed from her
over the years, but I am sure you would all like to join me in
wishing Jo a very long and happy retirement. A very happy
Christmas and
 prosperous New Year to you all. I look forward to
growing a little wiser with you and enjoying your company at our
meetings next year.</p>

<h2>THE 16TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING</h2>

<h2>of the Industrial Group of the British Crystallographic
Association</h2>

<p>will be held at the:</p>

<p>BCA Spring Meeting, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, on 4th
April 2000.</p>

<p>Nominations are sought for Vice-Chair and 5 Committ
ee Members
to serve for three years from April 2000.</p>

<p>Nominations, which shall be proposed by not less than two
members of the Group and shall be accompanied by the written
consent of the nominee, shall be sent to reach the Honorary
Secretary of the Group not later than seven days before the
Annual General Meeting.</p>

<p>The name and address of the Secretary is:</p>

<h2>Newsletter Mailing list.</h2>

<p>It is important that the Industrial Group maintains an up to
date mailing list.</p>

<p>Please let Dave Taylor (address in list of officers) know if
you change address, if there is a more appropriate contact in
your organisation or you no longer require a paper copy.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is now posted on our WEB site:
(http://bca.cryst.ac.uk/BCA/IG/ig.html). We have back issues in
place from 1995. Why not have a browse and let me know what you

think. Almost 100 members are now being informed by e-mail when
each new edition is mounted helping us to save costs.</p>

<p>We hope to extend this method in future especially to our
overseas members who incur high postal charges. If you are
prepared to switch from a paper copy (and help save the trees) to
e-mail notification of the WEB posting, then send an e-mail
to:<br>
Dave Taylor <a href=
"mailto:djtaylor@lineone.net">djtaylor@lineone.net</a> - with the
title WEB NEWS.</p>
