<h2>January 2008 Newsletter.</h2>
<a name="Chair"></a> 
<h2>Chair's Message</h2>
<p>I'd like to start this Newsletter by welcoming new committee
members, Matt Johnson and Brett Cooper, and to John Kaniuka who
acts as a link between the Industrial Group and the Young
Crystallographers.</p>
<p>Matt and Brett have really dived-in, and are organising this
year's Autumn Industrial Group meeting, along with local
organiser, Tal Austin. We are now in the throes of organising our
part of the Spring 2009 meeting, and I'd like to encourage you
all to consider offering to speak in one of our sessions.</p>
<p>On behalf of the IG committee I'd like to extend a big
THANKYOU to our sponsors. Space does not permit them all to be
listed here, but their names and logos can be found on our web
site. The support we receive is really important to our
activities and enables us to run meetings with very low delegate
charges.</p>
<p>The organisers of the May meetings on 'Minerals &amp; much
more!' took our tradition of low charges one step further by
offering free places to students, thanks to generous sponsorship
and the free use of the facilities of the British Geological
Society. As always, the organisers, Martin Gill (XRD) and the XRF
committee, came up with a great programs for the two days and
'much more' included a wine tasting, so that delegates could
fully appreciate the impact of geology on viniculture. Another
reason for all those happy smiley faces in the photos.</p>
<p>I'd also like to thank Rigaku for sponsoring this edition of
the Industrial Group's Newsletter.</p>
<p>To conclude these remarks: many thanks to all those involved
with this year's meetings, and I hope you have a great
summer.</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this edition of the BCA Industrial Group's
Newsletter. It contains edited versions of Industrial Group
reports for the BCA Spring 2008 meeting at the University of York
and for the two-day Industrial Group meeting which was held at
the British Geological Survey, Nottingham. Thank you to all those
who attended these meetings and particularly to those who took
time out from their busy lives to write-up the various reports.
Due to space limitations, the reports have been edited down.</p>
<p>I would like to remind you that unedited versions of all the
reports can be found on the Group's web site:</p>
<p>Just follow the web links from the Electronic Newsletter for
the full reports. The edited versions are on the PDF Newsletter
download.</p>
<p>Our attention now turns to the Industrial Group's Autumn
meeting. This will be a Pharmaceutical Special Interest Group
meeting on the 5th November 2008 at AstraZeneca, Loughborough.
The programme is coming together (see page 11) and there is now a
Call for Papers. Contact the session Chairs for more
information.</p>
<p>The programme for next years BCA Spring Meeting at
Loughborough University is also being finalised. A flavour of the
programme is also given on page 11. Please visit the Industrial
Group's web-site for more information and updates as we get
nearer to the event.</p>
<p><b>Newsletter and Web Site Content</b></p>
<p>We continually try to improve the content of both the
Newsletter and web pages and would like to ask you to submit
articles etc. Do you use web sites for your day to day work in
XRD and XRF? If yes, then which sites do you visit, let us know
and send us a paragraph about what you use the site for and why
you like it.</p>
<p>That's it for now.<br>
Enjoy your Newsletter.</p>
