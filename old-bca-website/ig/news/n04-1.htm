<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. There are
lots of meeting reports in this issue. I hope you'll find
something useful from them. The recent Forum II meeting was a
great success. Those of you unable to get to Birkbeck missed two
days of excellent presentations backed up by local organization.
Thanks must go to Jeremy Cockcroft and Dave Taylor. As you can
see, there are more meetings coming up. This year's Spring
Meeting in Manchester is again of a similar format to last years.
The industrial group is responsible for some aspects of the
programme. Please have a look at the details in this newsletter
and try to come along. As with last year, one-day registrations
are available. We are also planning two meetings in June, the
first is designed to help newcomers to x-ray diffraction and the
second is another in the series of Pharmaceutical SIG's which
have been a great success. Finally, we have our usual Autumn
meeting which this year is on DIY Crystallography. As always at
this time I ask for volunteers to join the committee. This year
we are again looking for new recruits. Please do think seriously
about offering your services. It doesn't take up much time and is
something useful to put on your CV!. Finally, a big thank you to
all those who have written articles for this newsletter. Hope to
see as many of you as possible during this year.</p>
<p>Why not put pen to paper and write a short article for our
next Newsletter. There are lots of examples to give you some
ideas in our Hints &amp; Tips section on the WEB. Don't forget,
if you attend a conference, please send in an article about
it.</p>
<p>We are also looking to expand the range of Industrial
Applications of XRD on our WEB Site.</p>
<p>All we need are a few well chosen pictures and a few words.
How about something on CEMENTS, MINERALS, MUSEUMS, PHOTOGRAPHY,
DETERGENTS, PIGMENTS, POLYMERS</p>

<h3>2003 Denver Conference Report</h3>
<p>This was to be my first Denver conference and I had been
looking forward to it for some time. My initial concerns over BA
flight delays were not realised as I just missed the chaos at
Heathrow caused by the August industrial action. My flight was
naturally late and overbooked which resulted in an agreeable
upgrade to club class. This provided a lot more leg room and a
free refreshment/moisturiser pack good enough to use as a 'gift
from the US' for my wife! I had sent a 'graduate' student on
ahead to ensure her presence at Monday evenings poster
presentation. I arrived just in time to mingle at this first
poster session but the free drinks (provided at all poster
sessions) and time difference ensured my early retirement.
Unfortunately this also ensured my 4.00am awakening on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The conference was held at a large conference centre (the
'Denver Tech Centre') that provided the convenience of hotel and
conference facilities at same location. However, it was not
within walking distance of anywhere, with downtown Denver some
miles away.</p>
<p>The principal conference theme focused upon XRD and XRF of art
and archaeological objects. Typical parallel conference sessions
from Wednesday to Friday were supported by workshops on the
previous 2 days. These included discussions of X-ray optics,
Rietveld applications, specimen preparation, alignment, and 2-D
diffraction.</p>
<p>I took some time on Tuesday morning to talk to several of the
commercial exhibitors, (the commercial exhibition was extensive)
which included finally meeting the U.S. part of the Bruker
operation.</p>
<p>The workshops of particular interest to me concerned intensity
distribution measurements using an area detector. Presentations
were delivered from both Bruker and Rigaku representatives and
there was some debate (not surprising) that centered upon the
advantages and disadvantages of wire vs. image plates and curved
vs. flat field detectors. Speeds of data collection were also
discussed. I had hoped that these, and the other workshops I
attended, would have perhaps involved more audience participation
and interaction.</p>
<p>The Plenary sessions on Wednesday morning focussed upon the
analysis of art and archaeological objects. The four principal
speakers, who all gave fascinating and enlightening talks, were
from Belgium, Austria, Canada &amp; the U.K. Initially each
explained why the analysis of such objects is important for
culturo-historical, conservation/restoration, and assessment of
authenticity. State-of-the-art XRD and XRF were employed to
examine objects as diverse as Frescoes from Jordan, enamels,
stone axes, corrosion products and even Napoleon Bonapartes'
signature. We were shown how micro-XRD had successfully even been
used to map layers through the cross-sections of small paint
flakes. The Wednesday afternoon parallel sessions addressed
instrumentation, Rietveld applications, high-resolution
diffraction and synchrotron applications. I attended the "new
instrumentation" session, which consisted of presentations by
technical staff from Industries, rather than their sales
representatives. These included descriptions of quality assurance
processes for miniature X-ray tubes (up to 10W from a 3-4cm
tube!), new multilayer optics which, when placed in incident and
diffracted beams (twin mirrors) are capable of depth profiling,
and a new motorised knife edge system for combinatorial
screening.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday afternoon, I took advantage of being in
Denver to meet with an old friend and industrial collaborator
(another disillusioned U.K. academic who had recently left for
the 'greener pastures' of Denver). This also allowed us to tour
the bars of downtown Denver. We enjoyed the sunshine, free buses,
excellent customer service and the architecture of the railway
station. We did not enjoy the major roadworks that seem
ubiquitous in Denver. Nicknamed, "T-Rex", these are apparently
due to take 5-6 years to complete!</p>
<p>Thursday consisted of more of parallel sessions. Before lunch
these included detectors &amp; sources, synchrotron applications,
stress analysis and TXRF, and after lunch, optics, stress
analysis, industrial applications and quantitative XRF. Thursday
was also the day I was due to deliver 2 talks and take a night
flight back to the U.K. I chose to attend the synchrotron session
in the morning. This was a diverse set of talks included
stress-crack analysis studies of magnetic nanostructures, phases
of Ni-Si and texture studies using high energy X-rays. For me, a
most intriguing presentation was provided by Professor Stuart
Stock (Northwestern University) who showed, using phase
radiography, how a newt would regenerate limbs, which
surprisingly is not from the top downwards. Unfortunately, my
talk in this session seemed to be better than the fire alarm at
clearing the lecture room of an audience&hellip; surprising as it
was the only talk of the conference to show the inside of a
working gentleman's "washroom" !</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon I attended the "industrial applications"
session. Presentations included examples of industrial problems
investigated by Herbert Goebel (e.g. inclusions within uPVC
window frames, glancing angle applications), a description of new
funding sources for hydrogen storage systems (e.g. clathrates)
and a review of the research facilities at GE. This was delivered
by Yan Gao who said, in comparing industry with academia, that
"industry sought solutions whereas academia sought problems".
Other lectures included descriptions of a novel simultaneous
n-IR/XRD system, and an innovative diffractometer designed for
very rapid determination of texture in coated tapes (1 pole
figure per minute).</p>
<p>I left Denver on Thursday evening feeling tired (it had been a
long and very full programme) but convinced that the trip had
been worthwhile. Overall the conference was very well organised
and had provided an interesting and diverse range of lectures.
All of the talks were of high quality. Lasting memories will
include the spectacular pancake breakfasts (spectacular in terms
of quantity and cost), and the thorough search of my shoes at the
airport. I look forward to attending another Denver conference in
future when I have saved up enough money.</p>
