<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. After a
relatively quiet 2002, there are some exciting things happening
in 2003.</p>
<p>Firstly, some changes to the format of the Spring Meeting in
York means that delegates can now register on a daily basis. This
is good news for many industrial group members whose work
commitments make it difficult to take a whole week off. There are
lots of details in this newsletter; so please do have a look
through the program a
nd come along. This is a good opportunity to
meet fellow diffractionists and also look at some of the latest
developments in hardware/software in the commercial
exhibition.</p>
<p>Finally, please consider putting together something for a
poster - you might win a prize! The meeting offers excellent
training opportunities (less than &pound;100 per day full board!)
so recommend the meeting to your colleagues.</p>
<p>Also in this newsletter are details of the Autumn Forum. This
promises to be a fantast
ic event with something for everyone and
a chance to enjoy the capital for a couple of days; maybe
longer.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who have kindly submitted articles for this
newsletter. I am always looking for contributions.</p>

<h3>Quantitative Analysis Round Robin</h3>
<p><b>Online Registration for your Samples<a href="../quantrr.htm"> REGISTER NOW!</a></b> </p>
<p>The BCA Industrial Group is launching a quantitative analysis
Round Robin.</
p>

<p>Two samples are available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic - a mixture of paracetamol and lactose.</li>
<li>Inorganic - a mixture of Rutile and Anatase.</li>
</ol>
<p>The exercise will be discussed on the Thursday afternoon of
the Spring meeting.</p>
<p>The choice of technique will be up to the individual
participant.</p>
<p>Full details are not available as we go to press with this
Newsletter more details will be available on the IG web pages by
the time you receive your copy. <a href="../quantrr.
htm"> AVAILABLE NOW!</a></p>
<p>Please volunteer to take part to test the accuracy of your
quantitative analysis technique.</p>
<p>A prize of a bottle of champagne will be awarded to the
participant whose result is closest to the theoretical
composition for each sample. In the event of a tie the judges
will consume the prize!</p>
<p>These exercises can provide useful insight into the best
choice of technique for particular samples. Please take part or
at least come to the session at York and listen
 to the
discussion.</p>

<h3>The 2nd Pharmaceutical Powder X-ray Diffraction
Symposium</h3>
<p>Concordville, Pennsylvania, USA 9-12th December 2002</p>
<p>The symposium, which focuses on the use of XRPD for the
analysis of pharmaceutical materials, comes three years after
PPXRD-1 and the content reflected the dramatic rise in status of
XRPD within pharmaceutical industry dur
ing that time. Structure
determination for organics was the 'cutting edge' of PPXRD-1; at
PPXRD-2, that baton was passed to high-throughput crystallisation
and the screening and identification of polymorphic forms and
salts.</p>
<p>The symposium opened with a day dedicated to the acquisition
and analysis of XRPD data. Various representatives of academia,
pharmaceutical industry, equipment manufacturers, analytical labs
and database vendors covered the full spectrum of methods now
available for exam
ining pharmaceuticals as raw materials and as
finished products. Whilst the emphasis was very much on
'in-house' laboratory XRPD (both 'standard' and
'high-throughput'), synchrotron radiation was also represented.
The talks ended with a session on powder indexing and an evening
poster session. It was clear by the end of the day that a great
many ingenious hardware and software solutions have been
developed to specifically target the problems currently occupying
pre-formulation and formulation labora
tories in industry.</p>
<p>The second day opened with a session on polymorph
characterisation. Again, the speakers represented all interested
parties and presented results from challenging problems,
including determining the dynamics of dehydration in indapamide
hemihydrate, 'clustering' of low-quality XRPD patterns for phase
identification and characterisation of four polymorphs
offananserine. High-throughput crystallisation techniques that
allowed up to ~300 crystallisations per day for a single l
ead
compound were also clearly explained. The afternoon session
focused-down on structure determination from powder data, and a
wide range of examples including zopiclone, anhydrous caffeine
(Z'=5) and a disordered form of ranitidine were presented,
underlining the fact that structure solution is no longer
strictly the preserve of the dedicated crystallographer.</p>
<p>The final day opened with a session on regulatory and patent
issues. As is normal for such sessions, a number of well-known
litigat
ion cases including cefadroxil and ranitidine were
discussed in order to highlight the differences between the
scientific and legal arguments involved. Unsurprisingly, it was
made quite clear that it was na&iuml;ve to believe that
'scientific truth' was the be-all and end-all of any given
litigation. The closing session, which changed tack to cover
applications of small-angle X-ray scattering to pharmaceutical
materials, jarred somewhat with the main thrust of the symposium,
but nevertheless highlig
hted some interesting pharmaceutical
themes, which will no doubt be built upon in future meetings.</p>
<p>The final day consisted of an instrument calibration and
indexing workshop at the nearby ICDD Headquarters, which I was
unfortunately not able to attend, but which benefited greatly
from the contributions of expert tutors.</p>
<p>At the end of the symposium, one left with the impression that
XRPD has a bright future within pharmaceutical industry. This is
a remarkable transformation for a techni
que that was, until quite
recently, viewed as useful merely for fingerprinting or for
providing a set of d-spacings for a table in a patent. The
emergent key phrase 'high-throughput' is destined to resonate
loudly in years to come. All speakers placed an emphasis on
obtaining the best-possible XRPD data in order to make subsequent
analysis of the data easier. It was clear that without
high-quality data collection and data analysis, high-throughput
XRPD will simply result in a massive collection of p
atterns that
cannot be gainfully used.</p>
<p>The only disappointing aspect of the meeting was the
relatively poor attendance. Some of this can be put down to the
timing of the meeting and the existence of a similar analytical
meeting held in the summer and an ACS meeting on polymorphism
being held early in the 2003. For those who stayed away, this was
an opportunity missed to hear exactly how 'solution seekers' and
'solution providers' are working closely together to push an
analytical technique f
orward. The meeting was well organised and
enhanced by an openness on the part of the speakers to discuss
failures, as well as successes, and talks were (with only one
exception) firmly rooted in science / technology and were
refreshingly free of 'sales pitch' for hardware, software and
services.</p>

<h3>PANalytical XRD User Group Meeting</h3>
<p>Millennium Point, Birmingham<br>
22nd October 2002</p>
<p>A dozen or so intrepid diffractionists made their way through
rush-hour traffic to the Millennium Point, Birmingham for the
first 'PANalytical' XRD User Group meeting since its name change
from Philips Analytical in September. The morning session opened
with Users being brought up-to date with the current status of
the company (Robin Aird). The new X'Celerator
 detector was then
discussed by Martijn Franson with an explanation of the 'Real
Time Multiple Strip' technology that underpins its response. Paul
O'Meara then went on to explain the new X'Pert Data Collector
Software. There is now no need for the 'Organiser' software and
X'Pert Highscore and Data Viewer now replace Graphics Identify.
Uli Riedle explained the new XRDML file structure - more
information about which can be found at www.XRDML.com. The
session was concluded with John Benstead outlining 
what affects
the lifetime of an X-ray tube. Essentially, it is due to filament
material forming on the anode surface but it was interesting to
find out what accelerates this - from temperature and water
quality to tube power settings.</p>
<p>The afternoon session gave Users an opportunity to have their
say. Contributors were David Gleeson (Nanomagnetics Ltd), Jeff
Howe (Alcan Primary Metal), Sasha Babkevich (Oxford University),
Mike Morris (Cork University) and Colin Small (Rolls Royce).
Several of
 the speakers and others present, commented on the new
X'Celerator detector. Users agreed that the detector greatly
reduces acquisition time and one User said something along the
lines of 'observations to date would indicate that 'PANalytical'
is correct in its assertion that the detector is 100x quicker
than other detectors' - how's that for a scientific response?</p>
<p>Now, let's be honest, the highlight of the day was the visit
to the I-Max Cinema which PANalytical had kindly organised at the
en
d of the meeting. We were supplied with 3D glasses. The film we
saw was Cyberworld - a 3D animated film involving the hunt for a
computer virus in electronic circuitry - I think! Anyway, we saw
a collection of weird and wonderful 3D creatures and the film was
quite impressive. However, as scientists, we were equally
interested in the technology and more than one of us tried to
observe the effects by rotating our 3D glasses, looking through
one eye-piece only and looking the wrong way through the glas
ses!
Overall, a very informative and entertaining day. Thankyou
PANalytical.</p>
