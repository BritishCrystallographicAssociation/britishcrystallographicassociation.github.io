<h2>Diffraction reaches the parts oth

reach</h2>

<p><img src="99T1f1.jpg" alt="film- diffraction patern"></p>

<p>The human body is a complex, dynamic biological system which
is, at best, poorly understood. Fortunately for
crystallographers, much of our tissues contain significant
amounts of crystalline or semi-crystalline materials. In many
cases, the nature of these materials can provide information that
enables us to study ageing and disease processes. Further, with
the development of improved data collec
tion and analysis methods,
diffraction has started to provide doctors with some disease
diagnoses.</p>

<p>The most frequently formed biological mineral is a calcium
salt usually approximated by hexagonal calcium hydroxyapatite
(HAP) which constitutes the majority inorganic material of bone
and teeth. However, tissue deposition of other calcium phases are
also associated with a wide range of significant medical problems
such as breast cancer, renal disease, atherosclerosis
bioprosthetic heart valv
e failure and arthritis.</p>

<p>Generally, biological minerals have a small crystallite size
(specific surface areas are typically &gt;100
m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>), are non-stoichiometric
(<i>apatite</i> comes from the Greek word <i>deceive</i>), and
show extensive inheterogeneity. A major challenge for the
diffractionist is significant overlapping of broad Bragg maxima.
This has resulted in many analysts choosing to utilise only a
very limited part of the diffraction patterns (often 1 peak) t
o
characterise the materials. However, application of techniques
such as the Rietveld method is allowing more structural details
to be revealed.</p>

<h3>Diagnosing breast cancer</h3>

<p>Breast tissue is an unusually dynamic system with respect to
the deposition of biological minerals. Radiologists frequently
utilise the radiographic appearance of breast tissue mineral
deposits as a 'first line' diagnostic tool for signs of malignant
change. Despite this, the precise nature of these deposits is

unclear, although a common misconception is that only HAP and a
calcium oxalate are formed. Pathologists often correlate these
two phases to the tumour type, but do not use diffraction to
provide the phase determination, instead relying on non-phase
specific methods such as staining. There is some evidence that
there is a wide range of phases formed and that the phase
sensitively reflects tissue pathophysiology e.g. be a marker for
tumour grade &amp; type. Recently, small angle X-ray scattering
has
 been used to demonstrate a significant difference in the
structural order of tumour collagen when compared to adjacent
tissue. This may lead to a simple, <i>in vivo</i> test for
malignant tumours based upon the coherent scattering that is
currently disregarded by the radiologist when producing a
mammogram.</p>

<h3>Characterising bone</h3>

<p>Bone is a composite material that is continuously remodelled
throughout life. The mineral component resembles HAP, and
possesses key functional characteri
stics such as crystallite
size, stoichiometry and preferred orientation. These
characteristics are known to change with age and in response to
diseases such as osteoporosis. Interestingly, bone mineral
texture has also shown evolutionary, adaptive changes that result
in modification of bone mechanical properties. It should be
appreciated that complete crystallographic interpretation of
diffraction data from human bone mineral remains rare. Indeed the
precise nature of the mineral is still a matter o
f some
conjecture.</p>

<h3>Kidney stone architecture</h3>

<p>Most 'normal' humans produce some crystalline material within
their urine. A significant medical question is why in some people
these crystals go on to form stones before they can be excreted.
In fact, agglomerations of relatively large mineral crystals can
be found in many parts of the urinary system. The nature of the
many (&gt;20) minerals found within urinary stones was determined
in the 1960 ' s. However, current medical interest
 focuses upon
the detail of the internal stone architecture (crystal
growth/agglomeration patterns) so that new treatments e.g. laser
lithotripsy, can be optimised. Also it is hoped that
pre-treatment diagnosis of the stone type being formed may be
acquired from the diffraction data of 'urine debris'.</p>

<p>Sadly, the potential of diffraction to provide diagnosis or
fundamental data is grossly under exploited by the medical
community. However, a hope is that the use of diffraction will,
in futur
e, become an invaluable medical tool. Have a good look at
the equipment next time you are unfortunate enough to be in
hospital - there may just be a diffractometer next to the ECG
machine!</p>
