<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>As the end of 1998 approaches, the Industrial Group can look
back on a ver
y successful programme, a Pharmaceutical meeting in
March, an excellent Spring Meeting at St Andrews, elevated
temperature and stress meetings later in the year, and finally
the Autumn meeting. All were well attended, presentations were of
a uniformly high quality and the range of subject matter very
wide. The forthcoming year presents a different but still
exciting scene, with an Industrial Group Forum in April, the
detailed programme for which is included in this edition, and
then Glasgow in Augus
t. A year to look forward to,
crystallographically speaking!</p>

<p>The Newsletter has been well received, but production costs
are such that I would ask you to take note of the notice inside
re electronic copy and the WWW. On a personal note, this will be
my last newsletter since I am handing over the reins to Colin
Small. I would like to thank the various contributors who have
made my job most interesting and the companies who, through their
generosity have funded the production during my tenure
.</p>

<h2>Chairman's Message</h2>

<p>May I first of all wish our members and readers a very happy
Christmas and a good and prosperous New Year.</p>

<p>The latter part of 1998 has seen a successful first with the
Residual Stress Workshop held at the Open University in
September. Everything I have heard about the meeting suggests
that it was very informative and stimulating for learners and old
hands alike. The Autumn Meet
ing, hosted by Zeneca at Runcorn,
continued the IG tradition with an excellent programme in
comfortable surroundings. It was particularly good to see the
interest shown by delegates in topics from very different fields.
More than one person was heard to say, " I really should come to
these meetings more often". Congratulations and thanks to the
organizers of both events.</p>

<p>In 1999 you should not have so many decisions to make about
which meetings to attend. Persuade your manager or mortgage y
our
diffractometer, but come to the Industrial Crystallography Forum
at Coventry in April. The programme is building very nicely and
should offer something for everyone interested in industrial
crystallography. Most of the Group's activities for the year have
been built in, so that you can fit a couple of special interest
group meetings along with more general sessions into the two-day
package. Since the meeting takes place in a well-appointed hotel,
there should also be opportunities to use the swi
mming pool and
gym, not to mention the bar. Do not forget that this could be
your only opportunity to avail yourself of our Group BCA
membership scheme, built into the meeting costs. The Committee
has not yet reached a final decision on holding an Autumn Meeting
this year, so please let us know what you think.</p>

<p>The other major event for the year will be the IUCr Congress
at Glasgow in August. You should already have received at least
one invitation. For many crystallographers working in UK i
ndustry
it will represent a unique opportunity to experience state of the
art crystallography on a world scale. Powder diffraction and many
topics of industrial interest and involvement have been built
into the heart of the programme. Your question is not likely to
be, 'Is there really anything of interest here for me?' but
rather, "How can I possibly hear all that is relevant?" We intend
that IG will be represented, particularly by Colin Small's
collage of industrial British crystallography.</p>


<p>1999 will be different, and I trust that will mean exciting. I
look forward to seeing you at Coventry.</p>

<
h2>1998 Denver X-ray Conference Review</h2>

<p>The 1998 Denver X-ray Conference took place August 3-7 at the
Antlers Doubletree Hotel, Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>

<p>In 1951, the University of Denver held a one-day symposium on
the use of X-rays and their importance in modern research. From
these humble beginnings, the Denver X-ray Conference has grown to
provide a leading forum for scientists working in the field of
X-ray materials analysis. This 47th conference was organised by
an eleven s
trong committee and run by ICDD. The conference hosted
389 registered attendees and 275 exhibitors who represented 39
companies. The commercial exhibition, housed in the hotel
ballroom, was open 10-5 Mon to Wed and 10-2 Thur. Delegates were
drawn to the exhibition for refreshment breaks totalling 3 hours
each day. The programme and abstract book ran to over 250 pages
and included 13 pages of colour advertisements.</p>

<p>The technical program offered two days of tutorial workshops,
followed by thr
ee days of invited, contributed and poster
presentations on a variety of topics covering both X-ray
Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques.</p>

<p>Apart from a half-day Plenary Session, there were 4 or 5
parallel sessions from which to choose. In fact out of a total of
fourteen workshops you could only attend four and from eighteen
oral sessions you only had time for five. This inevitably caused
a conflict of interest and it was often difficult to choose from
equally compelling 
sessions. However, sessions did keep to time
enabling delegates to flit between presentations. Some sessions
were dedicated to topics common to both techniques. One parallel
stream always related specifically to XRF and is not detailed in
this review.</p>

<p>The ten XRD and joint workshops included: Specimen
Preparation; The Design, Alignment, Calibration &amp; Performance
Characteristics of the Conventional Diffractometer; Use of Total
Pattern Fitting for Quantitative Phase Analysis; Reflectometr
y
for Surface &amp; Thin-Film Characterisation; Principles &amp;
Use of Microdiffraction &amp; Microfluorescence; Conclusions from
the Intensity Round Robin; Diffractometer Optics; High
Temperature XRD.</p>

<p>The well-prepared handouts given in each workshop will be a
useful future reference.</p>

<p>Ron Jenkins (ICDD) introduced the plenary session on Wednesday
morning. Two awards were made at the start of this session. The
1998 Birks Award was presented to Dr. Horst Ebel of Technische
Univer
sit&auml;t Wien, Austria, recognizing his excellence in the
field of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Dr. Herb G&ouml;bel of
Siemens AG, Germany, received the J.D. Hanawalt Award for his
important recent contribution to the field of X-ray powder
diffraction. Dr. G&ouml;bel also presented a lecture on his
recognised work entitled <i>"High Temperature Studies with Oven
Cameras"</i> at the conference.</p>

<p>The session continued with invited presentations on: X-ray
Optics;</p>

<p>Microcalorimeter
 EDS with 3 eV Energy Resolution;</p>

<p>XRF Detection Limits - How Low Can We Go?</p>

<p>Synchrotron Applications of Powder Diffraction and X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy.</p>

<p>Other XRD and joint technical sessions included:</p>

<p>Synchrotron Applications of XRD &amp; XRF; Developments in
Detectors for X-ray Analysis;</p>

<p>Recent Advances in X-ray Optics; Recent Developments in
Instrumentation &amp; Data Treatment;</p>

<p>Micro XRF/XRD; Residual Stresses; Diffraction
Applications
;</p>

<p>Thin Films: Orientation, Stress, Thickness; Innovative
Applications of Rietveld Analysis;</p>

<p>Impact of Rietveld Analysis &amp; Use of Calculated Patterns
in Quantitative Phase Analysis;</p>

<p>Materials Process Characterization by Diffraction.</p>

<p>Social activities included several evening mixers with
excellent buffet food and drink sponsored by various exhibitors.
On Sunday, Bede Scientific, Claisse Scientifique, and SPEX
CertiPrep sponsored the welcoming reception. On Mond
ay the
reception was sponsored by Bruker AXS and held in conjunction
with the XRF Poster Session. The XRD Poster Session, on Tuesday
evening, was held alongside a reception given by Rigaku/USA and
MDI with impressive ice sculptured logos as centre pieces. ICDD
provided refreshments after its Technical Committee Meeting on
Wednesday evening. The social activities culminated with the
conference dinner on Thursday evening. Guests were entertained by
humorous stories presented by volunteers attending th
e
conference. A panel of accompanying spouses judged that the prize
for best story went to Ron Jenkins.</p>

<p>The conference provided an excellent opportunity to see the
latest innovations from all the major equipment suppliers with
lots of equipment on display. The wide array of technical
presentations running in parallel ensured that there was always
something of interest going on. However, the inevitable clashes
made it impossible to attend everything of interest. The only
answer is a return 
visit next year. It runs 2-6 August 1999 at
Sheraton Steamboat Resort, Steamboat Springs, Colorado. In
conclusion, the hotel facilities were superb, the organisation
flawless, the atmosphere friendly and the technical content
excellent - it certainly exceeded my expectations. I thank Terry
Maguire, ICDD for providing information to support this
review.</p>

<h2>Newsletter Mailing list.</h2>

<p>It is important that the Industrial Group maintains an up to
date mailing list.</p>

<p>Please let Dave Taylor (address in list of officers) know if
you change address, if there is a more appropriate contact in
your organis
ation or you no longer require a paper copy.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is now posted on our WEB site:
(http://gordon.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/IG/ig.htm). We will soon have back
issues in place from 1995. Why not have a browse and let me know
what you think. As a trial some members (mostly overseas) are now
being informed by e-mail when each new edition is mounted.</p>

<p>To reduce costs (almost a pound a copy) we hope to extend this
method in future. If you are prepared to switch from a paper copy
(and help sa
ve the trees) to e-mail notification of the WEB
posting, then send an e-mail to:<br>
Dave Taylor <a href=
