<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>Welcome to this latest issue of the IG newsletter. 
There are a number of excellent meeting reports in this issue along 
with details of the forthcoming Spring Meeting and two-day Autumn Meeting. 
Please do try to come along. At the AGM, proposed changes to the 
Industrial Group Constitution will be discussed concerning membership 
of the Committee and their nomination. Please read the Chairman's 
thoughts on this very important matter on page 2. Please also read 
the proposed changes on the same page and contact the Secretary/Treasurer 
if there are issues you want to raise concerned with these changes. 
The AGM is on Wednesday 13th April at 4pm. Please make every effort to attend.</p> 
<p>The Committee is proposing a two-day Autumn meeting again this year with 
themes around Patents and Crystallography in Industry. Make a note in 
your diary now.</p>
<p>Finally, a big thank you to all those who have written contributions for this issue.

<h2>A few thoughts from your Chairman:</h2>

<p>This issue of the BCA Industrial Group Newsletter will bring to your attention a proposed change to the constitution rules of the group.  Although I find it sad to see more and more industries abandon the use of their own research laboratories in favour of out-sourcing to other laboratories, particularly those in academia, nonetheless one has to recognise the facts.  It has been particularly noticeable in the last six months as several committee members have found themselves at the heart of laboratory closures.  Although I still perceive the BCA Industrial Group to be in healthy state, I feel it is important for our future that the number of committee members from academic institutions is no longer limited to three as in the present constitution.  For this reason, proposed changes to the constitution are being made to the membership for discussion and hopefully your approval at the next AGM.
</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that the program for the next BCA Spring Meeting should be suited to those with an interest in industrial crystallography given the themes of in-situ and non-ambient crystallography as the majority of industrial processes are carried out under a variety of conditions.  As a member of this year's programme committee, I conveyed the ideas of the BCA-IG committee so as to provide a variety of programme slots in this year's Spring Meeting of interest to BCA-IG members.  In addition, through the hard work of two of your committee members, Dave Taylor and David Beveridge, there will be a parallel programme on the subject of XRF, a first for a BCA spring meeting.  At the present moment, XRF being an X-ray spectroscopic rather than a diffraction-based technique has no home within the BCA.  So a further subject for discussion at this year's AGM will be whether the Industrial Group should consider enlarging its membership base beyond its traditional strength in PXRD so as to include XRF.  Obviously, this would require further changes to the constitution, but I look forward to a lively discussion on this subject, either at the AGM or by email to me if you cannot attend.
</p>
<p>The past 6 months has been busy for your chairman too.  Although our old <i>Industrial Materials Group</i> laboratories at Birkbeck are being demolished to make way for biophysics group in the School of Crystallography, Paul Barnes and myself have moved on to newly-built laboratory space within the new <i>Materials Chemistry Centre</i> within the Department of Chemistry, UCL.  But while we are the fortunate ones with a bright future ahead, I still empathise strongly with those less fortunate and under threat of laboratory closure.  Despite these problems for some, I do hope that most of you will still have the opportunity to attend this year's meeting and AGM at Loughborough.

organisation or if you no longer require a copy please let us
know by contacting any of the <a href=

<h3>BOOK REVIEW:<br>
 "X-Ray and Electron Diffraction Studies in Materials
Science"</h3>
<h6>Author: D J Dyson<br>
Publisher: Maney 2004 368 pages<br>
Price: (hardback) &pound;78 ($133) ISBN 1902653742</h6>
<p>It is good to see a new book on x-ray and electron diffraction
aimed at the less experienced analyst working in a materials
laboratory that will also find use as an undergraduate learning
aid. Supplying the units in formulae throughout the text is
welcomed and will assist more detailed calculations. The author
draws on his 40 years experience in the steel industry to add a
wealth of real examples to illustrate the subject. The text
covers a wide range of topics including useful sections on
texture and electron diffraction which add to a balanced overview
of the subject and its everyday application to Phase ID,
quantitative and size strain analysis. The book is well supported
with photographs and clear diagrams which complement the text as
do comprehensive references.</p>
<p>The first half of the book has sections on; real space,
crystal chemistry, intensity of diffraction, stereographic
projection, instrument consideration and line profiles which
provide a good grounding in the basics of crystallography and the
theory of diffraction. The first chapter (p1 - 44) on Real Space
gives a very clear introduction, through; symmetry, lattices,
space groups to Bragg's law, of the basic crystallographic
concepts needed for a full understanding of diffraction.</p>
<p>The second chapter (p45 - 76) on Crystal Chemistry encompasses
the packing of atoms within the crystal structure, building up
from simple to complex inorganic systems and covering
interstitial phases, metallic glasses and silicates. The next
chapter on Intensity of Diffraction (p77-98) covers the factors
which influence the intensity of a reflection and the equations
needed to calculate its intensity, focussing particularly on the
cubic system. The fourth chapter provides a useful explanation of
Stereographic Projection (p99 -114) underpinning its use in later
chapters. The next chapter on Instrument Considerations (p115 -
135) covers just the basics for x-ray diffraction and offers
simple practical information on instrument parameters. The sixth
chapter is devoted to Line Profiles (p136 - 160) and explains the
factors which affect the size and shape of diffraction peaks and
offers useful advice on the use of peak fitting routines.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 sees a move into applications and covers Phase
Identification (p161 - 189). It starts with peak location and
associated errors, moves on to intensity and then identification.
It has sections on precision, reference materials and the figures
of merit used to scale database searches. The next chapter covers
Quantitative Analysis (p191 - 234) and starts with validation
which is becoming increasingly important as we strive for
standardisation. It covers sampling and preparation, instrument
considerations specific to quantitative work and the various
procedural methods. Particular cases are studied including:
airborne dusts, glassy phase, metals and clay minerals. This
chapter is supported by 44 references, more than any other.
Chapter 9 covers Crystallite Size Analysis (p235 - 248) and
offers practical advice on the various methods and their
application. The next chapter covers the specialised field of
Thin Layers (p249 - 271) and introduces the use of high
resolution equipment and is followed by Crystallographic Texture
(p273 - 317) which is well supported with useful pictures and
diagrams which help put across what is often a difficult subject
in a comprehensible way. A section on Electron Backscatter leads
on to the final chapter on Electron Diffraction and its Relation
to XRD (p319 - 354). Here theoretical aspects including the
reciprocal lattice are interspersed with practical explanations
and comparisons to provide a useful grounding in understanding
the complementary nature of the two disciplines.</p>
<p>All laboratories working on the everyday applications of x-ray
and electron diffraction will find this book a useful addition to
their bookshelf.</p>
