<h3>An Introduction to Amorphous Materials</h3>
<p>26 April, 2002</p>
<p>Industrial crystallographers often develop something of a
blind spot for am
orphous materials, even when they are regularly
present in the materials routinely handled. We can try to justify
a lack of interest by saying that amorphous phases are not
crystalline and therefore not the responsibility of the
crystallographer. The fact is, of course, that X-ray and neutron
scattering can give much useful information about non-crystalline
materials but the techniques of data collection and
interpretation take us beyond the familiar world of high order.
The session was chaired by <
b>Dave Taylor</b> (ICDD) and was, of
necessity, a very brief introduction.</p>
<p><b>John Parker</b> (Sheffield) gave helpful summary of
&ldquo;Measurement, Interpretation and Case Studies&rdquo;,
relating much of the tutorial to his interests in glassy
materials. The areas covered included: the principles underlying
scattering by randomly and non-randomly spaced atoms; problems
arising from inelastic scattering and other corrections to
experimental data; calculation of the radial distribution
func
tion and pair correlation function; termination and
convergence errors; the need to use shorter wavelengths than Cu
and the benefits of neutrons; modelling and network models for
glass. An important reason for the decline in laboratory X-ray
scattering studies of amorphous materials lies in the need for
short wavelengths to access nearest neighbour information. It
seems that the most practical options for reliable results
(including the alternative approach of EXAFS) mean starting work
at a neutron 
or synchrotron source.</p>
<p><b>Geoff Mitchell</b> (Reading) addressed another area with
its own set of problems, &ldquo;Quantification of Crystalline and
Amorphous Fractions&rdquo;. Much of the talk was framed around
examples from the world of semi-crystalline polymers, but the
principles were applicable elsewhere. In principle, crystallinity
determination should be simply related to the scattering power of
the crystalline and amorphous phases. However, even the
definition of crystallinity is not 
simple for polymers and really
comes down to the distinction between broad and sharp peaks. This
was shown to be relatively easy for some materials such as linear
polyethylene at low Q, but increasingly difficult at higher Q due
to huge numbers of closely-spaced reflections. There are once
again practical problems from necessary corrections, including
those for inelastic and parasitic scattering and those for
geometry. Issues around peak fitting are crucial and a range of
techniques has been used, s
ome based on theory that is difficult
to put into practice, others on a more pragmatic basis.
Establishing the shape of the amorphous component is particularly
difficult. Variable temperature measurements and quenching from
the melt have been used, but it is important to realise that the
amorphous scattering curve can change significantly over a
relatively narrow temperature range. Overall, this was a very
helpful introduction for many to an area with hidden pitfalls and
a useful update for those da
bbling in the field over the
years.</p>
<p>Amorphous materials continue to grow in technological
importance (e.g. pharmaceuticals, polymers, electronics,
catalysts). Ignoring them because they are &ldquo;not
crystalline&rdquo; does seem like burying our heads in the
quartz. I will not be surprised if this topic appears again
soon.</p>

<h3>Workshop - Powder Diffraction Surgery</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Powder diffraction&rdquo; mea
ns different things to
different people. This session was a follow-up from the Rietveld
refinement workshop and that set the starting point for the
discussion. <b>Jeremy Cockcroft</b> was in the chair and his
first task, with a little coaxing, was to assemble a
&lsquo;panel&rsquo; to field the questions. <b>John Evans, Robin
Shirley, Lachlan Cranswick and Bill David</b> eventually
succumbed and took their places at the front.</p>
<p>The discussion started with the optimum experimental
conditions fo
r &lsquo;H&rsquo; positions by neutron diffraction
with deuteration. Bill David advocated medium resolution and huge
count rates, but it was claimed that the job could be done better
by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The optimum solution could
depend on whether the atomic positions or electron density maps
were sought.</p>
<p>The capabilities of national powder diffraction facilities and
access to them were obviously close to the hearts of many
academic practitioners. The need for both powder and
 single
crystal facilities at Diamond was keenly felt. The ISIS GEM
facility was producing &ldquo;immense&rdquo; data rates, but what
do you do with a thousand patterns a day? Meanwhile, about one
case in three was getting beam time at most facilities via peer
review.</p>
<p>Variable count-rate data collection has long been advocated
for Rietveld studies. This is no problem where users write or
influence the software, but it would require fundamental
modifications to the data formats used by commer
cial laboratory
systems. The best that could be achieved by those collecting data
for Rietveld refinement on such systems was to combine multiple
scans over different ranges or boost high angle count rates with
programmable slits. It was suggested that the more sophisticated
data collection strategies could also help more traditional XRPD
applications, such as phase identification. This might just be
the route to galvanising manufacturers into action. However,
there could be a mountain of software r
ewrites, particularly to
take account of errors with variable count rates.</p>
<p>One thing leads to another, and the lack of publicly available
software for merging data sets was bemoaned. It was pointed out
that this was the kind of routine that many users would write in
a few lines of code. Sadly, it seems that few scientists are now
taught programming, so spreadsheets might be more realistic for
many.</p>
<p>A straw poll showed that Rietveld refinement was being used in
industry, sometimes just
 for the simpler tasks of lattice
parameter refinement or phase quantification. In these cases
there was no need for the full Rietveld procedures and it was
important to choose the parameters for refinement carefully. This
led to discussions of the statistical problems associated with
background removal and the merits of Pawley and Debye fitting
procedures. The applicability of Rietveld to thin films was
raised, but there seem to be problems with line shapes.</p>
<p>The session ended with a few ever
green topics. The Powder
Diffraction File is becoming more sophisticated in its database
guise and expanding enormously with incorporation of patterns
from the inorganic and Cambridge databases. Rather than publish
large numbers of full powder patterns, ICDD was incorporating the
ability to simulate patterns for different experimental
configurations. Optimising diffractometer slits for individual
experiments is obviously the right thing to do, unless you work
in a laboratory with lots of hands-on us
ers and the chaos that
might ensue. A small side step from this topic led to the
tribulations of variable slits, particularly when they stick in
one position. We can all understand the embarrassment of having
such difficulties identified after the data has left the lab!</p>
<p>This was a wide ranging session that took a little time to get
going but eventually got many of the audience involved, covering
a range of relevant topics and producing interesting answers.
There is clearly an important place 
for regular open discussions
of this type, but the huge range of interests amongst powder
diffractionists inevitably results in fewer topics that grab
everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>

<h3>Workshop - Introduction to Thin Films</h3>
<p>This workshop is one of a series of specialist tutorials, run
by the Industrial Group, to introduce new users to different
X-ray techniques. Glancing Incidence X-Ray Analysis (GIXA) is
used to dete
rmine the thickness, density and interface roughness
and of one or more layers on samples, which are optically flat.
Typical examples are anti-reflective coatings applied to glass
and also structures used in the electronics industry, i.e.
multi-layers on magnetic disks. When a thin layer, (or layers)
are irradiated by an X-ray beam which is incident at a low angle
(the scan range is typically, 0 to 3<font face=
"Symbol">&deg;</font> 2<font face="Symbol">q</font> ) an
interference pattern is produced
. The X-rays are reflected from
the interfaces, between the various layers and also the interface
between the layers and the substrate. The interference pattern is
a function of the thickness, roughness and density of the layers.
This information can be extracted from the pattern by fitting a
simulated profile based on estimated, starting values. The method
is applicable to layers, which are either crystalline or
amorphous.</p>
<p><b>Paul Fewster</b> of Philips Analytical Research started the
sessi
on off by describing the physics behind the simulation. He
described how the properties of thickness, roughness and density
influence the shape of the pattern. His talk was very well
illustrated with some inventive PowerPoint graphics showing the
propagation of the wave front through the layers. Paul expanded
his argument to include the determination of in- plane
crystallite size and lateral correlation.</p>
<p><b>Christoph Schug</b>, of IBM Materials Laboratory, Mainz,
Germany described the practic
al considerations for GIXA
measurements. Firstly, Christoph described the attributes of the
ideal sample, both the substrate and the layers: A flat, smooth
substrate with an RMS roughness of &lt;10&Aring; which has a
sufficient difference in refractive index from the layer(s). For
example, use a Ge wafer when studying silicon based layers, as
their refractive indices are sufficiently different. The various
experimental configurations were then compared and contrasted.
Christoph described his favorit
e,</p>
<ul>
<li>A parabolic, multi-layer mirror for the primary optics which
removes the K<font face="Symbol">b</font> and provides plenty of
intensity</li>
<li>A beam knife, to limit the irradiated area at such small 28
and <font face="Symbol">w</font> angles</li>
<li>Copper foil attenuator to protect the detector from the
primary beam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next the care needed with sample alignment was emphasized and
data collection strategies needed to ensure a good fit to the
simulated profile. Chr
istoph then gave tips to ensure an accurate
fit between the measured and simulated data. The talk was
illustrated with examples, from a simple NiO layer sputtered on a
silicon substrate, to complex examples of the layers on magnetic
media.</p>
<p>Sadly, we didn't really have enough time to do justice to such
an extensive and useful technique, which is quite removed from
the more common, powder diffraction methods. However, both
speakers made an excellent job, providing a stimulating
introduction to
 a fascinating subject.</p>

<h3>Autumn Meeting 2002 Report</h3>
<p><b>Plus ca change - or an exile's return.</b></p>
<p>Despite having been a member of the
economically-inactive-but-less-than-senior-citizen-age army for
the best part of ten years, an Autumn Meeting in Manchester, my
home town, was an unmissable opportunity! The Old Dining Room of
Hulme Hall, where we were watched ove
r by the portraits of
distinguished clerical fellows, proved a most suitable venue for
an informal but informative presentation of eight papers on
Sample Preparation Techniques.</p>
<p>I had wondered how much would have changed since I was
actively involved in xrd but I found that, although progress has
led to further improvements in the hardware, many of the problems
discussed were familiar and many of the usual suspects were
present at the gathering! We heard of the techniques developed in
respon
se to sample preparation problems with materials gathered
from tidal flats (Martin Gill, Museum of Natural History), from
surfactants (Richard Morris, Huntsman Surface Sciences), from
aero-engines (Colin Small, Rolls Royce) and from pharmaceutical
materials (Chris Frampton, University of Southampton). In
addition, the selection and preparation of samples for residual
stress and texture measurements (Phil Holdway, QinetiQ) and the
practical problems in contract analytical work (Ros Shwartz,
London &a
mp; Scandinavian Metallurgical) were reviewed. In a
paper on lattice parameters and sample displacement, we were
reminded of the need to consider possible sources of error
arising from the nature of the sample (Mary Vickers, University
of Cambridge).</p>
<p>A novel idea was the use of a torque wrench to ensure
consistent compression of samples needing a binder - that seemed
to be a good one!</p>
<p>Other papers reminded of the need for an understanding of what
we are doing, why we do it the way we 
do and getting clear what
we think we need to find out.</p>
<p>In fact, not a lot had changed: all the old things about
consistent care, consistent technique, consistent alignment
checks remain as true as ever.</p>

<h5>Industrial Group Award</h5>
</center>
<p>During the Meeting, the latest in the series of Industrial
Group Awards was given to Jo Jutson to mark her service to the
BCA and her helpful involvement in the wider scientific
community. Chris Frampton gave
 a short address, reviewing Jo's
scientific career and contributions. (He omitted to note that
this has included scientific presentations to her WI Branch: I
wonder if this is unique among recipients of the Award?) Chris
invited Jo to give her paper "From Spinel Analysis to Micro X-ray
Diffraction - a Personal View of Applications and Advances" which
she did with her characteristic modesty and clarity.</p>
<p>Jo is pictured receiving the award from Prof Chris Frampton
and alongside the Beevers model
 of a spinel.</p>
