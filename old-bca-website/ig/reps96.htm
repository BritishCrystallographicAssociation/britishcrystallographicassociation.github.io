<h2>X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTION in the PHARMACEUTlCAL INDUSTRY.</h2>

<h3>a meeting held at Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, l8th March
1996</h3>

<p>This meeting was attended by 45 people, mainly industrial
users of powder crystallography in the pharmaceutical industry.
There were also representatives from academia, agrochemi
cals,
dyestuffs, and forensic science who all have some interest in
relatively small organic molecules as opposed to the inorganic
applications pursued by most of the powder crystallographic
community. In general, organics crystallise in large, 'soft' unit
cells of low absorption with diffraction characterised over a
relatively small range of 2 theta (typically ca. 0-35 degrees).
Indexing as a proof of purity and quantitation of polymorphic
mixtures are particularly important issues.</p>

<p>Dr St
eve Tarling discussed the power of the technique for
defending patent protection of polymorphs. The cost of XRPD
equipment is insignificant compared to the legal costs of patent
litigation!. The theme was continued by Dr Marek Zakrzewski
(Philips;Holland) who discussed the factors influencing the
nature of pharmaceutical products (habit, milling, desired
polymorph), The role of single crystal data, theoretical powder
patterns and molecular modelling was also considered.</p>

<p>Dr Marcus Winter (Si
emens) spoke on optimising the
configuration of powder diffractometers for pharmaceutical
applications. Of particular interest was a means of looking at
formulated tablets in-situ.</p>

<p>Dr Jamshed Anwar discussed pressure induced phase changes by
experiment and simulation. These experiments give an an insight
into the sensitivity and compressibility of formulated
tablets.</p>

<p>The afternoon session started with three short talks by Bob
Lancaster, Sue Staniforth, and Philip Lake (all Glaxo-W
ellcome).
They discussed the sensitivity of various drug molecules to
relative humidity and temperature.</p>

<p>The final lecture of the day was given by Robin Shirley
(University of Surrey), who demonstrated powder indexing software
and discussed the importance of indexing in the characterisation
of pharmaceutical polymorphs.</p>

<p>There followed a period of open discussion on a variety of
subjects including indexing, calibration, regulatory issues, and
how the instrument manufacturers can be
 more helpful to a
minority group in the field of XRPD.</p>

<p>The future of a group specialising in organic/pharmaceuticals
crystallography was aired. It was generally felt that the day was
an unqualified success and given the response and interest in the
meeting it was agreed that there should be more activity in the
area. It was also agreed that further such meetings should be
held under the auspices of the BCA.</p>

<h3><a name="strdat">I</a> - Structure &amp; Data</h3>

<p>The first lect
ure session, <strong>'Structure and
Data'</strong> complemented the Industrial Group organised 2-day
intensive short course run at the Conference on "Essential
Crystallography for Powder Diffraction Users" by Jeremy Cockroft,
(Birkbeck College, London).</p>

<p>X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAFS), as a complementary
technique to XRD was described by <strong>Neville
Greaves,</strong> (CCLRC Daresbury). Due to its ability to look
at local structure in liquids and amorphous materials in addition
to 
crystalline solids, and its element specific nature of
analysis (and low concentration levels detectable), XAFS is an
ideal complementary tool for the diffractionist. An example of
recrystallization of ion beam damaged silicon wafers was utilised
to show its ability to look at impurity level concentrations of
arsenic in silicon at the surface and in the bulk material.
Cordierite glass ceramics was another ideal example described
which illustrates the complementarity to XRD. Chromium oxide as a
nucle
ating agent in cordierite was studied by XAFS with X-Ray
diffraction and X-Ray Small Angle Scattering in an in-situ
experiment at temperatures to 1300 C. A pattern assigned to a
magnesium chromium oxide-magnesium aluminate spinel was
identified as the chromium intermediate.</p>

<p>An overview of the determination of a Single Crystal X-Ray
Structure using modern techniques was provided by
<strong>Marjorie Harding,</strong> (Liverpool University).
Provided a suitable quality crystal is available, a 
full
structural analysis using modern automated software and hardware,
is likely within 1-3 days. Some 15,000 such 'small molecule'
structures are published annually. New developments such as area
detectors, rotating anode generators and routine cryostatic
crystal cooling to 80K will speed throughput further, and allow
problem structures' (disorder, twinning, large molecules, small
crystals, etc.) to be further addressed.</p>

<p>An overview of modelling and display software for use in
crystallogr
aphy was provided by <strong>Robert Jackson,</strong>
(Keele University). With today's computing facilities, PC based
systems are often adequate whereas once only workstations were
employed for these techniques. The talk was fully illustrated
with molecular graphics output from a wide range of software
sources. The differing structural refinement approaches centred
on 'structural', or 'energy' based calculations were outlined.
Interatomic potentials are necessary for energy based refinement,
which i
s often the "best" technique if close to the result.
'Structural' based refinement using average bond lengths and
angles to predict structures shows some exciting possibilities.
Trial random structures are generated and a goodness of fit
factor calculated which takes into account penalties for
variations from averaged structures. The best fits can now be
'bred' to generate better refined structures. Examples from the
zeolite structures MAPO-36 and Na Zeolite Y, and lithium
ruthenate were used.</p>


<p>The main structural databases available to crystallographers
were described by <strong>Sharon Bellard,</strong> (Royal Society
of Chemistry). The philosophy behind all of the main structural
databases is similar. Comprehensive coverage of a well defined
subject area containing accurate information which has been
critically evaluated was stressed for all databases. The
accessibility was also described for each database, as formats
such as CD-ROM, on-line, and Internet enquiries are now
available
. The NRCC Metals Data File and the Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database, (inorganics), Cambridge Structural Database
(organic and organometallics) and ICDD-JCPDS (organics and
inorganics) and the Protein Database ('PDB' - biological
macromolecules) Databases were fully covered by the lecture.
(<em>Editor's note: you can get further information about any of
these database from links in the BCA home page on the World Wide
Web</em>).</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Jan Skakle,</strong> (Aberdeen University)
,
described the production of good quality XRD Data for submission
to the ICDD. Through the ICDD Grant in Aid program approximately
30 diffraction patterns per year are submitted by Aberdeen
University for inclusion in the JCPDS Database. All aspects from
the reason for analysis (new phase, re-examination of previous
data), through selection of standards (internal or external), to
indexing and lattice refinement were covered, along with
background information on JCPDS quality mark nomenclature and

criteria. <em>Tim Hyde, Johnson Matthey</em><br>

<h3><a name="prefor">II</a> - Preferred Orientation</h3>

<p>The Industrial Group plenary lecture was chaired by David
Dyson who introduced the speaker, <strong>Dr David
Dingley</strong> (Bristol University). The technique of
orientation imaging microscopy has been developed by Dr Dingley
and his collaborators in the USA, over the past few years. Dr
Dingley briefly reviewed its 
development and application before
describing the technique in detail. The principle involves the
collection of the diffraction pattern, produced from a sample in
the SEM, which results from the, largely elastic, backscattered
electrons. This clearly contains crystallite orientation
information for each point on the surface of the material and the
overall diffraction "image" describes the surface texture. The
key to the success of the technique, as far as the materials
scientist is concerned, arises
 from the sophisticated image
processing which Dr Dingley described in his talk. The basis of
this is a half-transformation of the diffraction image where a
matrix is constructed, the elements of which correspond to the
diffracted intensity at each pixel point. A sequence of look-up
tables are used to identify symmetry axes and eventually phase
identification. By setting thresholds, grain boundaries may be
identified and textures highlighted; in exceptional cases with a
resolution of 4nm. Dr Dingley
 then demonstrated the power of the
technique by a range of metallurgical examples - Al and Ni based
alloys, retained Austenite in steel and the partial
crystallisation of Ferrite. He emphasised the quantitative nature
of this approach; it can provide, instantly, colour-coded maps of
grain-size distributions and orientation distributions across a
metal surface. A consequence of this quantitative approach is
that the metallurgist needs to specify clearly what is meant by a
particular microstructural 
parameter.</p>

<p>The plenary was followed by a session of contributed papers on
the theme of "<strong>Preferred Orientation"</strong>. This
session carried forward some of the materials characterisation
issues raised during the plenary in the area of texture analysis,
with an emphasis on X-Ray diffraction techniques. The session was
chaired by <strong>Colin Small.</strong> The first two
contributors focused on experimental aspects, in particular on
methods of ensuring a good signal/noise ratio in
 pole figures and
subsequent orientation distribution functions.</p>

<p><strong>Erich Hovestreydt</strong> (Siemens Analytical)
described the "Hi-STAR" area detector system and its advantages
in texture analysis. This system is a compact, multiwire,
2-dimensional, position sensitive detector which offers good
spatial resolution (100gm) and a high speed of data acquisition.
He showed its benefits through a range of applications which
included induced strain in polypropylene under stress, the
textu
re and molecular orientation in wool fibres and highly
textured, deposited Cu layers.</p>

<p>This talk was followed by one from <strong>Dr A
Kinneging</strong> (Philips, Almelo) on the use of oscillation
methods in texture measurement. This approach aims to improve the
data quality obtained in the conventional Schulz method of data
acquisition, by oscillating the sample in order to increase the
crystal statistics. Various modes of oscillation were described
and evaluated. The optimum technique was
 concluded to be plane
parallel oscillation perpendicular to the diffracting planes
under linear X-Ray illumination. This maximises the surface area
from which diffracted rays are collected. The technique was
illustrated by an application to coarse grained aluminium.</p>

<p>It was the task of the next speaker, <strong>Dr David
Dyson</strong> (British Steel) to cover the interpretation of
X-Ray diffraction data, in the context of texture. The
semi-quantitative pole figure approach examines the orie
ntation
of a particular set of (hkl) planes. Clustering of points
indicates grains which are oriented in a similar fashion. There
are a range of standard pole figures for the various classical
textures found by the metallurgist. The rather more quantitative
approach of calculating and using orientation distribution
functions (o.d.f.) was then covered. This involves deducing the
rigorous relationship between the distribution of
crystallographic axes and the sample axes for the individual
crystallite
s in a material. The o.d.f. can be usefully employed
in following changes in texture resulting from mechanically and
thermally induced transformations in the material. Finally Dr
Dyson included a mention of the use of microscopy in texture
measurement and illustrated the power of this technique in
showing how grain textures blend together.</p>

<p>The remaining presentations indicated the diverse range of
materials exhibiting texture and texture-related properties.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Alun Bowen</s
trong> (DRA Farnborough) covered a
range of applications to engineering materials. He explained the
crucial links between microstructure and the processing,
properties and performance of a material. Dr Bowen explained the
difficulties in linking microstructural analysis to the
performance of structures of magnitude 102m. Such links could
benefit from a two-stage approach which included consideration of
the intermediate stage of fracture mechanics ( 10- 3m).Texture in
a product may be a good or bad f
actor; in particular the link
between texture and the elastic modulus of metallic engineering
materials is an important relationship. A useful monitor of
texture in this context is the volume fraction of basal poles
along the stress axis determined by X-Ray diffraction. This
correlates well with elastic modulus in a variety of materials,
including Ti alloys, and allows investigation of superplastic
strain. A similar approach has been used successfully in the
examination of vapour deposited Al alloys
 and in SiC composite Al
alloys. The link between texture and fatigue life for Ti:Al
alloys was illustrated. The talk concluded with a warning to
beware the gremlin pole figure!</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong>It is with great regret that I
have to report the death on 7 May 1996 of Alun Bowen at the age
of 51, so soon after giving this interesting talk. We shall miss
him. A full obituary will be published in a future issue of
'Crystallography News'.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>David Blunde
ll</strong> (ICI, Wilton) discussed the
determination of texture in polymeric materials, particularly in
PET fibres, sheet and bottle-shapes. the crystallite orientation
(within the amorphous matrix) may show one or two dimensional
characteristics and, once again, the link between texture and
elastic modulus was highlighted. Dr Blundell strongly recommended
the use of camera techniques in the initial investigation of
crystallite orientation followed by examination, via the Eulerian
cradle, of the su
btleties of texture displayed by pole figure
analysis. This was illustrated by the texture of a PET sheet
manufactured by two sequential drawing processes where the
preferred orientation of the polymer chain axes could be readily
determined. The manufacture of PET bottles involves simultaneous
deformation in two directions resulting in a different pole
figure and a consequent difference in its mechanical
properties.</p>

<p>The final talk was given by <strong>Derek Hart</strong> (GEC
Marconi) whos
e topic was the analysis of thin films in electronic
materials. The particular problem in question concerned oriented
coatings of PZT (PbZrO3-PbTiO3) on Pt:Si substrate. The PZT layer
is highly oriented but the electrical properties of the material
appeared to be uncorrelated with the texture, as determined by
X-Ray diffraction. TEM indicated the presence of microscopic
holes or bubbles as a result of heat treatment between the
sequential deposition of the PZT coating. STEM showed different
periodic
 concentration gradients for Zr and Ti throughout the
coating. However the story is still continuing ......</p>

<p>Before closing the session Colin Small thanked all the
speakers for their clear and relevant presentations which
contributed much to a well-organised and coherent session.</p>

<h2><a name="course">III</a> - Essential Crystallography
Course</h2>


<h3>Essential Crystallography for Industrial Powder Users</h3>

<p>It had long been felt that there was an unaddressed need for a
crystallography "primer" aimed at Industrial Powder Diffraction
Users, many of whom have used powder diffraction as an analytical
tool without having received formal training in crystallography.
The advent of modern goniometers and, above all, powerful
computers and software have opened up areas which require a
deeper understanding of the underlying principles of
crysta
llography (for example - Rietveld analysis). However, for
the average Industrial User, the time and opportunity to study
this for themselves is rarely available; the field of study does
not readily lend itself to unaided tuition and thus the concept
of a short course was born. The Industrial Group of the BCA were
fortunate in persuading Jeremy Cockroft to condense a several
weeks long undergraduate course into two and half days
concentrated study. Under Jeremy's inspired and enthusiastic
tutelage, i
t was an undeniable success with the course
participants rapidly assimilating the concepts and understanding
which will serve as the foundation for further study.</p>

<p>The course was split into four sessions, each of two lectures
of about one and a half hours, and was accompanied by a course
primer and a set of questions.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Session A</dt>

<dd>Concepts of a crystal, lattices and basic symmetry; the unit
cell and fractional coordinates, lattice planes and morphology.
The packing o
f atoms and molecules, the need for screw axes,
glide planes and inversion centres.</dd>

<dt>Session B</dt>

<dd>Concept of space groups, equivalent and special positions;
the International tables and how to use them. The concept of
diffraction, hkl indices, scattering from a 3D lattice, the Bragg
equation.</dd>

<dt>Session C</dt>

<dd>Concept of single crystal and powder diffraction experiments,
multiplicity, Laue symmetry, indexing and unit cell
determination. The concept of in- and out-of
 phase scattering,
systematic absences and reflection conditions, determination of
symmetry.</dd>

<dt>Session D</dt>

<dd>Concept of structure factor, reflection intensities, form
factors, geometric factors, the temperature factor. Concept of
structure refinement from both single crystal and powder data.
Information content available from different types of data.</dd>
</dl>

<p>How effective was the course? As a typical Industrial Powder
Diffraction User, I found the course stimulating, instru
ctive and
very well presented. I am one of those users (for 20years or so),
who have never had the time, or industrial need, or found the
right book to properly grasp the basic crystallographic concepts.
In this course these were presented in such a way as to make me
want to pursue a deeper understanding of the subject, and made me
feel that I could now attempt this with a minimum of confusion. A
worthwhile project, ably executed, and which we hope will be
repeated on a regular triennial basis.</p>


<p>As a mark of appreciation for Jeremy's efforts, Dave Taylor
made a presentation of a Teddy Bear ( for Jeremy's new baby girl
who arrived days before the course ) and a bottle of
non-crystalline material in liquid form, of suitable vintage, for
Jeremy and his wife to celebrate the new arrival.</p>

<h1><a name="Nov96">Autumn</a> Meeting 7 Nov 96</h1>

<h2>Crystallography in Industry</h2>

<p>The Industrial Group's Autumn Meeting was held on 7 November
1996 at AEA Technology, Harwell. Six papers were presented on the
theme of "Crystallography in Industry" and there were
presentations of two Industrial Group Awards. Participants were
welcomed to Harwell by Dr David Marsden, Ge
neral Manager of
Analytical Services at AEA Technology.</p>

<p>Other speakers were:<br>
</p>

<p>Mike Johnson (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) described the
ENGIN time-of-flight diffractometer which uses a pulsed neutron
source. He gave examples of measurements made to establish the
capabilities of the technique and results of first measurements
made.</p>

<p>Bob Cernik (CLRC Daresbury) explained plans for the expansion
of the Materials Characterisation Service using powder
diffraction and EX
AFS. Industrial customers will be able to enter
into contracts for the purchase of beam time and analysis with
production of confidential reports for the customer.</p>

<p>Keith Rogers (Cranfield University) reported on xrd and ion
beam analyses of the intermediate layer in CdTe-CdS solar cells.
Such cells are a viable alternative to silicon cells and it is
believed that their efficiency is affected by an optically
absorbing, non-stoichiometric layer at the interface.</p>

<p>Graham McPherson (ZEN
ECA Specialities, Blackley) spoke on the
role of xrd techniques in the study of polymorphism and outlined
the strengths and weaknesses of powder and single crystal
methods. He went on to discuss the successful use of a new
molecular modelling technique (to be published) to elucidate
large molecule crystal packing.</p>

<p>Bob Pendlebury (ICI R &amp; T Centre, Middlesbrough) reviewed
the importance of full characterisation of the structure of
polymeric materials and the need to relate this to chemis
try,
processing conditions and final properties. He explained the use
of small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), made comparisons between
this technique and the complementary ones of xrd and electron
microscopy and discussed the benefits and disadvantages of SAXS
as an analytical technique for polymeric materials.</p>

<p>For the last technical paper, David Taylor (Chairman of the
Industrial Group) presented preliminary findings from the UK
Intensity Round Robin exercise, carried out in collaboration 
with
the ICDD. The complete results from the exercise will be reviewed
during the Instrument Sensitivity Clinic that the Group has
organised for the 1997 Spring Meeting of the BCA.</p>

<h2><a name="award96">Industrial</a> Group Awards</h2>

<p>During the Meeting, there were two presentations of Industrial
Group Awards, made in recognition of sustained contributions to
industrial crystallography. The first (a Beevers model of spinel)
was made to <strong>Brian Bellamy</strong> who had retired
rece
ntly from AEA Technology. In presenting the Award to Brian,
David Taylor referred to Brian's long career at Harwell during
which he had made many contributions, both technical and
managerial, to the work that had established the Analytical
Services group as a widely recognised centre of excellence. Brian
had played a major part in establishing both the BCA and the
Industrial Group: he had served on the IG committee from 1983 to
1989 as well as being a member of the Council of the BCA.</p>
