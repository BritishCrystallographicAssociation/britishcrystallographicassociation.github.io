Dear XRPD Phase ID Workshop delegate,

Thank you for registering for this workshop at the BCA Spring Meeting.
The sessions start at 9 am in ROOM ??? of the Faraday building next to the 
conference centre.

Please note that some session times differ from those published in 
Crystallography News and are:
09:00 - 10:30
11:00 - 12:00
13:00 - 15:00
15:30 - 17:15 (Note this session officially ends at 17:15 to coincide with 
the start of the Exhibitor Forum. However, the computer room is available 
until 17:30 for anyone needing more time on worked examples)

The computer technicians at Lancaster have been working on the 2005 PDF4+ 
installation that we will use in the afternoon session for several weeks and 
we await confirmation that they have been successful.
To ensure that you get the best opportunity to work with the database, you 
may prefer to bring your own laptop and have a 30 day trial of the database 
installed for use in the workshop and back at base for the remainder of the 
30 day trial period.

You must have administrator privilege to install the database and the laptop 
must meet the following preferred computer specifications:

* SVGA monitor with 1024 x 768 resolution; 96 dpi display setting
* Microsoft® Windows® NT 4.0 SP6 or later, 2000 SP3 or later, XP 
Professional SP2 or later
* NTFS file system
* Pentium processors : 2 GHz or faster
* 512 MB of memory
* 4 GB of free hard-disk space
* Mouse
* CD/DVD-ROM drive
XML output is offered as an optional feature in this product; Internet 
Explorer 6.0 or greater is needed for this feature.

Full details for the PDF4+ installation are given in a 293kb Adobe PDF file 
that can be downloaded from:
http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/bca/ig/dloads/PDF4.pdf   - this is the leaflet 
distributed with the installation CD's.

Please inform us by the end of this week if you intend to bring a laptop for 
a 30 day trial installation in a reply to this message.

We look forward to meeting you next week.

Dave Taylor (for the organisers)
