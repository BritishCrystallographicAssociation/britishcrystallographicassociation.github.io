A new BSI standard for the analysis of glass making sands.<br>
<i><small>BSI provide organisations from all sectors of industry with best 
practice solutions and standards that represent and support the needs of 
business and society in the UK and worldwide. The Society of Glass Technology 
work with BSI to ensure that British, European and international standards are 
relevant to the needs of the glass industry. Many glassworks do not have 
analytical facilities "in-house" and appoint an external laboratory. 
Furthermore, for those glassworks that are part of an international group, 
analytical facilities may vary from tried and tested "wet" methods to 
automated instrumentation. It is therefore important to ensure that the 
industry has a framework for an overall approach for the production and 
management of analytical systems and that defined and consistent nomenclature 
is available to avoid confusion. 
<br>
This presentation will give an overview of a new standard method for the 
analysis of glass making sands by XRF, and where appropriate, ICP-OES, UV-VIS, 
AAS and combustion techniques. </small></i>

<p><b>11:30 John Boyle</b>, University of Liverpool.<br>
Geochemical analysis of lake sediment cores by XRF.<br>
<i><small>Geochemical analysis of lake sediment cores by XRF presents some special challenges. 
For high resolution studies little sediment is available, so sample size is small 
and non destructive (loose powder) approaches are preferred, restricting the 
accuracy and precision of the measurements.  Furthermore, rapid and extreme 
stratigraphic change in matrix type is common in lake sediment records, 
requiring approaches to matrix effect and overlap correction, and to calibration, 
that are as generalised as possible. Finally, lake sediments are highly 
heterogeneous such that reliable characterisation depends as much on sample 
number as on the precision of individual measurements. This talk presents the 
approach we have developed at Liverpool, illustrating it using a number of case studies.</small></i>

Trace elements analyses of liquid and semi liquid hazardous waste by WD XRF <br>
<i><small>Indaver Ireland Ltd., a total waste management company, officially opened it&rsquo;s 
new Solvent Recovery Facility (SRF) last year. This new waste solvent blending 
module allows wastes of different calorific value to be blended, to achieve an 
optimum value. The blended waste solvent can be used as a fuel in cement factories 
when the acceptance criteria of the outlet facility are met.<br>
Each incoming and outgoing load containing waste is submitted to thorough 
analyses, where WDXRF S4 Pioneer plays an indispensable role. By use of simple 
sample preparation it is possible to perform fast critical trace elements 
determination prior to blending and during the blending process, in order to 
meet demanding criteria of required fuel specification.</small>

<p><b>14:00 Prof. Graham Martin</b>, Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
Heritage and XRF - unlikely companions?<br>
<i><small>The heritage sector is not one of those areas of application for XRF 
that immediately springs to mind. However, distributed around the world in 
something like 15 different location from The State Hermitage, St Petersburg, 
The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, the British Museum and through to 
the V&amp;A XRF finds many areas of use in heritage.<br>

The presentation will overview the present XRF system at the V&amp;A and illustrate the use with example.
 </small>

<p><b>14:30 Owen Butler </b>, Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), Buxton.<br>
and <b>Elke Adriaenssens </b>,Vlaamse Millieumaatschappij (VMM), Antwerp, Belgium.<br>
Analysis of heavy metals in suspended airborne particles collected on filter papers by XRF techniques.<br>
<i><small>This joint presentation will describe the use of XRF in a regulatory environment 
for the analysis of air filter samples. In the first half of the presentation, 
Owen will initially present an overview of procedures used at HSL to present 
paper filter samples to their instrumentation. He will then describe some 
ongoing work to generate and certify new instrument calibration filters samples. 
Elke will then describe ongoing work at VMM, the Flemish Environmental Agency, 
where XRF techniques are used to monitor airborne heavy metal pollution in 
ambient air. Owen will conclude the presentation by outlining XRF 
developments in this measurement arena.
