<p><i>Note: This report is reproduced from June 2008 Crystallography News</i>.<br>
After some caffeine and a biscuit <strong>G&eacute;rard Coquerel</strong> proved that 
a hydrate can be much more of a Jekyll than a Hyde when used as a racemate resolution in modafinil.
In this system R/S resolution was only possible in the presence of water, 
with knowledge of the ternary phase space.
This knowledge, G&eacute;rard proved, he and his group have in spades.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Kennedy's</strong> first port of call displayed the potential perils of spellcheckers, 
as Mony a Meikel Maks a Muckel (many small things make a large thing) 
transformed into Mock Turtles. He followed by giving experimentalists something 
to feel ashamed of as he showed the lack of large scale systematic studies within organic salts.
He then went on to explain his experimental methodology of using a 'simplified' 
molecule as a means of building up a databank to allow structure-property prediction, 
showing there are feasible alternatives to writing code.</p>
<p><strong>Royston Copley</strong> then finished the session displaying the hydration of Carvediol, 
a racemic molecule that clearly did not want to behave, requiring SSNMR data and 
the crystal structure of the R enatiomer to understand the disorder present in 
the racemate. Also shown in this talk was the interesting hydration dehadration 
behavior of the single enantiomer, displaying  the power of optical microscopy 
when combined with a secondary technique and a generous helping of logical thought. </p>

<p><b>Industrial Group Young Crystallographers Prize Talk</b><br>
<i><b>High Pressure Structural Studies of Energetic Materials<br>
Ian Oswald,</b> University of Edinburgh</i><br><br>

Ian began by saying that energetic materials release heat and / or gaseous 
products at a high rate on a certain stimulas e.g. heat, impact. Energetic 
materials are found in pyrotechnics (fireworks), gas generators (car air bags), 
propellants (rockets) and explosives (mining, quarrying).  The materials are 
classed as being either primary or secondary where mild or strong stimuli 
(longer shock wave) respectively are required. In general, the requirement 
is to find the most dense polymorph. Ian discussed high pressure studies of 
the beta polymorph (one of four) of HMX. At high pressure there are phase 
transitions and changes in the intermolecular interactions and molecular 
geometries. There is a requirement to effectively model the performance of 
HMX. Structural information is often not available under the extreme conditions 
of detonation. The usual approach is to use a Diamond Anvil Cell. However, 
Ian described his work using a Paris-Edinburgh Cell on 'Pearl-Hips'. A load 
is applied and a pressure generated. 
<br><br>
Ian went on to describe his work on RDX - a widely used military explosive 
containing nitro groups. Previous X-ray studies had identified an alpha to 
gamma phase transition in which its space group, Pbca, didn't change. The 
molecules retain the same conformation but the nitro-group twist (changes 
in the torsional angles). Powder Neutron Diffraction shows that all the 
d-spacings contract, due to the pressure, and that Pbca is not the correct 
space group. As a result of this new information attention turned to single 
crystal X-ray work - bay 162 at Daresbury. There were 17 data collections 
and the gamma structure was solved. The space group was found to be Pca21. 
There are two molecules with different conformations and there are changes 
in volume and density for the alpha and gamma polymorphs of RDX. In conclusion, 
Ian said that a combination of modern high pressure techniques can provide 
detailed structural information of energetic materials.

<i><b>Direct Correlation between Ferrite Microstructure and Electrical Resistivity<br>
Judith Shackleton,</b> University of Manchester</i><br><br>

Ferrites are used for transformer cores and operate at ever increasing 
frequencies. Magnesium-zinc ferrites are toroid shaped. Their density is 
93% of theoretical. Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM) - Energy Dispersive 
Spectroscopy (EDS) shows only a single phase with less zinc at the surface. 
X-ray Diffraction shows them to be single phase spinels with space group Fd3m. 
Judith went on to show the results obtained from Tomographic Energy Dispersive 
Imaging (TEDDI) which produces 3D scans of the lattice parameters calculated 
using the Le Bail full pattern method (TOPAS software). The lattice parameters 
were found to be larger on the outside of the samples. Remote Electron Beam 
Induced Current (REBIC), a conductance mode SEM measurement, was used to 
measure electrical properties. However, no sharp features were detected. 
Resistivity measurements were also carried out and the variation in resistivity 
found to be about 10 ohm/cm over a length of approximately 800 microns. This is 
a similar length scale to that found by TEDDI.  
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Protein Structures in Drug Discovery - from Fragments to Macromolecules<br>
Judit Debreczeni,</b> Astra Zeneca</i><br><br>

Judit began by saying protein crystallography is one of the most powerful 
experimental techniques to aid the design and development of drug molecules 
in the pharmaceutical industry. It has been able to adapt to the ever-changing 
needs of the business, shifting focus on different drug targets and approaches. 
High throughput environments produce automation of as many steps as possible to 
solve structure. Robots are used for crystallisation and also for the 
crystallography e.g. crystal screening and data collection. High impact areas 
are studies for protein-ligand, protein-fragment and protein-protein interactions. 
Crystallography has become a widely used technique to identify small building 
blocks, fragments of potential drug compounds. 
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Applications of X-ray Diffraction and Mapping in the Glass Industry<br>
Mark Farnworth</b>, Pilkington Group Limited</i> 

Mark began by saying that glass is not traditionally thought of as a good 
material for analysis by XRD. However, the glass making raw materials and the 
refractory materials that make up parts of the Float Glass Process are 
crystalline and their nature needs to be understood. In addition, many of the 
ultra-thin coatings deposited onto glass are also crystalline. Mark described 
how the non-crystalline (or glassy) content of refractory material is determined 
using a set of standards with known glassy phase concentrations - mixtures of 
fused silica a quartz. The background counts at 24 degrees 2-theta are measured 
and used to construct a calibration line for the determination of unknowns. <br><br>

Thin layers of material deposited onto glass can be very crystalographically 
oriented (texture). Mark showed how he uses pole-figure measurements to 
determine the strength of Ag(111) columnar orientation in thin silver layers. 
In conclusion, Mark described how XRD maps are obtained from 10cm x 10cm coated 
glass plates. Careful set-up and positioning is required and particular 
consideration is required to determine the sample displacement errors at 
each map position. For a selected bragg reflection, maps of peak area 
(a function of texture and layer thickness), peak position (a function of strain) 
and peak FWHM (a function of crystallite size) can be measured.   
</p>

<p><i><b>Application of X-ray Diffraction and other Analytical Techniques to Pharmaceuticals<br>
Suzanne Harte,</b> SAFC Pharmorphix</i><br><br>

Suzanne explained that it is essential that their customers gain a thorough 
understanding of the solid state properties of their potential drug candidates 
in order to develop them in to successful marketable pharmaceuticals. To reach 
this point a wide range of complementary analytical techniques are used. By 
utilizing thermal, optical, spectroscopis and diffraction methods it is possible 
to gain a much greater comprehension of pharmaceuticals than can be achieved 
from one isolated technique. When a material first arrives spectroscopic Nuclear 
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is used. High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC) 
assesses purity and Acqueous Thermodynamic Soloubility in water. A D8 GADDS 
instrument is used as a screening tool - 96 well plate. Suzanne explained is 
a reliable method for identifying different forms of materials and single 
crystal XRD for confirming structure and determining the absolute stereochemistry 
of chiral compounds for regulatory submission. 
</p>
<p><i><b>Application of X-ray Diffraction Within Forensic Science<br>
David Rendle</b> (ICDD), Visiting Fellow (Cranfield Forensic Institute)</i><br><br>

David began by saying that XRD has been used in forensic science laboratories 
around the world since before the middle of the last century. Its use sixty 
years ago was generally restricted to basic qualitative analysis. Modern day 
applications have the added advantages of the availability of high speed 
computer-controlled diffractometers, data processing software enabling 
quantitative analysis and commercial databases of powder patterns with 
search and match routines. <br><br>

There are three aspects to any type of forensic instrumental analysis, 
namely identification, comparison and intelligence gathering. Identification 
is a given, whereas comparison may not always be necessary. Intelligence 
gathering - the recording and collation of detailed analytical results in a 
database - whilst time-consuming and tedious, is essential to the forensic 
scientist for estimating the significance of the results and for indicating 
trends over a period of time. <br><br>

XRD is non-destructive, versatile, identifies compounds, can analyse mixtures 
and large or small samples. David concluded by saying the analysis of street 
drug seizures by XRD yields not just the identity of the drug, but also the 
identities of the adulterants or excipients used to dilute the drug.

<p><i><b>Powder Diffraction of Nanomaterials<br>
Stephen Norval</b>, Intertek MSG</i><br><br>

Stephen began by saying that, for the most part, techniques for phase 
identification, quantification, microstructure, in-situ monitoring etc 
are well established and were applied for decades before "nano" became 
fashionable. Heterogeneous catalysts are good examples of nanomaterials 
that have been around longer than X-ray Diffraction. Adsorbants and pigments 
were also being used before the nano-revolution. New age nano-materials include 
nanoclays and oxides that give special properties to nano-composites. Nano-oxides 
are increasingly used in sunblocks. Nanometals are important in fabricating ever 
smaller electronic components and biologically active materials are being applied 
on nano-oxide supports. For a material to be described as 'nano' the crystal size 
in at least one direction is generally considered to be less than 100 nanometres. <br><br>

Stephen presented information about rutile titania, commonly used as a pigment 
in many materials. Crystallite size distributions determine its physical nature 
for example 'white' pigment is usually ¼ micron in size whereas for sun-block 
(scatters UV light) the pigment is approximately 25 nm. Nano-composite clays 
have enhanced mechanical properties and usually contain montmorillonite clays. 
Clay triple layers are loosely independent and weakly held together. XRD can 
be used to look at orientation effects.
</p>

<p><i><b>X-ray In-Plane Scattering of GaN Nano-columns<br>
Christopher Staddon,</b> University of Nottingham</i><br><br>

Gallium nitride is a wide band gap semi-conductor and is used in blue emission 
lasers, high density storage media and high power FET's. Chris said that a 
major problem with this material is the lack of suitable substrates, which in 
turn results in high defect densities in the material and hence less than ideal 
devices. To avoid this problem, isolated GaN nano-rods are grown by molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) on sapphire substrates using aluminium nitride buffer layers 
of appropriate thickness. <br>
The nano-columns have a typical height of approximately 1 micron and lateral 
dimensions of approximately 30 to 100 nanometres and have hexagonal cross-sections.  
Chris said that he has used a PANalytical MRD instrument, configured for in-plane 
scattering, to determine the mean value of the in-plane lateral dimensions, 
orientation and quality of the GaN nano-columns. The experimental data was 
collected from two independent in-plane reflections -  (200) and (300). A 
bi-modal size distribution was discovered. The results were similar to those 
obtained with from Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron 
Microscope (TEM) images of similar samples.  </p>

<p><i><b>Solving Crystal Structures of Zeolites using Powder Diffraction and 
Electron Crystallography<br>
Chris Gilmore,</b> University of Glasgow</i><br><br>

Chris discussed zeolite structures and the challenges involved in solving them, 
particularly in early stages of synthesis and characterisation when samples are 
poorly characterised. The crystallite sizes are often so small that peak 
broadening makes the powder patterns hard to deconvolute. Often they become 
nanometre sized so that only electron diffraction can be used to solve them.<br><br>

Chris has used techniques that use density building functions and density 
histogram matching to solve a number of structures ab-initio using both electron 
diffraction data in 2- and 3- dimensions and powder data. The programs he uses 
are FOCUS and TOPAS. A  low resolution structure is first generated using 
structure factors and more direct methods. New reflections are given permuted 
phase angles (and intensities if overlapped). They are analysed using density 
building functions. The optimal phase sets are subjected to entropy maximisation 
and then likelihood and density histograms are used to select the optimal phase sets.

<p><i><b>Analysis of Weld Residual Stresses in Prototype Engineering Components 
and Structures using Pulsed Neutrons<br>
Supriyo Ganguly, </b>Open University, Milton Keynes</i><br><br>

Suprivo began by saying weld stresses can result in fatique so there is a 
requirement to investigate damage tolerance. This has been carried out 
through the WELDES project. Welding is probably more cost effective than 
traditional riveting. The factors which control fatique initiation and crack 
growth are well known but it is important to understand the actual crack 
growth mechanism. <br><br>

Two aluminium alloys have been investigated: 2024-T351 (lower wing material, 
design toughness limited) and 7150-T651 (upper wing material, design buckling 
limited). Wing structures are machined and welded. The size and measured density 
define the appropriate residual stress measurement that is used. Time-of-Flight 
Diffraction with a 14-40 millisec range and Pulsed Neutron Strain Scanning are 
techniques that have been used. Suprivo concluded by saying neutron diffraction 
has successfully been performed on prototype samples.   
</p>

<p><i><b>Residual Stress Measurements of gas turbines components by X-Ray Diffraction<br>
George Bibby,</b> Rolls Royce</i><br><br>

Residual Stress measurements are made to effect the quality control in material 
supply. They are used to assess the 'equivalence' for process change in 
manufacturing and investigate the condition of material after rig tests and 
service running. There is a requirement to both measure the surface and measure 
depth profiles through components. George went on to discuss the method of 
manufacture of cast / wrought discs and the architecture of gas turbines. 
They have a dedicated residual stress analyser and a prototype residual 
stress analyser which can take up to 300lbs in weight. They have analysed 
low pressure compressor blades, high pressure turbine discs and engine mounts. 
Components can be immersed in hydrofluoric acid to remove surface material prior 
to analysis. Sources of error include 'psi splitting' due to the presence of 
'out of phase' shear forces and shadowing due to material on the sample that 
impinges the diffraction cones. Both large and heavy components can be measured 
by XRD although bulk residual stress is best measured by other techniques. 
George concluded by saying that providing the methodology is right then X-ray 
diffraction is a very satisfactory method for measuring residual stress. </p>

<p><i><b>JEEP: The Joint Engineering, Environmental and Processing Beamline at Diamond Light Source<br>
Michael Drakopoulos </b>  Diamond Light Source Limited</i><br><br>

Advances in engineering disciplines are often driven by development of new 
materials, but also by incremental progress of existing technology. In both 
cases, reliability and reproducibility of results are key. Michael informed 
everyone that Diamond Light Source is constructing a beamline dedicated to 
Engineering Science to become operational by October 2009. It will be the first 
engineering beamline in the UK. The beamline will focus on diffraction and 
imaging-based methods for the study of structural properties of engineering 
materials in static and dynamic conditions. Imaging and tomography establish 
a picture of structural properties on the microscopic scale. With diffraction 
they will study atomic structure to reveal strain, crystallographic phases and 
microstructure. <br><br>

To penetrate deep into engineering materials, JEEP will provide synchrotron 
radiation at X-ray energies between 50keV and 115keV (0.28 to 0.08 angstroms). 
The attenuation length for iron is a few millimetre at 3x the attenuation length 
the signals are still strong so measurement through 1cm of steel will be possible. 

There are going to be a number of challenges e.g. there will be a high flux at 
high energies so heat management will is important. Michael showed everyone the 
layout of the experimental hutch of the 'internal' beamline. The external 
building will be able to take samples up to 2 tons in weight. There will be 
up to five different detectors which will include an Energy Dispersive 
multi-element detector and a high energy 2D detector for imaging. High energy,  
Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) will also be available.

<b>Industrial Group Plenary Lecture - Wed 9th April  <br>
<i>X-ray Diffraction on Mars<br>
Rob Delhez</i></b><i> - Delft University of Technology</i><br><br>

Rob began by posing the question - Why space research? This may be for curiosity 
or scientific interest in many fields e.g. Does life exist in the universe? 
How was the universe created? He went on to explain that if there is life in 
space we need to find organic molecules. 
Hunankind has found 150 molecular species in the space environment, 230 including 
isotopes. Of these, 50 species have been found in comets. For meteorites 
approximately 3% of the mass is organic of which 20% is soluble and 80% is 
kerogene. 

Rob then posed another question - Why Mars? Mars is the closest planet to 
Earth and has a history similar to that of Earth. It has a very elliptical 
orbit around the Sun. Its rotational period is 1.02597 days and its orbital 
period is 669.6 Mars days (or 687 Earth days). Unlike the Earth, Mars has no 
tectonic plates and no magnetic field and its surface contains material that 
is 'only' 4 billion years old (the Earth is 4.5 billion years old). Its surface 
temperature is 0 to -15C during the day and approximately -85C at night. Since 
Mars is smaller than the Earth, its gravity is less, 0.36 of that of the Earth. 
Its oxidising atmosphere is mainly carbon dioxide. If there are dust storms then 
carbon dioxide and water containing ice will form on dust which will produce 
lightening. If no dust storms then there should be clouds of carbon dioxide 
and water. <br><br>

A further question was: What do we already know? Meteorites have provided 
evidence for minerals, gasses and organics. Mars Landers have told us about 
the atmosphere and temperatures. Orbiters have provided pictures and 3D images 
(visible, ultra-violet, infra-red, spectroscopy, magnetic) of the surface. They 
have provided evidence of land slides, dust storms and clouds.<br><br>

Rob showed everyone a picture of the Gusev Crater and Ma'adim Vallis. A picture 
of Dao Vallis was also shown. Sub-surface and surface flows created the outflow 
channel. Water related minerals are present as detected by spectral (infra-red) 
and magnetic imaging. This would be a good site for carrying out X-ray Diffraction. <br><br>

Rob went on to describe what is happening in the near future. There is going to 
be a Mars Science Lab. It will contain X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Fluorescence 
instruments. The mission has several goals including the search for life, climate 
and geology investigation and human exploration. The prototype lab, called Chemin, 
was tested in Death Valley, United States, in 2004. A paper was published - 
Powder Diffraction 20(2) June 2005, 128-133.
The lab is portable, weighing only 15kg. However, the actual lab needs to be 
lighter by a factor of 2 or 3. The XRD instrument has a micro-focus X-ray tube 
with a cobalt anode producing a spot size of 50 micrometres. A novel sample 
vibration system allows analysis of coarse grained samples. The energy 
consumption is 15Whours per analysis. <br><br>

There is also the Aurora program which has a number of robotic missions planned. 
In addition, there is the ExoMars program. For this, the mission objectives are 
entry, descent, landing, surface mobility via a rover and access to the sub-surface 
using a drill which will penetrate down to 2m. We were shown a photograph of the 
ExoMars rover. It is the size of a mini-Cooper! <br><br>

Projects are also planned to investigate organic materials. Some minerals/structures 
are formed by algae e.g. barded iron formation (BIF) and stromatolites 
(calcium carbonates). Stromatolites have been found at Shark Bay, Australia. 
Other minerals can host organic molecules e.g. iron hydroxides and clay minerals 
that have large internal surfaces. Expanding clay minerals include Smectite 
(medium charge layers) and Vermiculite (high charge layers). Some minerals can 
absorb positively charged species onto their internal surfaces e.g. amino acids). <br><br>

Rob went on to explain some of the requirements of a Mars XRD instrument. 
The dimensions would need to be 220x60x120mm, a mass of 0.8 kg and a maximum 
power of 2W. For 'space qualification', it would need to withstand accelerations 
up to 40g and vacuum of 10-14 bar.   The instrument would need to be sterilised 
before launch. Camera-type diffraction is required and the diffractometer would 
need to have no moving parts. For the X-ray source, there are two options: a 
radioactive source in which radiation protection would need to be built in or 
a tube where high voltage risks would need to be considered. The detector would 
need to be a 2D position sensitive detector and it would need to be energy sensitive.  <br><br>

The presentation was excellent and illustrated a very practical application of 
X-ray Diffraction at the forefront of science and technology.  <br><br>
