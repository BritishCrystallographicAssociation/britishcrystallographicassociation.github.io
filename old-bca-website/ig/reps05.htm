<h3>In Situ: Processing in Industry.</h3>
<p>This session aimed to present some applications of diffraction
to the study of real industrial processing systems where the
in-situ approach has given an essential insight for understanding
and development.</p>
<p><em>"Surfactant Formulation"</em><br>
<strong>Gordon Tiddy</strong> (University of Manchester) gave
an amusing talked based on many years of experience at Unilever.
He covered chemical details of detergents and fabric conditioners
and their complex phase transitions. The trend to washing clothes
at lower temperatures gives interesting scientific challenges.
There were tips on differentiating between 'money well spent' and
'PR hype'.</p>
<p><em>"Processing block co-polymers for nano-pores"</em><br>
<strong>Geoff Moggridge</strong> (University of Cambridge)
spoke about work to try and make polymer membranes for
separation. The aim is high volume fraction mondisperse pores
~1-10nm. The route is phase separation in block copolymers to
give aligned cylinders which can then be etched away to leave the
filter. Techniques for study include X-ray diffraction under
shear.</p>
<p><em>"In Situ Crystallisation Studies of Pharmaceutical Materials"</em><br>
<strong>Simon Jacques</strong> (University College London)
described the use of TEDDI (Tomographic Energy Dispersive
Diffraction Imaging) at Daresbury to follow in-situ
crystallisation of pharmaceutical materials. A white beam is
collimated to illuminate a relatively small volume (~50&micro;m),
the sample is then scanned in x, y and z to build up a 3-D image
and the scattered radiation can be analysed with respect to
diffraction, fluorescence and/or absorption. The technique is
still being developed. Other related applications include maps of
different crystalline phases in tablets.</p>

<h3>Crystallography in Industry 1 &amp; 2</h3>
<p>Fist published in Crystallography News - June 2005</p>
<p>Wednesday's afternoon session "Crystallography in industry"
was chaired by <b>Judith Shackleton</b> and opened with
<b>Michael Preuss</b> (University of Manchester) lecturing on
<b><i>'Residual stresses in friction welded aeroengine
components'.</i></b> He talked about the types of friction
welding: friction welding has the advantage over fusion processes
which cannot reliably weld many of the high temperature alloys
now found in aero engine components:</p>
<p>the inertia friction method is used to join discs/shafts and
the linear friction method for joining blades onto discs. A
consideration during friction welding however is the generation
of residual stress, during joining, and stress relief during post
weld heat treatment. Industry has turned to synchrotron high
energy dispersive X-ray scattering to enable researchers to
undertake systematic studies of the residual stress profiles in
welds and improve the understanding of how welding parameters and
post weld heat treatments affect the residual stress fields and
the performance of the welded component. The talk was concluded
with the fact that higher temperatures for annealing brings down
stresses to acceptable levels.</p>
<p><b>Tony Fry</b> (National Physical Laboratory) followed with
his lecture on <b><i>'Residual stress measurements at NPL.
Increasing confidence and development best practice'</i></b> in
which he talked about the parameter study to find how robust the
x-ray diffraction method is. He went through two projects
undertaken at the NPL and ended with mention of the Good Practice
Guide authored with the Projects Industrial Advisory Group. The
talk ended with a good discussion from delegates in the room.</p>
<p><b>Martijn Fransen</b> (PANalytical) ended this first session
with an enthusiastic lecture on <b><i>'The problem of sample
fluorescence when dealing with transition metals in industrial
samples'.</i></b> The talk covered 1 -D and 2-D detection systems
and posed the question "Can you get good peak/ background ratio?"
He went through the best choices of the practical aspects from
the monchromator to the detector as a function of the elemental
composition of the sample.</p>
<p>The second part of the session, chaired by <b>Richard
Morris,</b> opened with <b>Peter Laggner</b> (Graz, Austria) on
<b><i>Bridging the nano-gap: simultaneous SAXS and XPD on
nanomaterials.</i></b> He covered a lot in his talk giving a
range of examples such as synthesis of mesoporous materials and
dissolution of drug-delivery C/R microspheres. He focused on the
design of the HECUS-System3 SWAXS (small and wide angle x-ray
scattering) and its use in different applications. The need for
SAX for determining domain size and surface roughness and XPD for
crystal structure and amorphous content was explained.</p>
<p>The session was brought to an end with a interesting lecture
from <b>lan Cope</b> (Imperial College), lan explained his PhD
research: <b><i>Using XRD to support the study of an iron oxide
deposit,</i></b> called the Pic de Fon deposit. This deposit is a
potential new source of iron ore located in the Eastern Republic
of Guinea, West Africa. The aim is to combine XRD and geochemical
analysis to constrain the process by which banded iron formation
is converted to iron ore.</p>
<p>It was good because as a field geologist he knew little about
XRD, but was interested in how it could help in his research. XRD
results indicate that distinct crystallographic signature may
exist for the different ore grade material types. Each ore-grade
material type exhibits different physical properties, hard,
biscuit and powder, which in turn will control the metallurgical
performance of the final delivered product.</p>
<p>All the presentations gave a useful insight into where and how
crystallography is used in industry and the different type of
demands industry places on crystallographic hardware compared to
academia.</p>

<h3>Non-ambient Pharmaceutical Studies 1 &amp; 2</h3>
<p><b>Jonathan Burley</b> opened this session, chaired by <b>Anne
Kavanagh</b> with <b><i>Crystal structure and intermolecular
forces from variable temperature PXRD</i></b><i>.</i> The
structure was that of Glipizide, a major drug for treating
diabetes. Variable temperature data were used to confirm the
index of the cell, and Jonathan recommended this as a facile
method of ensuring crystals are correctly indexed when using
powder diffraction. Since structure-property relationships are of
interest, he investigated intermolecular forces quantitatively by
working out the Debye temperatures along the cell axes. This
temperature is a measure of the lattice stiffness, i.e. bond
strength. The anisotropic lattice expansion was fitted to the sum
of phonon modes. Jonathan showed that glipizide has single phonon
modes along the <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> axes, which he attributed
to &pi;-&pi; interactions and hydrogen bonding respectively, and
the <i>b</i> axis is characterised by two phonon modes, which
correspond to van der Waals interactions and steric
interlock.</p>
<p>For a patent, every pharmaceutical requires characterization;
this is often achieved, at least in part, by powder diffraction.
One of the questions <b>Jeremy Cockcroft</b> considered in his
talk <i>Obtaining <b>accurate non-ambient laboratory PXRD data
for pharmaceutical studies</b></i> was whether the powder
diffraction patterns always represent a polymorph of the
material. In order to answer this, accurate data are required,
ideally without preferred orientation. To get good data, the
diffractometer configuration has to be considered and the
calibration of the equipment checked. Low temperature diffraction
is often a useful tool, providing turbulence, draughts and icing
problems can be dealt with. LT work requires capillary geometry,
which has the advantage of reducing or removing preferred
orientation. Several case studies were presented</p>
<p><b>Steve Cosgrove</b> finished the first session with
<b><i>Probing (De)Hydration Behaviour by High Resolution X-ray
Powder Diffraction.</i></b> He described studies of a candidate
drug, as its sodium salt, which was known to crystallise as four
polymorphs, three hydrates and a number of other solvates. Steve
discussed DSC and derivative TGA for probing dehydration and
hydration of the compound. Mass spectrometry is also used, with
monitoring of the <i>m/z</i> = 18 peak indicating the loss of
water from the compound. Dynamic vapour sorption is also used to
cycle the compound within various humidity environments to
monitor moisture sorption and dehydration. This method can
highlight stable higher hydrates, which would be more appropriate
for manufacture as the risk of water sorption by a lower hydrate
would cause problems during weighing stages.</p>
<p>After the coffee break, <b>Roy Copley</b> took the chair, and
<b>Francesca Fabbiani</b> spoke <b>on <i>Probing Polymorphism
with High Pressure</i></b> based on a search for high pressure
polymorphs of piracetam. Varying of pressure adds an additional
dimension to the search for polymorphs of pharmaceuticals. Three
approaches are available - direct compression (best for very
small molecules), growth of crystals from the melt and
recrystallisation from solution under pressure. Three new
polymorphs of piracetam have been structurally characterised.
Francesca used graph set analysis to demonstrate the differences
in the hydrogen bonding patterns within the polymorphs, and also
introduced the concept of Hirschfeld surfaces to differentiate
between the polymorphs.</p>
<p>Emphasising the importance, and often difficulty, of
understanding polymorphs and hydrates of pharmaceuticals,
<b>Angus Foster</b> discussed <b><i>The Use of X-ray Diffraction
in the Pharmaceutical Development of a Dihydrate API</i></b><i>,
a</i> compound with complex hydration behaviour, which readily
loses water under typical manufacturing conditions. Many
techniques, including single crystal and VT powder XRD, VT-FTIR
and isothermal-TGA to investigate under which conditions the
compound could be dried and still remain crystalline.</p>
<p><b>Peter Laggner</b> finished the session by discussing
<b><i>Monitoring non-ambient nanophase processes by
TR-SWAXS</i></b><i>.</i> He gave a description of the equipment
used, and then went on to discuss lipid polymorphism. By using
temperature jump and pressure studies on membranes he could show
that cholesterol induces softening when present in low
concentration, but at high concentrations caused hardening of the
membrane.</p>
