<h3>An Introduction to Powder Diffraction and Phase
Identification Workshop</h3>
<p>15-16 April, 2003</p>
<p>Organisers: Judith Shackleton and Dave Taylor with principal
speaker, John Faber.</p>
<p>This session started on Tuesday afternoon with a most useful
refresher on the basic theory of powder diffraction - much of
which I remembered I'd forgotten!</p>
<p>With "An Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry" by Ron
Jenkins &amp; Robert L. Snyder (John Wiley &amp; Sons) being used
as the major reference source.</p>
<p>It began at the very beginning with Laue photographs of single
crystals and powders and from here went on to describe the unit
cell, fractional co-ordinates, crystal systems, the 14 Bravais
Lattices and Space Groups.</p>
<p>We then "learnt" about calculated density vs. measured
density, lattice planes, Braggs Law, reciprocal space and
calculated d spacings.</p>
<p>This led on to peak intensities (measured and calculated) and
calculated diffraction patterns.</p>
<p>We then discussed the temperature factor, thermal diffuse
scattering and counting statistics.</p>
<p>Briefly we discussed X-ray production, data recording and the
fact that it is still sometimes better to record XRD data on film
rather than with a counter.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, we all got up jolly early and were in our seats
for the 8.30 am kick-off!</p>
<p>Dave Taylor described the development of the ICDD Database
from the early days of the PDF (paper based, which I still find
very useful) through to the PDF2 (CD-ROM).</p>
<p>Measured 2theta values from film; recorder paper or APD's are
worthless unless the instrument is calibrated. From this we
discussed the Reference Intensity Ratio, and Measurement
Errors.</p>
<p>SRM1976 - the standard Corundum sample, Silver Behenate (for
low angle work) and a mixed Lanthanum Hexaboride/Silver Behenate
standards were all discussed, which led on to preferred
orientation and the fact that sometimes (most of the time?) it is
only possible to record oriented diffraction data.</p>
<p>John Faber then described the evolution of search
indexing/search match routines especially those of Hanawalt (Don)
and Fink (Hugo). He then went on to talk about GOM (Goodness Of
Match), and the PDF 4 search /match program and other relational
databases.</p>
<p>After tea in the afternoon we all got the opportunity to try
out the next release of PCIWIN software. This is a (very) new PC
based Hanawalt/Fink - Search/Match program.</p>
<p>It is a fairly complicated software package (obviously) and
worked reasonably well with the examples provided. However, as
with all new software, it still had a few bugs that need to be
sorted before it is released as a commercial product (which may
well have been addressed by the time that you read this
report).</p>

<h3>Forum II meeting reports</h3>
<p>13-14 <sup>th</sup> November 2003, Birkbeck College, London</p>
<h4>Thursday 13th AM</h4>
<p>The meeting started with a brief introduction by Jeremy
Cockcroft who also thanked Dave Taylor for all his hard work in
organising the meeting. Unfortunately, Dave could not be at the
present as his wife Ann was recovering from hospital treatment.
We all wish you a speedy recovery Ann.</p>
<p>Opening session - Non-ambient Diffraction + Amorphous
Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p><b>1. In-situ Diffraction From Materials and Macromolecules
Under Microwave Irradiation - Andrew Harrison, University of
Edinburgh.</b></p>
<p>The design and construction of equipment to drive solid-state
reactions using microwave radiation and the monitoring thereof
using X-ray or neutron scattering was discussed.</p>
<p>Andrew described how fundamental information could be obtained
from in-situ studies for e.g. the direct synthesis of magnetite
from microwave hydrolysis of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>.</p>
<p>The original microwave source was a commercially available
microwave oven, which was attacked with a hacksaw and a soldering
iron! However, it was soon discovered that these units are
unsuitable for sensitive heating control because they always run
at full power - only the time of the irradiation can be
varied.</p>
<p>This experimentation led to the development of a purpose built
instrument in which the microwaves could be "broadcast" by use of
an antennae inside a high-pressure reaction bomb.</p>
<p>Issues with thermometry, uneven heating and hotspots were also
discussed as were the measurement of cell parameters including
lattice expansion.</p>
<p>Future work will include in-vivo studies of biomolecules for
e.g. protein "wringing" modes.</p>
<p><b>2. Non-Ambient Laboratory Powder Diffraction Studies -
Synthesis, Kinetics And Phase Transitions - John Evans University
of Durham.</b></p>
<p>In this presentation John described some of the laboratory
experiments, which have been made possible by new developments in
non-ambient powder diffraction technology including the synthesis
of materials, the study of reaction kinetics and phase
transitions.</p>
<p>The equipment used was a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
combined with a 1500 K furnace, a Cryofurnace (77 - 723 K) and a
Cryostat (11 - 300K).</p>
<p>Variable temperature powder diffraction gives lots of new
information about the properties of materials for e.g. expansion
rates, phase transitions, kinetics, crystallization, chemistry,
order-disorder transitions.</p>
<p>Structural phase transitions of inorganic oxides, for e.g.
framework materials such as ZrW<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, in which the unit cell is
found to have a negative coefficient of thermal expansion.</p>
<p>Following the change of width of the diffraction peaks enables
the monitoring of domain changes as a function of time.<br>
(This work is available via the RSC website - a "Hot"
article).</p>
<p>Synthesis of ZrW<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> has also been performed in the
diffractometer.</p>
<p><b>3. A Review of Methods Used to Quantify Amorphous Content
in "Crystals" - Graham Buckton, The School of Pharmacy,
University of London.</b></p>
<p>Graham started his presentation by asking the question - "Is
amorphous material important" to which the answer is -<br>
"Yes - very".</p>
<p>Amorphous material is usually thermodynamically unstable, its
presence is not normally intentional (e.g. it is introduced
during the milling process) and it acts as sites for the
absorption of water. Normally present at about the 1-2%
level.</p>
<p>How does one study / quantify it? Various techniques
available;</p>
<ul>
<li>DSC</li>
<li>XRPD</li>
<li>Spectroscopy's</li>
<li>Inverse Phase Gas Chromatography</li>
</ul>
<p>For example amorphous lactose and amorphous raffinose<br>
Both may contain 1-2% amorphous material, which effect inhalation
efficiency and the solubility of drugs for oral delivery.</p>
<p>Amorphous content may be viewed in two different ways;<br>
There may be crystals with a 99% crystalline core and a 1%
amorphous surface or 99% of the particles may be crystalline and
the remaining 1% is amorphous.</p>
<p>If the product starts at 100% crystalline physical
manipulations such as milling will disrupt the surface and
introduce an amorphous phase(s?), which will vary with time so
the properties of your product are not constant and will vary
from batch to batch.</p>

<h4>Thursday 13th PM &ndash; Crystallography in Materials Science </h4>

<p><b>4. Standardless Phase Quantification of Industrial Coatings
- Susan Etok, RMCS Cranfield University.</b></p>
<p>Susan described the process of plasma spraying of
hydroxyapatite onto titanium substrates compared to direct, low
temperature electrodeposition for use in prosthetic coatings. It
is important to measure the amount of amorphous calcium phosphate
in these coatings and this was done using XRD.</p>
<p><b>5. Understanding Gear Performance with X-ray Diffraction -
Brian Shaw, Design Unit, University of Newcastle.</b></p>
<p>Submarine Gearboxes - makes a change (sorry!)<br>
Statement - "gears fail mainly from fatigue"</p>
<p>Brian described the importance of how gear design and
mechanical alignment can be improved from residual stress XRD
measurements.</p>
<p><b>6. Use of Intense Radiation Sources in the Study of
Functional Materials - Paul Barnes, Industrial Materials Group,
Department of Crystallography, Birkbeck College.</b></p>
<p>Paul described how neutron and synchrotron sources are
enhancing rapid time resolved observation of functional materials
using such techniques as XRD.</p>
<p>Three stories were told to enlighten us;<br>
The Brownmillerite story<br>
The Zirconium Hydroxide Story and<br>
The TEDDI
story&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p><b>7. Building Your Own Furnace for HT-XRD - Gopinathan
Sankar, Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, The Royal Institution
of GB.</b></p>
<p>This paper described some of the in situ cells that have been
developed for examining phase transformations in catalytic
materials.</p>
<p><b>8. Using High Temperature X-ray Diffraction with Steel /
Aluminium Production: Look Where the Action is! - Stefan Melzer,
Corus RD&amp;T, Ceramics Research Centre, The
Netherlands.</b></p>
<p>This presentation described how production processes can be
controlled and improved by following the melting and
crystallisation of materials at high temperatures using X-ray
diffraction.</p>
<p><b>9. Inconstant Catalysts - Steve Norval, ICI Measurements
Science Group</b></p>
<p>Amongst other processes, Steve described the importance of XRD
in catalyst design noting amongst others the production of
ethylene oxide (a major precursor of many surfactants) and the
production of margarine from linoleic acid.</p>
<h4>Friday 14th November AM</h4>
<a name="CSawrd"></a> 
<p><b>Industrial Group Award Lecture: Adventures in
Crystallography in the Gas Turbine Industry - Colin Small, Rolls
Royce PLC, Derby.</b></p>
<p>Following an introduction from Judith Shackleton in which
Colin's' career in XRD at RR was described pictographically using
"Haircuts Through the Ages" as it's central theme, Judith
presented Colin with his BCA IG award for outstanding
contribution to X-ray Analysis which was a molecular model of
Diopside (CaMgSiO<sub>3</sub>). She also presented him with a model of a
Supermarine Spitfire and a pair of the most sought after Vulcan
Appreciation Society socks!</p>
<p>After much applause, Colin thanked Judith and the audience and
with his normal aplomb got stuck into his presentation. Oh dear,
oh dear me. Colin was not up to his normal stratospheric
presentational standards - no, this time he surpassed himself!
His description and video footage of the Rolls Royce patented
goose slicer (more of which later) will long be remembered by the
traumatised audience (which included Colin's parents, wife and
children).</p>
<center><img alt="csmall (13K)" src="images/csmall.jpg" height="200" width="260" /></center>
<p>Colin went on to describe the Rolls Royce Trent 900 gas
turbine engine, which will eventually be fitted onto the Airbus
A380 airliner, which will ferry us all about the planet during
our summer hols. (Bye-the-way this engine has a by-pass ratio of
8.1:1 and develops 70,000 lbs of thrust).</p>
<p>As aeroplanes fly through the air they ingest any manner of
debris; from hailstones through to the major constituent of your
Christmas dinner. So, not surprisingly, the testing procedures
that these engines have to endure are extremely rigorous. Some of
these Colin described, including the hail gun, during which a
zillion tons of ice per minute are "shot" at a running engine and
the bird injection test, for which there are three standards -
the small bird (~2 &frac12; lb chicken) the medium bird and the
large bird, (the afore mentioned goose) of about 8 lbs. Colin
pointed out the importance of defrosting the feathery projectiles
before shooting them into the engines !</p>
<p>Colin went on to describe the importance of determining the
structural integrity of the turbine blades of the engine and how
this is monitored using XRD.</p>
<p>The turbine blade is also full of small holes to allow the
passage of 70 tons/min of air through the engine and in dusty
environments (e.g. deserts) these holes can clog up with dust
which melts (to form Diopside which was identified using XRD) and
as the blades are operating at some temperature above their
melting point this is not a good thing!</p>
<p>Next was the problem of volcanoes - or more specifically the
problems encountered when an aircraft flies through the dust
plume of an eruption. The dust particles from an eruption are
extremely abrasive and it has been one of Colin's major tasks
over the last few years to understand exactly what goes on inside
a gas turbine engine when it swallows umpteen tons of vapourized
pumice.</p>
<p>The fan blades of the engine - the ones at the front (and do
the bird slicing) - are composed of three sheets of titanium and
are hollow. The way in which the crystalline texture of these
blades is effected during their manufacture is crucial. Colin
went on to describe his use of pole figures, Euler space and
orientation distribution functions in his quest for a numerical
description of texture of the fan blades that engineers could
understand.</p>
<p>Colin concluded his lecture by describing how the turbine
rotor shaft is joined using an enormous inertia welding kit. The
only way to examine the resulting joint is by neutron diffraction
and this was carried out at the ISIS facility at RAL (must have
been difficult getting the samples in and out of the hire
car!).</p>
<p>Another round of applause followed - Colin, X-ray diffraction
lectures will never be the same again!</p>
<h4>Friday 14th AM Industrial Applications of XRD</h4>
<p><b>1. Microstructural Characteristics of Advanced Materials
Using Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) - Phil Holdway
(and H.S. Ubhi) QinetiQ Ltd, Farnborough, Hampshire.</b></p>
<p>Phil briefly described the theory of EBSD before moving on to
some applications. First of all you need an SEM with the sample
tilted to around 70&ordm; and successful analysis relies on
having strain free surfaces and Kikuchi patterns are produced
from Bragg diffraction peaks of back scattered electrons from the
sample which have an interaction depth on the sample of ~50 nm.
Data collection is made by scanning over a grid and can be either
manual or automatic. For example shape memory alloys - Ti/Ni -
the SEM image is used to select a particle for analysis then EDS
is used for elemental analysis and EBSD to determine the
crystalline properties of the particle - in this way it is
possible to obtain complete identification of small particles
within an alloy with no need for TEM or XRD. Phil then went on to
discuss the analysis of ZrH and ZrH2 formation on the surface of
Zircalloy. And the analysis of grain structure in laser deposited
W, a process that enables the formation of complicated shapes
that could not be manufactured using conventional machining
techniques. (It is much less wasteful to build a structure up
rather than start of with a large lump and end up with a pile of
swarf).</p>
<p>Phil went on to say that although EBSD ids a powerful tool and
can make up to 50 measurements a second, only a very small area
is examined when compared with conventional XRD.</p>
<p><b>2. XRD and Reflectivity Measurements in the Glass Industry
- Mark Farnworth, Pilkington plc.</b></p>
<p>Mark described how the techniques of XRPD, GAXRD, pole figures
and X-ray Reflectivity measurements can be used to examine
samples from all stages of glass manufacture, from the
crystalline raw materials to the amorphous final product. GAXRD
is used to examine thin coatings on the glass surfacrce for e.g.
hydrophobic coatings, which disperse water. Refractory materials
are examined to determine how much non-crystalline material is
present and the amounts of quartz, cristobalite and tridimite.
Also, multi-layer stack coatings are examined e.g. Ti ZrO2 Ag Si.
Texture maps can be produced which show the degree of texture in
the silver layer of the coatings and the thickness, density, top
and bottom roughness of each individual layer can be
measured.</p>
<p><b>3. Applications of XRD in the Imaging Industry - David
Beveridge, Ilford Ltd.</b></p>
<p>With the advent of digital imaging technology the decline in
sales of silver halide based film emulsions has been swift. So
members of the imaging industry have had to adapt just as swiftly
and this has had an effect of the type of samples that the X-ray
crystallographer can now be expected to examine. David 
explained that, historically, most of his samples were silver
halide film surfaces and included the identification of the
composition of processing solutions, now the majority of his
samples are from printer-pigmented inks.</p>

<h3>Pharmaceutical Parallel Sessions &ndash; Thursday PM &amp; Friday AM </h3>

<p>Over the course of two days three parallel sessions were held
covering non-ambient PXRD applications, polymorphism case studies
and the analysis of amorphous materials in a series of nine
30-minute lectures.</p>
<p>The non-ambient session was started with an excellent
introduction to RELATIVE HUMIDITY CONTROLLED X-RAY DIFFRACTION by
Brett Cooper, (MSD), explaining what relative humidity is and how
its variation can impact on pharmaceutical ingredients. He
described the latest computer controlled system and how it is now
possible to mimic the complementary technique of Dynamic Vapour
Sorption (DVS). An example of one of these new computer
controlled systems, the Bruker/Ansycos Hot Humidity Controlled
system giving the ability to stress samples with combinations of
high temperature and high relative humidity.</p>
<p>Terry Threlfall (University of Southampton) spoke on
STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY, DISSIMILARITY AND REPRESENTATION using
alklimetal tartars, frusemide and sulponamides as examples to
reveal unexpected relationships between structures.</p>
<p>The use of high pressure was described by Simon Parsons
(University of Edinburgh), POLYMORPHISM INDUCED BY HIGH PRESSURE,
pushing out the boundaries of polymorph hunting. He described the
experimental conditions using a diamond anvil cell, CCD
diffractometer and 'fairly modest' pressures (1-15kbar) to search
for new forms of formamide, pryridine and glycine. The
high-pressure system was also used to study the formation of
co-crystals.</p>
<p>Chris Frampton, (Bruker-Nonius) POLYMORPHIC DRUGS SCIENCE,
FASHION OR VALUABLE PRODUCTS gave a highly interesting and
entertaining talk on the importance of establishing the most
stable form of a compound and acquiring the intellectual property
rights. He used the examples of Ranitidine, Ritonavir and
Paroxetine to illustrate his talk.</p>
<p>The importance of finding the most stable form was emphasised
by Dan Cowell, (Pharmorphix Ltd.), POLYMORPHISM STUDIES IN THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. Dan stressed that high throughput
screening was only part of the answer and that better focused
screening at medium and low throughput could lead to the most
stable form with greater understanding.</p>
<p>THERMAL TRANSFORMATIONS-CASE STUDIES by Ron Roberts
(AstraZeneca) showed examples of structural changes during
heating and cooling using hot-stage X-ray diffraction. Examples
of lattice expansion and calculation of thermal expansion
coefficients were also shown.</p>
<p>Stephan Watts, STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISATICS OF THE AMPRPHOUS
PHASE: A COMPUTER MODELLING APPROACH, (Pfizer Institute for
Materials Sciences, University of Cambridge) talked about a new
approach to the understanding of amorphous materials using
molecular dynamic simulation techniques.</p>
<p>The final two lectures concentrated on novel techniques for
the quantification of the amount of the amorphous phase in
materials. Paul Royall, (Kings College, London), APPLICATION OF
DYNAMIC MECHANICAL ANALYSIS (DMA) IN THE CHARACTERISATION OF
AMORPHOUS POWDER spoke of the application of DMA to powders as
opposed to solid samples. Mixtures of amorphous and crystalline
lactose were used to establish a linear relationship between the
amorphous content and the DMA relaxation strength. The results
from a sample of micronised crystalline lactose were more complex
and further work is ongoing to understand these results.</p>
<p>Susan Barker, (University of East Anglia), THE USE OF
THERMALLY STIMULATED CURRENT SPECTROSCOPY (TSC) IN THE STUDY OF
AMORPHOUS AND POLYMORPHIC MATERIALS, described TSC as an
electrical technique whereby dipolar movement and relaxation is
measured under the influence of varying thermal and electrical
stresses. The various modes of operation of TSC were described in
relationship to caffeine and indomethacin.</p>
<p>In all, a very interesting session for all those interested in
the characterisation of pharmaceutical solids.</p>
<h4>Friday 14th pm Joint Session</h4>
<p>The final session of the forum was devoted to the theme of
X-ray Diffraction: Past, Present, and Future. With the meeting
being held in the Clore management centre in Torrington Square,
Birkbeck College, then it was highly appropriate that Alan Mackay
should open the session with a lecture on the past. &ndash; the old
buildings of the Crystallography Department as founded by
J.D.Bernal used to stand on the adjacent site. Amongst the many
photos of old equipment, he showed a picture of Bernal's X-ray
rotation camera &ndash; and then contrasted it with the "big science"
now done at the ESRF. Probably though the biggest changes have
been in computing as shown by the photo of an early computer at
Birkbeck college from the 1950s laboratory of Donald Booth. </p>
<p>The second talk was by Judith Shackleton on present X-ray
instrumentation, a difficult talk to give without advertising the
advantages of one manufacture over an another. After working her
way through the maze of primary and secondary optics,
monochromators and mirrors, area and solid-state detectors, she
arrived at the "Portable Stress Diffractometer" &ndash; a most
remarkable piece of kit capable of measuring stresses in very
large objects indeed. One wondered what the response would be at
Birkbeck College to its lack of radiation shielding! </p>
<p>The Industrial Group committee decided that the final talk of the
forum should be an <b>Alun Bowen lecture</b> given the importance of
future instrumentation for industrial crystallography. The talk
on the new UK synchrotron source was given appropriately by
Alexander Korsunsky, who described the features of the beamline
JEEP proposed for DIAMOND. The talk ended with an aerial photo of
the DIAMOND site showing that construction was now seriously
underway and the "future" lay just ahead.</p>
