<h1><a name="Chair98">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1998</a></h1>

<h2>to the 1999 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>

Dr Steve Norval reported :<br>
 <br>
<p>This is the end of my first year as Group Chairman and it has
certainly been different. The fact that our AGM is being held in
a Coventry hotel is evidence in itself. 1998 largely followed our
standard pattern, but that does not simply mean more of the same.
I fe
el that one of the great successes of the IG over the last
few years has been the innovation in our activities.</p>

<p>Our meetings in the last year included a second Special
Interest Group meeting on Elevated Temperature XRD held at ICI
Wilton in June and led by Dave Taylor. It was good to see
discussion developing during the day and we would like these
groups to develop as opportunities to learn from one another's
experience. A first workshop on Residual Stress took place in
September, held at t
he Open University and organized by Kath Clay
and Colin Small. It was a very lively meeting, attended by
twenty-seven people, which began to identify a community of
crystallographers interested in characterizing structural
materials. We hope to see another Special Interest Group develop,
probably covering several aspects of diffraction from these
materials. The Autumn meeting returned to Runcorn, this time
hosted by Zeneca and organized by Graham McPherson and Philip
Lake. We were provided with a wi
de-ranging programme and
excellent presentations that deservedly attracted many
compliments. Our thanks go to ICI, the Open University and Zeneca
for their hospitality.</p>

<p>The group Newsletter has been strongly developed over the last
few years by Bruce Fox, becoming an increasingly a 'good read'
rather than a list of events past and future. Thanks to Dave
Taylor's efforts it is now available on the Group web pages along
with current and historical information, acting as a superb
advertisemen
t for our activities. Dave circulated the revamped
web pages on floppy disk earlier in the year and we expect
electronic publication to become increasingly important over the
next few years. It should provide a means of inexpensively and
efficiently increasing our Newsletter circulation.</p>

<p>The IUCr Congress is to be held at Glasgow in August this
year. Because of the Congress there is no BCA Spring Meeting, so
the committee decided to concentrate efforts on the two-day
Industrial Crystallogra
phy Forum at the Royal Court Hotel,
Coventry, during which this AGM is being held. Most of the
group's activities for a normal year have been fitted in.
Eighty-five people have registered and been rewarded by high
standards of science and presentation. The concept has been to
mix specialist and more general sessions including formal
presentations and workshop discussions in comfortable
surroundings. The committee will certainly want to consider how
best to build on the successes and we are anxious t
o hear your
opinions. Thanks go to all the many people who have helped put
this meeting together. Jo Jutson, who put enormous effort into
the Hotel arrangements and finances, deserves very special
thanks, as does Dave Taylor who looked after the other aspects of
administration.</p>

<p>Our commercial sponsors are very important to us. We are
indebted to Bruker-AXS, ICDD, Microsource - Bede, Oxford
Cryosystems and Philips Analytical for their contributions to the
Forum. We also remember with thanks
 the generous contributions
that have been made during the year to sponsor the other meetings
and publication of the Newsletter.</p>

<p>We have a committee of very busy people who generously give
their time and have contributed enormously to the Group's ongoing
success. It is a great privilege to work with them. This year,
three of the committee are retiring. Keith Rogers completes his
three years as a highly valued academic member. Jamshed Anwar has
been with us for six years as an academic membe
r and subsequently
in the role of ICDD representative. Bruce Fox has been a
committee member for three years and Vice Chairman for the last
year. We will greatly miss them all and thank them for their
labours.</p>

<p>Finally, thank you all for continuing to support the group's
activities. Many of those attending represent whole industries
that would barely have had a look in at our meetings a few years
ago. It is encouraging that there is another generation of
crystallographers to pick up a few w
rinkles on the old tricks and
teach us some new ones. It is not yet clear if the Group will
hold another meeting during 1999, but we look forward to seeing
you an Herriott Watt University for the Spring Meeting 2000.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair97">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1997</a></h1>

<h2>to the 1998 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>


Mr David Taylor reported :<br>
 <br>
 

<p>I have enjoyed my term as chairman. I have now retired from
Pilkington and my decision to retire a year early as your
chairman will allow me to pursue other activities, and my
successor time to get his feet under the table before the IUCR
meeting in Glasgow next year. However, I am planning to stay
active in the x-ray analysis field, so you haven't seen the last
of me yet. The Group membership scheme, whereby attending an
Industrial Group meeting (ex
cluding spring meeting) qualifies for
BCA membership or renewal, continues to provide new members and
many Industrialists are now using the scheme to renew their
membership. The three qualifying meetings in the past year
resulted in 21 new BCA members and 62 membership renewals and
there are already over 20 renewals pending for 1999.</p>

<p>Our meeting programme for the last year followed on from the
well received programme of events at the Leeds Spring meeting
where we welcomed Kath Clay, Mary Vi
ckers and Philip Lake to the
committee. In June I arranged a meeting at Pilkington on
diffraction at Elevated temperature. Considering the specialist
nature of the topic it was well attended (34) and following a
favourable response will become our second Special Interest Group
(SIG) with the next meeting on 4 June 1998 at ICI Wilton. I thank
Pilkington for providing lunch and Philips who supplied the wine
to accompany the buffet. The Autumn meeting at Cranfield on
Industrial Crystallography was well
 attended (41). I thank the
Royal Military College for their hospitality and Keith Rogers for
the local arrangements and putting together a programme of
interest to all. We even tried out a new idea of finding
solutions to problems submitted by the audience in open debate.
It went well and created some interesting discussion and answers
for the varied problems put forward. In fact the BCA President
was so taken with the idea it is being tried out on a wider
audience at the Spring meeting. The third 
meeting of the
Pharmaceutical SIG took place on 18 March 1998 at Roche
Discovery, Welwyn. I was able to attend a well-organised meeting
with an excellent technical programme. Thanks go to Philip Lake
and Jamshed Anwar for the technical programme and Chris Frampton
and Roche for provision of lunch and the local arrangements. It
was well received and a high attendance (68) was maintained
showing that the momentum of SIG's is sustainable.</p>

<p>Steve Norval has represented the BCA at two meetings of
 a
group involved in a European Initiative on Powder Diffraction
Standardisation. He is keeping members informed of progress in
this important area through Crystallography News, our own
Newsletter and presentations at technical meetings. A set of
draft documents is currently under review in the UK by a team of
interested parties. It is important that members understand the
importance of developments in this area, as it will affect our
operating procedures.</p>

<p>Two editions of the Industrial Gr
oup Newsletter have been
produced and the quality is improving issue by issue thanks to
the efforts of our editor Bruce Fox. We are obliged to send a
copy to all BCA members who tick our group as a main or special
interest on the membership form (currently 185 members). Our
efforts continue to get a copy onto the desk of every active
industrial diffraction user in the country and are continually
reviewing a circulation list of over 450. Thanks to all who
contributed to the content, keeping members i
nformed of our
activities is essential to the future of the group. The printing
and dispatch of the August 97 and January 98 Newsletters has been
handled and funded by Pilkington and Raychem respectively to whom
we are indebted.<br>
</p>

<p>There were no nominations for an Industrial Group Award this
year. We have introduced an Industrial Group logo with Ron
Pflaumer submitting the winning entry in a design competition. I
hope you like the new design and that it will help to quickly
identify Ind
ustrial Group material. An Instrument Sensitivity
Round Robin exercise in conjunction with ICDD has been completed
with over 30 UK participants. A report has been issued and a
valuable resource on instrument sensitivity has been generated.
It is now available on the BCA web pages as a set of self-test
files. I have been invited to present the results at the Denver
Conference in a workshop covering the tests world-wide.</p>

<p>This year sees a number of changes to our committee; Tim Hyde
has served
 his three years, a vacancy was held over from last
year and of course my retirement. Tim has been involved in many
of our activities and we have lots of meeting reports to thank
him for. Perhaps his hardest task has resulted in the excellent
Hardware and Software Session we have just enjoyed. The other
activities here at St Andrews were a workshop on Data Quality -
Fit for the purpose organised by Mary Vickers and the second Alun
Bowen Industrial Lecture given by Bob Snyder. The BCA are not
holding
 a Spring Meeting next year because of the IUCR meeting in
Glasgow. However, the Industrial Group has decided to have a
meeting spanning two days in the spring of next year
incorporating the Industrial Group AGM, the Alun Bowen Lecture, a
general interest session and individual SIG meetings.</p>

<p>The support given to the Group by commercial suppliers is
acknowledged, especially to Bruker AXS for their support towards
the cost of the Autumn and Pharmaceutical meetings, Philips for
support towards
 the cost of the Elevated Temperature workshop and
the Pharmaceutical meeting. I thank our hosts for their
hospitality in support of meetings at Pilkington - Lathom,
Cranfield University - Swindon and Roche Discovery - Welwyn.
Also, all the speakers who have put so much effort into making
the years technical programme so interesting and rewarding.</p>

<p>I thank all the committee members who have helped make my
spell as your Chairman an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
Their efforts behind the 
scenes underpin all our activities and
are reflected in the quality of the technical programmes that we
have been able to present. It is a team effort and the astute
will have noticed that all bar one of your committee have already
been mentioned in this report for the part that they have played
in our activities this year. I said last year that following Eric
Kelly as our Secretary Treasurer would be a difficult task, but
Jo Jutson has taken on the responsibility, efficiently fulfilling
the demandi
ng role and still finding time to present a talk
alongside Kath Clay at the Autumn meeting.</p>

<p>Finally I thank all the members who have supported our
activities during my two years chairmanship. It extends to 161
individual members and a special thanks to the two who attended
all six meetings! I leave the group in the capable hands of a
well balanced, hard working committee and I'm sure that with your
support the Industrial Group will continue to flourish.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair96">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1996</a></h1>

<h2>to the 1997 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>

Mr David Taylor reported :

<p align="left">I have enjoyed my first year as chairman largely
as a result of the efforts of our past chairman David Dyson whose
planning and foresight had left the Group well prepared for the
future. I thank Davi
d for his contribution to the Industrial
Group over his period of office. We were all saddened by the
deaths of Industrial Group Award recipients Alun Bowen and Peter
Salt. Both contributed to our knowledge of diffraction and will
be missed by the diffraction community.</p>

<p>The Group membership scheme, whereby attending an Industrial
Group meeting (excluding spring meeting) qualifies for BCA
membership or renewal, continues to provide new members and many
Industrialists are now using the scheme
 to renew their
membership. It has now been established that the effort involved
in running the scheme is worthwhile and that it should
continue.</p>

<p>Our meeting programme for the last year followed on from the
well received programme of events at the Cambridge Spring
meeting. In September Bruce Fox arranged and organised a meeting
at Raychem on Reflectivity. It was the first time the group has
covered this new and very specialised topic, consequently the low
attendance of 20 was expected. How
ever, much was learned by the
few industrial practitioners present and we intend to look to a
wider European audience for future meetings on this topic.</p>

<p>The Autumn meeting on Industrial Crystallography was well
attended and I thank Jo Jutson for arranging a programme of
interest to all, which included an optional visit to the ISIS
facility. Our hosts for the meeting were AEA Technology and
thanks go to Frank Cullen for the local arrangements at
Harwell.</p>

<p>Two Industrial Group awards
 were made at the Autumn meeting.
The first to Brian Bellamy in recognition of his contribution to
diffraction over his many years service at Harwell. The second
was to Alun Bowen in recognition of his work on residual stress.
Sadly, although Alun knew of the award, he died before it could
be presented. It was accepted on his behalf by his widow Chris
Bowen who was accompanied by her daughter Clare. The award was
presented by Brian Bellamy who gave a fitting tribute to Aluns
contribution to Industri
al Crystallography and the BCA over many
years.</p>

<p>We have introduced a new approach to the organisation of
meetings on specialist interest topics by developing Special
Interest Groups (SIG). The first SIG has been established to
cover the interests of the Pharmaceutical industry with Philip
Lake and Jamshed Anwar given the responsibility of organising an
annual meeting of the group. The first meeting under the
Industrial Group SIG banner took place on 17 March 1997 at Glaxo
Wellcome Stevanag
e. It was well received and attendance (68) was
high. Steve Norval has been given the remit to examine the
potential to develop other Special Interest Groups. It is hoped
to develop these on the back of future themed one day meetings
and the viability of a Non Ambient Group will be gauged at the
meeting planned for 4 June 1997. Steve has been nominated to
represent the Group on a European Initiative on Powder
Diffraction Standardisation and will keep members informed of
progress in this important ar
ea.</p>

<p>The Leeds spring meeting has two Industrial Group sessions and
a workshop. Our plenary has been renamed the - Alun Bowen
Industrial Lecture- as a lasting tribute to Aluns contribution to
Industrial Crystallography and the first lecture by Prof. Paul
Barnes has set a high standard for others to follow.</p>

<p>A session titled Diffraction Plus... Simultaneous Methods has
been organised by Craig Adam. It explores the possibilities of
using additional analytical techniques alongside diffr
action
measurements. A session on Process &amp; Production Applications
of Diffraction, organised by Steve Norval, looks at the role of
diffraction in the support of manufacturing processes. A special
effort to encourage posters was rewarded by nine posters being
submitted to the Industrial section, a big increase over the last
few years. The workshop sees the culmination of the Round Robin
exercise with Ron Jenkins resolving all our Instrument
sensitivity problems. The Round Robin exercise has prov
ed a
useful test of instrument performance for 33 instruments in the
UK and has set a benchmark against which any instrument can be
gauged. Keeping our members informed has been achieved by two
editions of the Industrial Group Newsletter edited by Bruce Fox
and our efforts continue to get a copy onto the desk of every
industrial diffraction user in the country with a circulation of
over 400.</p>

<p>This year sees a large number of changes to our committee with
Colin Small, Derek Hart, Craig Adam,
 Bruce Fox and Eric Kelly all
retiring after serving their term of office. They have all given
freely of their time in support of our activities and have all
been responsible for arranging at least one of our meetings and
speaking at others, I thank them all. Perhaps Eric should be
singled out for special praise. The office of Secretary Treasurer
is a demanding one which he has carried it on into his retirement
from EA Technology. Oiling the wheels of our organisation has
been a very worthwhile reti
rement hobby. However, I am sure that
their replacements will provide new impetus to the Groups
activities. Action has been taken in an attempt to give a more
even spread of committee retirements. A committee vacancy will be
held for one year and a nominated committee member has agreed to
serve a two year term. The vacancy will be filled by the
co-option of Bruce Fox who will continue to edit our Newsletter
and co-ordinate our WWW pages.</p>

<p>The support given to the Group by commercial supplier
s is
acknowledged, especially to MSI for their sponsorship of
&pound;400 towards the cost of Pharmaceutical meeting. I thank
our hosts for their hospitality in support of meetings at Raychem
- Swindon, AEA Technology - Harwell and Glaxo Wellcome -
Stevenage. Also, all the speakers who have put so much effort
into making the years activities so interesting and
rewarding.</p>

<p>I look forward to next years programme and I'm sure that with
your support the Industrial Group will continue to flourish

<h1><a name="Chair95">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1995</a></h1>

<h2>to the 1996 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>

Dr David Dyson reported :
 <p>
 This year has seen a consolidation of the changes we started to
introduce the previous year. We have combined introductory
aspects of crystallography with its applications in industrial
and academic research environments. It is 
pleasing to be able to
report that, whilst the support may not be that seen a decade
ago, our numbers have remained constant, particularly at our one
day meetings. The success of our programme of events has been
largely due to the teamwork of the committee members, helped by
the personnel at the host meeting sites together with the
equipment manufacturers. All this help is acknowledged
gratefully. 

<p>Our year started with two excellently organised sessions (by
Steve Norval, Craig Adam and Jo Jut
son) at Cardiff which covered
Novel Materials and Rietveld Analysis in Industry. This was
supported by a course run by Ron Jenkins (ICDD) who introduced
our newer members to the problems of data collection and
search/match methods for phase identification. Ron also delivered
a very interesting Plenary Lecture on the work of ICDD with
particular reference to the new search/match techniques. The
first part of a seminar on Quantitative Methods of Analysis was
held at Sir William Siemens House, Manchest
er in June. The papers
presented were published in a booklet, a first for the Group, and
so provide a record of the proceedings and a useful source of
advice and reference material for the newcomer and experienced
user alike. Our thanks go to Siemens' staff for arranging the
publication. The Autumn Meeting was held at British Steel,
Rotherham and sponsored by Rigaku. The meeting was organised by
Steve Norval and covered the analysis of small amounts of sample:
the review of different approaches to t
he problems proved
rewarding. The second part of the Quantitative Methods seminar
was held in February at the Philips Research Laboratories at
Redhill, Surrey. The seven papers drew on the information
presented in part one and consolidated the information. Again we
thank the hosts for their help and their offer to arrange
publishing of the papers presented.</p>

<p>Our final meeting has been the current Spring Meeting where
our sessions have covered Structure and Data (organised by Dave
Taylor) an
d Preferred Orientation (Colin Small). The first of
these sessions complemented the short course on Essential
Crystallography for Industrial Powder Diffraction Users that we
have run during the Spring Meeting . Much work has gone into this
course and our thanks go to Jeremy Cockroft of Birkbeck College
for preparing and teaching the course and to Dave Taylor for his
part in organising the course.</p>

<p>We are always thinking about further topics for our meetings
and hope to arrange sessions on ph
armaceuticals and on residual
stress measurements in the near future.</p>

<p>We have made an Industrial Group Award to Peter Salt in
recognition of his contribution to crystallography, particularly
in the field of clay minerals analysis. His work is recognised
internationally and the award has been a popular one. Peter has
retired now and we wish him well.</p>

<p>We have introduced a new scheme to attract more industrial
users of XRD into membership of the BCA. The changes are aimed at
attracti
ng new users and maintaining their interest in the IG
activities. This has been a success so far and sixty-one members
have joined or renewed their BCA membership through attendance at
our meetings.</p>

<p>It is of interest that authors are becoming more conscious of
the accuracy, precision and errors of their results. Many are
concerned with these aspects and it has been said that
measurements with an associated expression of uncertainty are
incomplete. Inevitably, this has cropped up at our meet
ings and
it is good to see that it is being taken seriously - even thought
we do not seem to have an internationally recognised standard.
One way to check quality of results is by round robin samples.
Such an exercise, using the NIST SRM1976 alumina plate standard,
was launched at our 1995 Autumn Meeting. Several UK participants
have already generated results for this survey.</p>

<p>Co-ordination of many of these activities has involved a
considerable amount of time and our thanks go to Eric Kelly
 for
the effort he has freely given.</p>

<p>Keeping our members informed has been of prime importance to
us as the changes have been introduced. Our Newsletter proved an
effective way of doing this. There have been two issues this
year: the quality and contents are a tribute to those concerned
with editing it. One of these - Trevor Carter - retires from the
Committee this year and I would like to thank him for his efforts
while on the Committee, at the same time wishing his successor,
Bruce Fox, 
every good fortune.</p>

<p>This is my last report as Chairman as I too retire - with some
misgivings but happy in the knowledge that those remaining are
keen and that their efforts will ensure that the Industrial Group
continues to flourish and serve the industrial community. To all
who have supported me during my term of office, and to all who
have contributed to our success - thanks.<br>

<h1><a na
me="Chair94">CHAIRMAN'S REPORT for 1994</a></h1>

<h3>to the 1995 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h3>

Dr David Dyson reported :
 <p>
 Committee changes in April 1994 saw a number of new faces
joining the Committee for the first time. The present Committee
has tried to maintain the remit of the Group in furthering the
introduction and practical application of crystallographic
concepts and techniques in an industrial context. 

<p>In my opinion, the Group has achieved this succe
ssfully. In
saying this I must mention the efforts of Eric Kelly who, having
retired early from a long career in xrd, has been able to devote
the time and effort needed to represent the Group and do the
secretarial and treasurer's duties. In no way does this reflect
on the previous occupant of the post, Steve Norval, who still
brings his knowledge to the Committee.</p>

<p>We have tried to achieve two things this year. Firstly to
ensure that we attract members and provide them with the
necessary b
ackground knowledge to operate their equipment. We
consider this necessary because, often, the xrd analyst in an
industrial laboratory is not a crystallographer by training. To
this end, we have held a course in Reitveld Analysis (At King's
College London, organised by Jamshed Anwar) and shown where
public domain software can be obtained with a one-day meeting.
(At Daresbury, organised by your chairman.) The future will see a
two part course on Quantitative Analysis.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have tried
 to keep our members up to date with
what is happening in Industrial Crystallography laboratories
around the country. We have held an Autumn Meeting on problems
and solutions, which was organised in Swindon by Derrick Hart and
Bruce Fox. Two Sessions have been held at the current conference:
one on Applications of Reitveld techniques (A follow-up of the
course, but organised here by Craig Adam) and one on Novel
Materials, organised by Jo Jutson. In addition we have provided
the advanced course on th
e ICDD file, given again by our old
friend Ron Jenkins. The course was organised by David Taylor.
Only two Industrial posters have been submitted for the Spring
Meeting: the Committee has agreed that no poster prize be awarded
this year. The comments received about the programme have been
very favourable and the attendance at the sessions
encouraging.</p>

<p>All of this has been supplemented by two issues of the Group's
Newsletter, prepared and edited by Trevor Carter.</p>

<p>An Award has been 
made to Ian Ferguson, recognising his
contribution to our science and further nominations have
appeared.</p>

<p>While the numbers of practising industrial crystallographers
at the annual BCA Spring Meeting remain low, it is nice to see a
steady forty to fifty people attending our other meetings, often
with new faces among them. These meetings are often sponsored by
our friends the manufacturers of our equipment and I would like
to thank all of them for their continuing support, time and
effort in
 whatever form that they have freely given it. Thanks
are due, too, to our hosts at Raychem, Daresbury, BICC and King's
College London.</p>

<p>Finally, I am greatly indebted to all Committee members for
their continuing support and all their efforts. I believe that we
have a Group that is continuing to flourish.</p>
