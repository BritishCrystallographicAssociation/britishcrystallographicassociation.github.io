<h1><a name="Chair05">Chairman's Report for 2005</a></h1>
<h2>to the 2006 Annual General Meeting of the Industrial
Group.</h2>
<p><b>April 2006, University of Lancaster.</b></p>
<p>This is my second report as chairman of the Industrial Group.
Compared to 2004, this last year has been a quieter year with
regard to the number of meetings organised by the committee. In
the autumn, we organised a two day event in London held at
Birkbeck College, the first day of which was an introductory
workshop on the subject of "Patents &amp; Crystallography". The
second day formed, in effect, our usual 1 day autumn meeting.
This allowed us to develop the previous day's topic by making the
morning session "Crystallographic Patents". The afternoon session
was based on a mixture of talks revolved around the themes of
standards and applied crystallography. While there was an
excellent attendance on day 1, it was disappointing to see a
lower attendance on day 2 despite some really excellent talks. So
the whole issue of two day sessions is something that the
committee needs to look at very carefully in future.</p>
<p>At the last Spring Meeting, the industrial group decided to
take on the subject and responsibility of XRF by including a
series of parallel XRF sessions. One of the questions that arose
at our last AGM was the issue of how to include XRF within XRD
given the formal constitution of the group. It seems to the
committee that the simplest solution at this stage is to continue
XRF as a special interest group (SIG) within the BCA Industrial
Group analogous to our other SIGs (e.g. pharmaceutical, residual
stress, and non-ambient diffraction). In addition, there are
plans in progress to have a small-angle scattering SIG within the
BCA-IG, so watch this space!</p>
<p>So what else has the committee done? The BCA-IG has a very
active committee who meet in person on a regular basis, typically
3 times per year, in contrast to some of the other BCA groups.
This last year we have been fortunate to have had the use of
facilities at the Natural History Museum in London for our
committee meetings and I would like to express my personal thanks
to Martin Gill for both arranging these facilities plus the
additional tours including one to the diamond exhibition.
However, due to both time and costs, we plan to reduce the number
of committee meetings to twice per year since much of the
detailed discussions on future meetings can now be held
electronically.</p>
<p>The main activity of the committee is to organise meetings and
workshops of interest to the members, and a large number of the
sessions at this meeting were organised by IG committee members.
In addition, we already have plans afoot for our next autumn
meeting, to be held at Pilkington's research base at Lathom,
Lancashire. For those who have never been there, I strongly
recommend attendance since there will be an opportunity for a
fascinating guided tour. For the autumn meeting, we will be
reverting to our traditional theme of "Crystallography in
Industry", so if you are doing something interesting using
diffraction, let the committee know so that we include you in our
next programme. In addition, plans are now in place for the next
XRF meeting in May (see the website for details) plus a residual
stress meeting in June.</p>
<p>We do want to hear more about what our members are doing: so
one suggestion for the next BCA Spring Meeting in Canterbury,
Kent, is for a series of very short talks in which we will
encourage as many of our "silent" members as possible to tell us
in, say 5 to 10 minutes, about what they are doing in the field
of diffraction. So expect an email or two from us should we go
ahead with this idea!</p>
<p>The industrial group is incredibly fortunate to have the
services of Dave Taylor who is a pillar of support when it comes
to both the group's web pages and the newsletter. We really are
grateful for all the hard work that he puts into this job. For
many years the newsletter was the responsibility of our vice
chair, Phil Holdway, who has been on the committee since 1999,
both in the role of member and secretary-treasurer. Phil is now
standing down due to his other busy commitments at Qinetiq. At
this meeting we will be electing a new vice chair to take over
from Phil, so I would like to take this opportunity to thank Phil
for his work with the newsletter. Financially, we are also very
grateful to the various sponsors of our newsletter. Since the
last AGM, our two newsletters have been sponsored by PANalytical
and Rigaku, and I would like to thank both companies for their
support.</p>
<p>The committee is also involved with the subject of PXRD
standards and we have been fortunate to have the services of
Steve Norval to represent British interests here. In addition,
the BCA-IG had a round robin on the subject of low-angle
standards and I would like to thank Dave Taylor for organising
this. Reports on both subjects were given by Steve and Dave at
our last autumn meeting.</p>
<p>This meeting also sees the end of a 3 year period of office
for our secretary-treasurer, Judith Shackleton. It is not an easy
job chasing non-payers up for meeting fees, and I know that most
of the work has had to be done in her own free time at home. I
would like to thank her for all hard work. Fortunately, she has
agreed to stand again for committee, as the rules allow, but in a
different role. Finally, I would like to thank all the committee
members for their help and support during the last year.</p>
<p>This ends the Chairman's report for the year 2005.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair06">Chairman's Report for 2006</a></h1>
<h2>delivered at the AGM at the University of Kent, April
2007.</h2>
<p>This is my third and final report as chairman of the
Industrial Group. I will try to keep this report short. Firstly,
I have been on the BCA Industrial Group committee for many years
now, in fact longer than I care to think about having started off
as an ordinary member and then "risen through the ranks to the
position of chairman". I do strongly encourage other members who,
even if they may feel that they have little to offer initially,
to serve as committee members. It is very healthy for all
committees to experience new blood and everyone has something to
offer.</p>
<p>The main activity of the committee is to organise meetings and
workshops of interest to the members, and a large number of the
sessions at this meeting were organised by IG committee members.
In particular, as mentioned in my previous chairman's reports,
the industrial group has taken on XRF "under its wing" and 2 of
our committee members, namely David Beveridge and Dave Taylor
have been very active in promoting this complementary technique
by organising a parallel set of XRF sessions at this year's BCA
Spring Meeting. I hope this can be maintained in future years,
and a planned 1 day XRF meeting for 2008 is already underway.</p>
<p>With regard to meetings held last year, the BCA had a
well-attended autumn meeting held at Pilkington's research base
at Lathom, Lancashire. Personally, it was certainly a pleasure,
not only to hear a set of interesting talks, but to see
Pilkington's research exhibition. I'm sure all those who attended
enjoyed the visit and I would like to thank Mark Farnworth for
the organisation and Pilkington's for the hospitality shown to
all those who attended. Many thanks!</p>
<p>Our next autumn meeting on 7th and 8th November 2007 will be
held at our AstraZeneca's Alderley Park site set in the middle of
lovely the Cheshire countryside. It will be a 2 day event with a
pharmaceutical SIG held on day 1 and with our usual autumn
meeting on day 2. The themes for the autumn meeting will be
applications of Rietveld and more general crystallography in
industry. If you feel you can contribute in anyway, do contact
the organisers (and full details are on the BCA IG web site). So
don't "sit on the sidelines" and just wait to be invited! The BCA
Industrial Group has had mixed successes with 2 day events from
highly successful to a poorly attended one at Birkbeck College a
few years ago. Hopefully this year will we have a good attendance
on both days.</p>
<p>The BCA Industrial Group has several special interest groups.
We still have interests in residual stress and one of our
committee members, Judith Shackleton, organised a workshop with
the British Society for Strain Measurement earlier this year. As
mentioned in my last report, a new SIG is small angle scattering
led by our vice-chairman, Richard Morris. We plan to hold a 2-day
meeting in early July. Unusually for the BCA IG, this meeting
will be held outside the UK at the European neutron and
synchrotron facilities in Grenoble, France. Many meetings are
held at RAL in Oxfordshire, but given cheap airfares, Grenoble is
easy to get to and the cost of holding a meeting at European
facilities (for which the UK is paid up member) is not expensive,
so we strongly encourage anyone with interests in this area to
attend. It will also be an opportunity to view neutron and
synchrotron facilities for those who have never seen them and
perhaps for those wanting to take their partners, to have a long
weekend either in Grenoble or in the surrounding French
Alpes.</p>
<p>I realize that I haven't yet mentioned all of the committee by
name. For example, Roy Copley has been the Industrial Group
representative on the Spring Meeting programme committee and
Steve Norval continues to represent British interests in the
field of European PXRD standards. For those joining the
committee, you will soon find yourself with a role to play.</p>
<p>Again this last year we have been fortunate to have had the
use of facilities at the Natural History Museum in London for our
committee meetings and I would like to express my personal thanks
to Martin Gill for both arranging these facilities plus the
additional tours. As mentioned in my last report, it is now
planned to have just two committee meetings per year since much
of the detailed discussions on future meetings can now be held
electronically and this will enable money save to be spent, say,
on inviting promising speakers from further a field or let young
people in industry attend events.</p>
<p>The industrial group is incredibly fortunate to have the
services of Dave Taylor who is a pillar of support when it comes
to both the group's web pages and the newsletter. We really are
grateful for all the hard work that he puts into this job.
Financially, we are also very grateful to the various sponsors of
our newsletter. Since the last AGM, our two newsletters have been
sponsored by Bruker and PANalytical, and I would like to thank
both companies for their support. I should add that the various
X-ray companies support us not just financially, but most are
good at sending representatives to our various 1- and 2-day
meetings.</p>
<p>As this meeting sees the end of my 3 year period in office,
I'm fortunate in knowing that the group will continue in healthy
hands. I wish our new chairman every success for the next 3 years
and will continue to offer my services to the group, if only from
the sidelines. Already I have been roped in with helping out at
the Grenoble meeting, having worked at the site for the whole of
the 1980s, and with this year's autumn meeting too, so this no
immediate rest even for a retiring chairman. So Anne, be
warned!</p>
<p>This ends the Chairman's report for the year 2006.</p>

<h1><a name="Chair07">Chairman's Report for 2007</a></h1>
<h2>delivered at the AGM at the University of York, April
2008.</h2>
<p>This is my first report as chairman of the IG, and I am
pleased to report on a very productive year for the IG, in which
all the members of the committee, and a few non-members as well,
have been active. However, despite all this, I shall keep this
report short.</p>
<p>As Jeremy Cockcroft pointed out in his outgoing address last
year, the main activity of the committee is to organise meetings
and workshops of interest to the members of the IG, and the past
year has seen several examples of this.</p>
<p>However, before I mention past and future meetings I'd like to
thank some particular individuals. As well as organising
meetings, the IG issues a newsletter, and I would like to thank
our editor, Mark Farnworth for all his sterling efforts, and
patience with contributors such as myself. Our website is
maintained in amazingly up-to-date fashion by Dave Taylor, on top
of his usual, considerable role in organising meetings. Both the
newsletter and website are invaluable in presenting the work of
the IG to the wider community. I'd also like to thank David
Beveridge for all his work as Honorary Treasurer/Secretary to the
committee.</p>
<p>In July 2007, the IG held a meeting on SAXS at the ILL in
Grenoble; this was our first-ever non-UK event; and was organised
by Richard Morris, Dave Taylor and Jeremy Cockcroft (who had
already realised that stepping down as chairman would not be the
end of his IG involvement). The meeting attracted delegates and
speakers from the UK and Europe, as well as participants from the
ILL. One of very pleasing side effect of this meeting was that
Michela Brunelli from the ILL came over to the UK to speak at our
Autumn meeting.</p>
<p>In Autumn 2007, a back-to-back meetings were held at
AstraZeneca, Macclesfield; a general industrial day and a Pharma
SIG, with the subject of structure determination and refinement
from powder data provided a bridge between the two. Both sessions
were very well attended: ~50 for the Industrial meeting and ~70
for the Pharma SIG. Organisers and session chairs were: Steve
Norval and Judith Shackleton for the Industrial day, and myself
and Roy Copley for the Pharma SIG. These meetings always require
local help on the day, and I had considerable help from my AZ
colleagues.</p>
<p>We are now about &frac34; of the way through the 2008 Spring
meeting, the IG have organised sessions on pharmaceutical
hydrates, an Industrial Showcase, and awarded a prize for the
best oral contribution from the YC workshop. Later today we have
more sessions devoted to industrial applications of
crystallography. Session organisers for these have been Chris
Staddon, Steve Norval and Judith Shackleton. Plus the 'usual
suspects' (myself and Roy) for the pharma strand.</p>
<p>Looking forward to later this year, we have back-to-back
meetings in May for the XRF SIG (jointly with the RSC) and a
joint meeting with the BGS on Minerals, to be held at the BGS in
Keyworth. I'd like to thank the organisers David Beveridge, Dave
Taylor and Martin Gill for their work here: the programs can be
found on the website, and look very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>In November we will have an IG meeting at AZ Charnwood; the
topic has yet to be decided, but there will certainly be a
considerable pharmaceutical element. More details will be found
on the website in the near future.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a grateful farewell to Roy
Copley, who has served on the committee for the last 3 years,
including as IG rep on the organising committee for the Spring
meeting. We will all miss Roy and hope to see him again in the
near future.</p>
<p>This ends the Chairman's report for the year 2007.</p>
