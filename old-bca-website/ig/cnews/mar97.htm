<h2>Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry</h2>

<h3>Authors: Ron Jenkins and Robert L. Snyder</h3>

Publisher:John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1996 403 pages Price:
&pound;65 in the UK (hardback) ISBN 0-471-51339-3<br>
<p>As might be expected, Jenkins and Snyder have written a really
useful book. It covers basic crystallography, production of
X-rays, instrumentation, sample preparation, data collection and
reduction, phase identification and quantitativ p
hase analysis.
The book concentrates on Bragg-Brentano geometry, being the most
common for routine work, and is very practical describing how to
get started once you are in the lab with your sample.</p>

<p>Many students use powder diffraction as one of several
different techniques to c haracterise materials. For them the
chapters on sample preparation, data collection and redu ction,
phase identification, databases and quantitative phase analysis
give a clear and comprehensive guide of how to find
 out what
crystalline phases are in the sample. There are diagrams and flow
charts to illustrate the steps in data reduction and phase
identification respec tively as well as tables which show the
effect of errors. Descriptions of what lies behind commercial
software for finding peak positions and identifying crystalline
phases are helpful, particularly for the occasions when the black
box (on default settings) might not give the correct answer.</p>

<p>I believe that most of the information on dif
fractometer
alignment has not appeared before in a textbook. With the recent
round-robin tests showing that many diffractometers are not
optimally aligned this is very timely, particularly as the
participants of such tests are likely to be more conscientious
than the many other non-participants. The disappointment in this
chapter is that the descriptions all relate to a family of
Philips diffractometers and it would have been good to cover a
wider range of instruments. The discussion of systematic

aberrations and choice of slits is instructive with more clear
diagrams. Routine instrumental checks and the use of standards
also rarely appear in textbooks. They tend to be considered by
laboratories that concentrate on X-ray work or are seeking some
sort of accreditation and are unfortunately forgotten or never
considered by others. For anyone trying to get the best out of a
diffractometer and wanting to have an understanding of possible
errors, these chapters are most helpful.</p>

<p>As well a
s including new material, the book draws on recent
and old literature. There are some historical descriptions which
add interest without obscuring the main aim of hel ping people to
do powder diffraction. The book is titled $Introduction$ and thus
there is little or no mention of profile analysis, texture
measurements, glancing angle work, residual strain, indexing,
structure determination and the use of synchrotron or neutron
sources. A companion volume is planned in which one expects that
such top
ics will be addressed.</p>

<p>If you have a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer which is being
used for powder diffraction, I recommend that you obtain a copy
of this book.</p>

Powder Diffraction: J. Ian Langford and Daniel Lou&euml;r<br>
Rep. Prog. Phys, vol 59, No 2 (February 1996), pages 131 -
234.<br>
<p>1997 will mark 30 years since the development of the Rietveld
method whic
h, according to Langford and Lou&euml;r, was one of
the main factors responsible for the renaissance of powder
diffraction methods. The breadth and scope of this review article
clearly reflect the power and applicability of such techniques
today, in the characterisation of modern materials at the atomic
level. It is also apparent that this renaissance is far from
complete; future developments are likely to increase further the
versatility and scope of powder techniques.</p>

<p>For the industrial c
rystallographer in particular, there was a
previous renaissance 30 years before Rietveld when the work of
Hanawalt et al. conceived the forerunner of the PDF. The topic of
qualitative phase identification is only one of many covered by
Langford and Lou&euml;r in their review of developments in powder
diffraction in recent times.</p>

<p>The review is accessible to all users and researchers in
powder diffraction as the basic principles, aspects of
instrumentation and experimental considerations are 
well
described, yet the authors lead us through to recent
state-of-the-art developments and applications. Of course, many
of the key advances in the technique in recent years are in those
areas where the authors themselves have played leading roles;
namely in total pattern fitting, line profile analysis, indexing
and ab initio structure determination. These are fully reviewed,
starting with fundamental principles and clearly describing how
the contributions from various workers have evolved into tod
ay's
interpretative techniques.</p>

<p>Although brief mention is made of synchrotron and neutron
sources, the theme of the review is the powder technique itself,
irrespective of the source used; this inevitably leads to a bias
towards laboratory X-ray examples, reflecting the volume of work
in this area.</p>

<p>Each section is illustrated by examples taken from key papers.
For example, the use of Rietveld refinement in structural studies
on High Tc superconductors. The discussion of line profil
e
analysis is, not surprisingly, thorough and includes the classic
example of direction dependant effects in ZnO. The treatment of
ab initio structural studies is fully up-to-date with mention of
maximum entropy, simulated annealing, lattice energy minimisation
and anomalous dispersion approaches, among others. The topics of
non-ambient diffraction, dynamic diffraction and, in particular,
diffraction at high pressures make a welcome appearance and
include examples using conventional sources and neut
rons as well
as synchrotron X-rays.</p>

<p>A concise section on quantitative phase analysis includes
conventional methods as well as Rietveld-based approaches. This
account is well referenced and has a short account of
applications. Indeed one of the main purposes of a review such as
this is to allow ready access to the key publications in a
particular area of work; the comprehensive set of references
appended to this article will satisfy anyone with this purpose in
mind. The concluding section o
f the review summarises well the
past successes of powder diffraction and what were the key
developments. Some indication is also given of the future. This
includes the increasing ease of experimentation on individual
grains of a polycrystalline sample leading to a convergence of
powder and single crystal methods. The future of the technique in
the characterisation of real materials does indeed seem
secure.<br>

The 'Reports on the Progress in Physics' is one
of the journals published by the Institute of Physics, details
can most easily found via their World Wide Web pages at URL: <a
href="http://www.iop.org/">http://www.iop.org/</a> The price
varies, non-members may pay as much as &pound;55 for a single
issue, members get reduced rates for IoP journals, about half
that sum. If your Institute subscribes to the paper version of
the journal, you can read the first few pages of any electronic
version of articl
es for nothing via the Internet, and can
download all of it for later printing at your own site.</p>
