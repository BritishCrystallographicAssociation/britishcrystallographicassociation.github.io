<strong><a name="p26">Introduction</a> to Physical Chemistry
(Third Edition)</strong><br>
<em>Author:</em> Mark Ladd, University of Surrey<br>
<em>Publisher:</em> Cambridge University Press 1998<br>
ISBN 0 521 48000 0 (hardbound) &pound;65 ISBN 0 521 57881 7 (pbk)
&pound;22.95<br>
</p>

<p>This is a general Physical Chemistry textbook intended f
or
undergraduates in their first and second years of a Chemistry
B.Sc. It covers all the usual topics such as quantum mechanics,
thermodynamics and kinetics. Chapter 3 is of particular interest
as it covers first point group symmetry, with a startling picture
of a large Doberman dog as an illustration of
<em>s<sub>n</sub></em> symmetry, immediately followed by a
description of crystal symmetry. This arrangement works well. The
description of X-ray crystallographic analysis, later in the same
chapte
r, is beautifully written and a model of conciseness,
covering all the major topics from the Bragg equation through to
the representation of electron density by a Fourier series, with
equations, all in just 16 pages. Unfortunately, I feel that this
may be its Achilles heel, as the average first, or even second
year student is likely to encounter problems when learning from
such a compact text. Unfortunately, the description also omits
any mention of powder diffraction, or neutron diffraction and has

missed the opportunity of guiding students to computer databases
of structures, which have been available for some time.<br>
</p>

<p>Generally I found the book a little old fashioned. In the
quantum mechanics chapter, there is only one paragraph on
tunnelling, and this fails to mention the scanning tunnelling
microscope (STM), a rather serious omission since the STM is the
only technique by which individual atoms can be directly observed
and manipulated. I also feel that the use of a pair of
hea
dphones, to obtain a balance on a Wheatstone bridge when
measuring the resistance of an electrolyte, may give the student
the wrong impression of current technology. There is also no
material on statistical thermodynamics, reaction dynamics or
lasers and only a mention of surface chemistry; but perhaps these
are third or fourth year subjects.<br>
</p>

<p>When compared with similar texts such as P.W. Atkins,
"Physical Chemistry", 6th Edn., and G.M. Barrows, "Physical
Chemistry", 6th Edn, which hav
e a similar price, it is clear that
this "Introduction to Physical Chemistry" is shorter, as would be
expected from its title. Interestingly, Atkins and Ladd's books
are the first two I have encountered which try hard to utilise
computers as learning aids. Ladd gives a world wide web (WWW)
address<br>
<strong>ftp://ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk/pub/science/outgoing/Ladd/READ.DOC</strong>
from which programs can be downloaded and run, which presupposes
that the student has access to an internetted PC, while Atki
ns
provides a CD with the book, which presupposes a CD drive on the
PC. The use of a WWW address has the advantage over the CD that
it can be updated easily, while the CD has the advantage of
immediacy and moving graphics. This is the beginning of a new
trend and it will be interesting to see where it goes. In the
future, will we buy a CD with WWW addresses in it and no
book?</p>

<p>Having been somewhat critical of Mark Ladds "Introduction to
Physical Chemistry", I must end on a positive note. Th
e chapter
which deals with the solid state is excellent.</p>

<p>It combines the solid state physics of band structures and
free electron theory, with structural descriptions which are more
usually the province of inorganic chemistry. This is unusual in a
general physical chemistry text and is a definite high point of
the book.</p>

<p><strong><em>Editor's Notes:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I
 have downloaded some of the WWW problems for the student.
They run under DOS, which has the advantage that you do not need
the latest variety of 'Microsoft Windows' on your PC to try the
exercises. The programs are written in Fortran77, so should be
portable to other computers. If there is sufficient demand I may
be able to help do this for VAX/VMS systems or for Acorn RISC
microcomputers.<br>
If you have the book beside you the problems look useful.
However, if you get stuck and want to download t
he solutions you
may need some variety of 'Windows' because they are written in
Adobe PDF format. (PDF viewers are freely available via the
Internet if you do not have one.) I understand the publisher may
send out printed paper copies of the solutions on request to
purchasers of the book.</li>

<p><strong><a name="p51">A Practical</a> Gui
de for the Preparation
of Specimens<br>
 for X-Ray Fluorescence and X-Ray Diffraction
Analysis</strong><br>
<em>Edited by:</em> V. E. Buhrke, R. Jenkins, D.K. Smith<br>
<em>Publisher:</em> John Wiley &amp; Sons 1998 333 pages<br>
<em>Price (hardback)</em> &pound;65 ISBN 0 471 19458 1 

<p>This new book is aimed at the practical scientist, both
beginner and experienced, who needs to extract a sample from a
bulk material and prepare a representative homogeneous specimen
for analysis. The 31 contrib
utors impart some necessary
repetition, but overall the book has a logical flow and is easy
to read.</p>

<p>The coverage of a wide range of materials is split in favour
of those used for X-Ray Diffraction. Although this review
concentrates on the Diffraction aspects many of the comments are
equally applicable to the Fluorescence content. The book starts
with a general introduction covering basic statistics, obtaining
a representative sample from a bulk, grinding, absorption,
crystallinity and par
ticle effects and includes 26
references.<br>
The 88 pages of Chapters 2 &amp; 3 cover Fluorescence and contain
147 references. Chapters 4-7 are dedicated to Diffraction and
span 141 pages with 114 references.</p>

<p>The coverage is detailed and for beginners will provide all
the information needed to embark on the preparation of powder
diffraction specimens. The experienced user may find that the
coverage of their particular speciality falls short of their
expectations. However, for procedures a
nd materials that are
unfamiliar, the book will be invaluable. Materials covered
include metals, minerals, clays, zeolites, forensics, paper,
reactive, toxic, radioactive and explosive. Preparation
techniques are included for small samples and thin films. The new
aerosol suspension technique is described well with good
supporting diagrams. A whole chapter is devoted specifically to
specimens for cameras and there are sections on high-pressure
studies and synchrotron radiation. Chapter 8 covers the e
quipment
necessary for sample preparation for both techniques. It includes
lists of equipment required and vendor addresses. The final
chapter is devoted to X-Ray Fluorescence Standards and
instrumental dricorrection.</p>

<p>Many laboratories that use both techniques and only buy one
copy because of the high price in the UK, might have a conflict
of ownership. If I have a criticism it has to be the US bias in
the materials and suppliers lists. Has anyone in the UK heard of
Tackiwax or Cow gum? Fi
nding an item of interest is sometimes
difficult with the list of contents often being more useful than
the index. The book should be read from cover to cover and not
just used for reference.This text is ideally suited for
conversion to a multimedia CD-ROM with video clips of the various
preparation procedures. Web links could provide updated
information, references and country specific supplier
information.</p>

<p>Many scientists spend too little time on specimen preparation,
preferring to devot
e their time to the more interesting and
rewarding data processing aspects. Their results can be
unreliable because specimens are not reproducible or
representative. Following the principles outlined in this book
will produce good specimens and lay the foundations for
analytical reliability. This book is a must for the reference
shelves of all X-ray analysis laboratories.</p>
