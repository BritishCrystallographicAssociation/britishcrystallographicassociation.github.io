<strong>From the President</strong><br>
</p>

<hr>
<p
><br>
 Those of you who attended the recent BCA Spring Meeting held in
St Andrews will, I am sure, wish to congratulate the organisers
for holding such a memorable conference. There were many
highlights, including, in my opinion, four excellent
presentations from each of the groups given in a single Plenary
Session. Phil Lightfoot even managed to arrange for the right
sort of Scottish weather that ensured full attendance at all the
sessions!</p>

<p>Now it is important to realize that <strong>next
 year there
will be no Spring Meeting,</strong> because instead we shall be
putting our efforts into the IUCr Meeting in Glasgow. It is most
important that we show UK crystallography at its best, and I
would urge all BCA members to consider how they can contribute to
this meeting next year. In particular, Judith Howard would like
to hear as soon as possible of any suggestions for the programme,
so please contact her with ideas for plenary speakers and
microsymposium topics and conveners.</p>

<p>I
t is with great pleasure that I congratulate our second
oldest member, Arnold Beevers, on his 90th birthday, and George
Bacon on his 80th!</p>

<b>From the Treasurer</b><br>
</p>

<hr>
<p>The Annual General Meeting of the BCA, held at St. Andrews,
voted in favour of a proposal to increase the annual subscription
fee for BCA membership. (The Minutes of the AGM follow on page
6)<br>
</p>

<p
>From January 1st 1999, membership fees will rise as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>ordinary member - &pound;15 (from &pound;12)</li>

<li>student / retired / unemployed - &pound;7.50 (from
&pound;6)</li>

<li>payment by credit card - as above</li>

<li>payment by standing order (ordinary member) - &pound;12 (from
&pound;10)</li>

<li>payment by standing order (student / retired / unemployed) -
&pound;6 (from &pound;5)</li>

<li>5-year term payment - &pound;60 (from &pound;50)</li>
</ul>

<p>The
 decision to raise the fee, for the first time in 5 years,
has been taken for a number of reasons. Many of the BCA's
activities, including those from the individual groups, are
self-financing or are used to specifically finance other
activities - the purpose of the membership subscription has
always been to finance the administration of the Association and
the Newsletter. While the slice of this amount required to
subsidise "Crystallography News" has decreased as advertising
revenue has increased, t
here are now other demands upon that
amount.</p>

<p>Our annual payment of &pound;2,200 to the Royal Society for
IUCr subscription is a case in point, and we are now members of
the European Crystallographic Association, which also requires an
annual subscription fee. Furthermore, a decision was made by
Council not to specifically increase the amount paid by credit
card subscriptions to allow for the commission which is payable
on each transaction. Thus administrative costs have risen in real
terms
.</p>

<p>We therefore hope that the membership will bear with us, as we
maintain and improve the services we provide to members. This
extra subscription revenue, for example, is enabling us to
provide members with a credit card payment facility and automatic
membership of the European Crystallographic Association.</p>

<p>Those members who currently pay by Standing Order Mandate
(SOM) will need to replace their current mandate with a new one.
You will find a form enclosed as an insert with the Ju
ne 98
issue. Please complete the relevant sections (note there is one
that the BCA Treasurer needs to complete - please leave this
blank) and return it as soon as possible to<br>
Dr. Stephanie Harris at Worcester. This is also an ideal
opportunity to start paying by SOM for those who have not done so
before. First payments will be made on the first working day of
1999.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for your co-operation and
forebearance.</p>

<strong>Minutes of the BCA Annual General Meeting 1998<br>
</strong></big></p>

<hr>
<p><em>held on Tuesday 7 April in the Physics Building,
University of St Andrews at 5.00 p.m. with the President,
Professor Michael Glazer, in the Chair.</em></p>

<p>1. The <strong>agenda</strong> was approved.</p>

<p>2. There were no <strong>apologies for absence</strong>.</p>

<p>3. The <strong>minutes</strong> of the previous AGM
 (held at
Leeds on 16 April 1997) had been published in the June 1997 issue
of <em>Crystallography News</em> and posted during the
conference. They were approved and signed by the President. There
were no <strong>matters arising</strong> from them.</p>

<p>4. The <strong>Secretary's Report to Council</strong>, which
had been published in the March 1998 issue of <em>Crystallography
News</em> as well as having been posted during the conference,
was accepted.</p>

<p>5. Two proposed changes to the B
y-Laws of the British
Crystallographic Association were discussed.</p>

<p>By-Law D4 (<strong>General Meetings</strong>) was amended to
read 'The examined accounts shall be made available to Members at
least two days before the date of the Annual General Meeting,
preferably with the agenda paper'. Normally this would mean that
they should be displayed at the beginning of the Spring
Meeting.</p>

<p>Council had proposed that By-Law E2 (Nominations and
Elections) should be amended to read that nomi
nations must be
received by the Secretary not less than <strong>seven
days</strong> before the Annual General Meeting. This proposal
was defeated and the time will remain at <strong>two
days</strong>.</p>

<p>It was agreed in principle that the standard term of office
for elected Members of Council should be three years and that the
Immediate Past President should be a Member of Council <em>ex
officio</em> for one year. Proposed changes to the Statutes and
By-Laws would be brought to the next AGM.
 This change would not
affect the position of Group Representatives or <em>ex
officio</em> members.</p>

<p>6. Copies of the <strong>Treasurer's Report</strong> were
given to all members present. Dr Steve Maginn drew attention to
the fact that overall the BCA has made a small operating surplus
of &pound;866, as opposed to a small loss in 1996. For the first
time the turnover of the BCA has exceeded &pound;100,000. This is
attributable to the 1997 Durham Teaching School, which had a
turnover in exc
ess of &pound;20,000. The separation of
'Crystallography Congress 1999' funds took place in January
1997.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Presentation of Accounts</strong>. The amount spent
on bursaries during the year was &pound;4630, matching the profit
of &pound;5408 made by the Leeds Spring Meeting. The Leeds
University Conference Office and the local organiser, Dr Mark
Thornton-Pett, were thanked for the quick and efficient
production of accounts.</p>

<p>The income from newsletter advertising has increa
sed sharply
due to both an increase in advertising rates, and in the number
of advertisers. All credit to Kate Crennell for the fact that the
Newsletter is now regularly breaking even.</p>

<p>Membership subscriptions have fallen. This is partly because
of the change in status and payment of the CCG and PCG, and
partly because more members are paying by standing order, which
costs them less. Credit card payments also incur a small
penalty.</p>

<p>The accounts include a payment of &pound;2200 to 
the Royal
Society to reimburse them for part of the subscription to the
International Union.</p>

<p>Mr R Husband, who has been the examining accountant, is
retiring from practice. Mr R A Young of The Young Company,
Huntingdon was appointed as Examining Accountant in his place.
The accounts were accepted <em>nem con</em>. Council recommended
the raising of subscription fees to &pound;15, &pound;12 and
&pound;6 respectively for full membership, payment by standing
order, and reduced fee membership 
and an increase to &pound;60
for term payments. This was approved with one vote against.</p>

<p>8. <strong>Election of Officers and Ordinary Members of
Council</strong></p>

<p><em>For President</em> - Professor Michael Glazer had been
proposed by Dr Steve Maginn and seconded by Dr Hilary Muirhead.
As his was the only nomination, he was declared duly elected.</p>

<p><em>For Treasurer</em> - Dr Steve Maginn had been proposed by
Dr Leo Brady and seconded by Dr Sandy Blake. As his was the only
no
mination, he was declared duly elected.</p>

<p><em>For Ordinary Member of Council</em> - One nomination had
been received to fill one vacancy. Professor Guy Orpen had been
proposed by Professor Michael Hursthouse and seconded by Dr Frank
Allen. As his was the only nomination, he was declared duly
elected.</p>

<p>Dr Chris Gilmore and Professor Judith Howard have been
co-opted as Members of Council.</p>

<p>9. The <strong>Examining Accountant</strong> had already been
appointed under item 7.</p>


<p>10. Under <strong>Any Other Business</strong> the matter of
named lectures was raised. The president said that the Lonsdale
Lecture had been given last year and that the next one would
probably be in the year 2000. There would be a Bragg Lecture next
year but this was not organised by the BCA.</p>

<h2>News of Kathleen Lonsdale</h2>

<hr>
<p>Thanks to Alan Mackay for sending this cutting from '<em>The
Guardian</em>' of March 11th 1998:</p>

<p>I was intr
igued by the statistic in Peter Gorman's letter
(March 7) that in 1996-7 "while 11% of people in England and
Wales are Roman Catholic, 17% of those in prison are".</p>

<p>My mother, Kathleen Lonsdale, spent a month in Holloway prison
in 1943. She was a Quaker and had refused to pay a fine for not
registering for firewatching. On arrival a friendly inmate
whispered that it was best to register as a Roman Catholic. They
were issued with bibles with red covers, which, if wetted, could
produce a passa
ble substitute for lipstick. Protestants were
given blue-covered bibles.</p>

<p>My mother used this anecdote to illustrate the pitfalls of
interpreting statistics.</p>

<h1>The Amazing Dorothy Hodgkin</h1>

<p>A leaflet about Dorothy Hodgkin was enclosed with this June 98
newsletter, it has been provided by the <strong>Oxford
International Women's Collective</strong> to publicise their
Appeal for funds to
 erect some form of memorial to Dorothy in
Oxford where she did much of her research work. I asked BCA
members at St.Andrews what sort of memorial they thought Dorothy
would have liked. They all thought she would not have wanted a
sculpture of herself, preferring the money to be spent to help
others. I have been asked to join the committee deciding on the
memorial, so I will try to keep you informed of our progress.</p>

<h1>New Web Pages on BCA site for '<em>in-situ</em>'
diffraction</h1>

<hr>
<p>In most diffraction experiments the sample is prepared well
before the experiment and brought to the diffractometer. However,
there are many circumstances in structural chemistry, physics,
engineering, biology and earth sciences where such a procedure
may not be possible. The sample may only be formed in a reactive
environment and the preparation or transformation is best carried
out on the instrumen
t itself. The scope for such
<em>'in-situ'</em> diffraction experiments has increased
enormously over recent years as more intense sources of X-rays
and neutrons have enabled experiments to be carried out on
smaller samples or faster transformations, or in environments
that provide poorer access to the probe.</p>

<p>Many of these are industrially important as we heard from the
'Industrial Group' plenary session speaker at the St.Andrews
meeting, Patrick Fairclough, who is studying polymer
crystal
lisation. Another classic example of this kind of work is
that of Pannetier and his colleagues on the chemical and
structural changes that occur deep inside a solid-state battery
as it discharges and the cell reaction proceeds. Neutron
diffraction provides a direct probe of these processes in real
time in the chemical environment most relevant to the
problem.</p>

<p>A wide range of problems is currently being studied in this
way; they are mainly in solid-state chemistry and materials
processing a
t the moment, but the idea is extending into the
biological and earth sciences. As an emerging field, the topic
needs to bring together those who have the technical expertise to
perform the diffraction experiments, and those who have a problem
to solve in this area of structural science.</p>

<p>Therefore, it has been proposed that a Web Page be set up on
the BCA Web site to provide an information source on techniques
and facilities, areas of activity and practitioners, for experts
and would-be use
rs. Andrew Harrison and Kate Crennell are setting
up a draft page at URL:</p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong><a href=
"http://gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/insitu/Index.htm">http://gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/insitu/Index.htm</a></strong></p>

<p align="left">We hope it will be there ready for your
inspection by the time this newsletter is published. (Sorry, not
there yet, we're working on it KMC,and AH)</p>

<p>The page will focus initially on activities in the UK,
concentrating on neutron diffraction a
nd X-ray techniques, with
links to the more specialised information held at the CLRC
Laboratories by the ISIS Facility and the SRS Daresbury; we plan
further pages on activities in selected subject areas -
solid-state chemistry for example - with links to those doing
such work. Please look at the pages we have already -
particularly the ones which are merely outline contributions,
they aim to give an introduction providing a framework to link to
more detailed contributions from active workers in the
 field.</p>

<p>Let us know what other subjects you would like to see covered.
In future we hope to extend the scope of the activities and
practitioners beyond the UK and may also consider other
structural probes such as EXAFS.</p>
