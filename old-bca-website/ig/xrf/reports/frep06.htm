<h3>Morning Session</h3>
<p><strong>Welcome<br>
<i>Dave Taylor, BCA Industrial Group</i></strong></p>

<p>Dave provided the welcome for the day from the Industrial Group of the BCA 
for this first joint XRF meeting with the RSC Atomic Spectroscopy Group.  
He thanked all the sponsors for their kind contributions. Dave then commented 
that the aim of bringing together an independent UK forum for XRF appeared to 
be bearing fruit with 70 delegates registered for the meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction &amp; tour of BGS<br>
<i>Charles Gowing, British Geological Survey.</i></strong>
</p>
<p>Owing to Mark Ingham having lost his voice, Charles Gowing kindly stepped 
in to the breach by providing the introduction. He ran through the usual 
formalities of safety and continued with a review of the day's agenda.<br>
<img align= "left" hspace="10" vspace="10" height="313" width="494"alt="Photo Mobile lab (71K)" src=
"../Meetings/06slide/BGSML.gif" border="0" > 
The whole group then split into two for a tour of the British Geological 
Survey XRF facilities.
The laboratory itself was well equipped with PANalytical XRF instrumentation. 
In daily use are 3 WDXRF instruments - a PW2400, a MagixPro and a new Axios. 
On the EDXRF side was an Epsilon 5, used when Rh excitation becomes limited 
e.g. for Sb analysis etc.
Outside in the sunshine we were given a tour round the BGS's newly converted 
mobile laboratory. 
It is equipped with both a bench top and handheld EDXRF systems. So far the 
lab has been successfully trialled locally 
but has not been put to full use in the field.
We all returned to the meeting room for the remainder of the day.<br clear="left"></p>

<p><strong>Chair, Morning Session<br>
<i>Andy Scothern, RSC.</i></strong></p>

<p>Andy took the opportunity to inform the delegates of the 13th Biennial 
National Atomic Spectroscopy Symposium being held at Glasgow Caledonian 
University from 10th to 12th July organised by the Atomic Spectroscopy 
Group of the RSC. He then introduced the keynote speaker Dany Doyen.
</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Lecture - From Catalyst to Final Product: An overview 
of XRF analytical and sample preparation techniques in a leading European 
R&amp;D polymer laboratory.<br>
<i>Dany Doyen, INEOS Polyolefins, Belgium.</i></strong><br>

<p>Dany began his talk with a brief history of INEOS Polyolefins plus an 
overview of the company as it is today.<br>
<img align= "left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Presentation Slide DD (32K)" src=
"../Meetings/06slide/DD.gif" border="0" >
INEOS have a range of analytical techniques that are available in the business 
so why choose XRF. It is a robust and reliable technique with pros and cons.<br>
A wide range of sample types are analysed at INEOS. These include catalysts, 
additives, polymers, deposits and defaults (problems). As the majority of the 
samples are polymeric a 1kW Bruker system with a He atmosphere is used otherwise 
both standards and samples would be destroyed by the beam. Difficulties arise 
for the analysis of P, S, Cl and Si, which migrate to the surface of hot 
pressed films. INEOS get around this by cutting away the surface prior to 
measurement in their XRF.<br> 
A range of sample preparation techniques are employed. Catalysts are measured 
in solution. Additives such as TiO2 are analysed for their Ti content as pressed 
pellets and sometimes, especially for pure TiO<sub>2</sub>, fused beads are used 
with Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as flux. Dany then covered a range 
of INEOS specific applications and solutions.<br>
Validation of their XRF is carried out twice weekly and monitored using a 
control chart. Using these data decisions are taken as to when drift correction 
is required. Also, every quarter, these data are shared between the different 
control labs around the INEOS facilities to monitor the company agreement.<br>
Dany concluded that WDXRF provides a rapid analysis for a competitive price.

<p><strong>A Discussion on the Estimation of Uncertainties in XRF Measurements<br>
<i>Ros Schwarz, , London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co Ltd.</i></strong></p>

<p>Ros introduced her talk by explaining that she is not an expert in statistics 
but believes it is important for the analytical community to have an 
understanding and apply it as appropriate. <br>
At , London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co Ltd the range of sample types is vast and Ros would like to be able to 
estimate the uncertainty associated with an XRF measurement so that she can 
optimise her analysis parameters without spending a vast amount of time running 
through repeatability/reproducibility exercises. Her aim is to find a simple 
way to calculate an uncertainty estimate of any element in any matrix.<br>
Documentation Ros has referred to has been the Eurachem/Citac guide and 
BS EN ISO 12677:2003. Chemical analysis of refractory products by XRF - 
fused cast bead method.<br>
For her initial work Ros has assumed that instrument uncertainty and 
sample preparation uncertainty are not correlated. The factors she is 
concentrating on are instrumental variance, the detector and counting 
error/statistics. She is then using this for modelling for changing counting 
rates. Ros then asked for feedback on her ideas to date and any suggestions on 
how to apply this idea to matrix corrections which led to useful discussion.</p>

<p><b>How Corus Group Share Best Practice<br>
 <i>Ann Townend , Corus plc. Scunthorpe</i></b></p>
<p>Corus is an international metals company which provides steel and
aluminium products to customers worldwide. Ann gave a revealing
account of what happened when analysts from the four Corus sites
(Scunthorpe, Teesside, Stocksbridge and IJmuiden in the
Nederlands) were gathered to pool their knowledge in an exchange
of best practices. The XRF analytical group found that completely
different techniques had been adopted in site laboratories;
sometimes fusion techniques were being used and sometimes pressed
pellets for the same analysis. Even when the same techniques had
been used, the conditions used were different. To complicate
matters, all were using different sample preparation equipment
and different XRF instrumentation.</p>
<p>Two years on now, consistency of methods is being achieved.
The same fusion equipment is now used at all four sites. Round
Robin exercises in the analysis of test samples are showing
convergence of the results obtained for the different sites.
There have been some spin-offs: for instance, by adopting one
site's method, using 8g rather than 10g of flux as used at other
sites, &pound;3200 per annum is potentially saved by the company.
However, the main gain has been in the exchange of ideas between
the analysts of the company's laboratories. Future co-operative
plans include joint development of wide range calibrations and
the pooling of resources in producing calibration standards.</p>

Ken summarised some of the major coatings activity in the National 
High Temperature and Surface Engineering Centre at Cranfield University. 

He demonstrated the value of XRF in analysing and monitoring the application 
of surface coatings, using spectra obtained from a Bruker S2 Ranger 
multisample XRFS system. He illustrated his talk with applications relating 
to coatings used on aerospace gas turbine components. Such coatings are 
applied to give either heat, oxidation or abrasion resistance using specialist 
processes such as electron beam physical vapour deposition, plasma spraying, 
metal sputtering and multilayer deposition. They included, amongst others, 
zirconia-based ceramics used for thermal barrier coatings, superalloys and 
bond coats. Particular emphasis was placed on the analysis of trace elements 
in the materials, the concentrations of rare earth oxide dopants and their 
importance in thermal barrier coating technology.<br clear="left"></p>

<p><b>Silver Determination in Photographic Emulsion by EDXRF<br>

<p>David described his frustrating quest to provide a simple XRF
determination of silver in photographic emulsions (suspensions of
silver chloride, bromide and iodide in gelatin solutions) as an
alternative to the traditional determination -titration with
thioacetamide - a relatively toxic reagent.<br>
<br>
Since the emulsions tend slowly to settle out, direct
determination in a liquid cell was not an option. <img align=
"left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Presentation Slide DB (15K)" src=
"../Meetings/06slide/DB.gif" border="2" height="384" width="512">
So he attempted to obtain a clear solution by dissolution of the
silver halides. His first thought was to start with a reagent
similar to photographic fixers, solutions of ammonium
thiosulphate and acetic acid. He added strontium nitrate as an
inert heavy absorber, to nullify changes in X-ray ray absorption
coefficient of the sample solution due to the variable
composition of the emulsions and to decrease critical depth to
less than that of the liquid cells. Unfortunately, this resulted
in a cloudy suspension solution. He believes this must have been
due to the formation of strontium sulphite by reaction with
sulphite impurities in the ammonium thiosulphate supply. When he
substituted sodium thiosulphate, which could be obtained in a
purer form, the required clear solution was obtained. Now, he
became concerned that the combination of the strontium nitrate
with thiosulphate could potentially prove explosive if it dried
out. So he substituted strontium acetate for the nitrate. As
final flourish he added a little acetic acid to the solution to
the "strontium fix" to lower the pH and to assist in the
dissolution of the gelatin of the emulsions.</p>
<p>He now had an XRF method, which he was able to demonstrate
gives, the same result (&plusmn;1%) as the titration method as
shown in the slide above. However, his company has yet to approve
a change.<br clear="left"></p>

Sharon explained that as a prelude to carrying out a project
into the feasibility of provenancing ancient glassware finds on
the basis of their XRF analysis of trace elements, she wanted to
establish the best XRF analytical methods using less precious
artifacts i.e. wine bottles from the local bottle bank. The
technique she used was to finely grind the glass before analysing
it as a powder. Using a PANalytical Axios WDXRF spectrometer with
Protrace software, she was able to determine 44 elements from Cl
to U of concentrations down to 2 ppm. Using Principal Component
Analysis - a statistical three dimensional breakdown
of patterns of elemental concentration - she 
attempted to identify clusters of data corresponding to different
provenances for the glass bottle. She was able to show that it
was possible to distinguish between green glass of bottles of
European and South American or an Australian origin. However, it was not
possible to distinguish a similar pattern of clusters
corresponding to different origins for wine bottles made of clear
glass. Nevertheless, having proved the potential value of the
technique, she now proposes to advance her project attempting to establish the
provenance of glass artifacts of Islamic age found in Bahrain and Syria.

<p><b>A different use for ED-XRF within the Pharmaceutical
Industry"<br>
 <i>Andy Smith, GlaxoSmithKline R&amp;D. (Stevenage)</i></b>
<i>and Martin Teasdale, GlaxoSmithKline
R&amp;D.(Tonbridge)</i></p>
<p>
<img align=
"left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Presentation Slide AS (15K)" src=
"../Meetings/06slide/AS.gif" border="2" height="384" width="512">
Andy described his attempts to use XRF as a rapid technique to
confirm the identity of inorganic compounds used as starting
materials in manufacture of pharmaceuticals in pilot plants.
Identification of such "General Use Materials" (GUMs) is required
by "Good Manufacturing Practice" (GMP) procedures even on small
scale production of clinical grade "Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredients" (APIs). These inorganic compounds are currently
identified using relatively complicated and time-consuming tests
involving techniques such as titration and ion
chromatography.</p>
<p>He used a PANalytical Minipal4 EDXRF spectrometer. This instrument is simple, 
low cost and small enough to fit on a standard laboratory bench top. 
The XRF technique - basically loose
filling liquid cells with the powders - is simple and quick. In
many cases, a simple matching of XRF spectra with library spectra
could be used. However, to distinguish some anion salts of
metals, it was necessary to take into account the relative ratios
of elemental peaks and Rayleigh and Compton scattering peaks.
Using principal component analysis, compounds as similar as sodium carbonate and
sodium bicarbonate could then be distinguished.</p>
<p>The work is very promising. GSK propose working with
PANalytical towards putting together a suitable software package
for general use in the pharmaceutical industry. This method
should be suitable for relatively inexperienced operators with
very little need to interpret the spectra.<br clear="left"></p>

<p><b>"XRF in the glass industry"<br>
 <i>Daniel Capon</i></b> <i>and M Marshall, Glass Technology
Services 9 Churchill Way, Chapeltown, Sheffield S35 2PY.</i></p>
<p>Daniel gave a rapid overview of the tricks used by the glass
industry to obtain the required colours of glasses. These were
interesting, not especially for an account of the metals which
produce the different colours, cobalt -blue etc, but for the
different additives which could be used to make the glass appear
colourless. These included oxidising agents, added to change the
valency state of ferrous iron - the main contaminant giving glass
a green colouration - to the ferric state, giving it a less
noticeable yellowish tint. Another trick is to introduce a metal salt
giving a complementary colour to that due to the contaminants, so
cancelling it out, though this tended to produce glass with a
greyish tint. With greater use of recycled glass these techniques
were coming more into play and depended heavily on the rapid
analysis of the glass melts to determine corrective actions. XRF
was an ideal technique for this purpose. Andy said that GTS was
developing methods for analysing the majority of trace colouring elements 
commonly found in glass in order to help customers solve
problems. Allied with this is the development of specialist drift correction 
glasses containing detectable quantities of multiple elements, for use with 
XRF spectrometers</p>
<p><strong>Margaret West</strong> closed the meeting by thanking all the speakers for 
the work that went into their presentations. She also thanked the staff at the venue 
for helping to make the meeting a success and an excellent lunch. She closed the 
meeting by thanking the delegates for sparing valuable time to attend 
and gave a reminder of the next meeting in Canterbury in April 2007.</p>
