<h5>Introduction.</h5>
<p>The 23rd Annual BCA Spring Meeting was held at the University of Loughborough 
from the 11th to the 14 April 2005. Delegates were drawn mainly from UK 
Universities, commercial and industrial institutions. As in previous meetings, 
the programme was packed with plenary lectures, workshops and themed, parallel, 
sessions organised by the Industrial Group, Chemical Crystallography Group, 
Biological Structures Group and the Physical Crystallography Group. For the 
first time at a BCA meeting, sessions were also provided for the XRF community 
- organised by the Industrial Group. The breadth and depth of the meeting 
was such that everyone had to be selective in the choice of presentations etc 
that they attended. Reports on the IG XRD content are reported elsewhere. </p>
<p>The Sessions started with an introduction to XRF by <strong>Dave Taylor</strong> aimed at 
crystallographers and new users who were unfamiliar with the capabilities of the
technique. This was followed by a talk from <strong>Phil Russell</strong> of PANalytical who
covered the factors influencing the choice of either an EDXRF or WDXRF instrument for a particular job.
</p>

<h5>1. Exhibitors Forum.</h5>
<p>All exhibitors at the meeting were given the opportunity to give a 10 minute 
commercial presentation on their products in this session. Dave Taylor and David Beveridge
made sure that everyone kept to time. The session was well received and gave delegates 
an insight into the products available and a chance to get to know the company representatives.
It did make prioritising time spent that evening touring the exhibition much easier and 
 exhibitors were pleased with the opportunity given to interface directly with delegates. </p>

<h5>2. Liquid Samples.</h5>
<p><strong>Overcoming cobalt interference in Sulphur
Analysis.</strong><br>
Sian Shore, Shell Global Solutions.</p>
<p>Sian reported on the problem of a 3rd order cobalt
interference on the determination of Sulphur in liquid samples
using 2.5 micron Mylar supports. The samples are a mixture of
alkanes, alcohols and paraffin with approx 0.4% Co and 8ppm S.
Daily analyses taking 3 hours are carried out for K, S, P and Co
using a variety of techniques. This work aimed to move the
analysis onto a PW2400 WDXRF instrument and overcome a previous
empirical correction for the Co interference on S. Careful
setting of the pulse height (a lower level of 32 and upper level of 61 on a nominal scale of 
0 - 100 with the analysed peak centred at 50) was found to overcome the
problem and remove the need for further correction. Transfer of
the analysis to WDXRF was successful and reduced the 3 hour
timescale to just 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Ppb analysis of river water by XRF.</strong><br>
Al Martin, Rigaku USA</p>
<p>Two methods of analysis of non-volatile elements in liquid samples are 
common: as a liquid in a cell with a He or air path; or evaporated onto a 
support with a vacuum path. Al described the use of the "Ultra Carry" 
filter (absorption pad) with the advantage over conventional filter papers 
of greater absorbance and lower backgrounds, consequently producing lower 
limits of detection. This study of river water samples concentrated 50 mL 
down to 500 uL using a rotary evaporator. The concentrate was sequentially 
pipetted and dried onto the Ultra Carry filter. The special support design 
prevents sample from creeping beyond the center pad. Calibrations gave 
standard deviations of 17ppb Cr, 14ppb As, 27ppb Se, 29ppb Cd and 24ppb Pb 
and demonstrated a simple, highly reproducible method for the analysis of 
ppb trace elements in water samples using a standard WDXRF spectrometer.</p>

<p><strong>Film 2005. A review of thin films used in XRF Analysis
of Liquid Samples.</strong><br>
 Gaetan Deshais, BrukerAXS.</p>
<p>Thin film supports are used for a variety of applications for
both liquid and powder samples in air or Helium paths, especially
for standardless analyses of non-routine samples. Commercial
films include: Mylar, Hostaphan, Prolene, Kapton and
Polycarbonate and all exhibit different properties. The best film
to use for a particular application is chosen by considering its
chemical resistance, x-ray transmission, thickness, purity and
spectral artefacts. Mylar and Prolene were compared using an oil
doped with 100ppm of trace elements and a blank oil for purity
tests. Prolene was better than Mylar for light elements &lt;Si.
For elements with higher atomic number than Cl there was no
intensity advantage in using thinner films. Calcium and
Phosphorous were found as impurities in Mylar. Spectral
impurities (a problem for S and Cl in gasoline by EDXRF) were
worse for Mylar than Prolene. Gaetan summarised by saying that
the analyst must take care in selecting the right film for each
application by considering, transmission, thickness, purity,
chemical resistance and spectral artefacts and thanked Analysco
for supplying the test films.</p>
<p><strong>Using Activated Alumina for Heavy Metal Contaminants
Analysis.</strong><br>
Steve Davies, PANalytical.</p>
<p>Steve described the analysis of liquid hazardous waste (LHW)
sometimes referred to as "Cemfuel". It is a mixture of liquid
combustible contaminated waste materials eg paints, oil,
solvents, some solids and an aqueous phase. It is used as a low
cost fuel for cement works and other high temperature kilns the
trade off being the presence of hazardous elements whose
concentration must be controlled by analysis. An EDXRF Norm
method ASTM D6052-2003 exists for the determination of 28
elements including As, Se, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Bi. However, most
cement works already use WDXRF for process control with enough
idle time to analyse LHW samples if a method was available. Steve
has shown that this is possible by using Analar acidic activated
alumina to set the overall sample matrix and bind sample
residues. 8g of Alumina and 2g of sample are mixed in a PTFE
bottle, transferred to small &lt;30mm diameter liquid cells with
a polypropylene film and carefully tamped down. With appropriate
instrument settings and a total measurement time of 15 minutes
Steve proved that WDXRF was capable of the analysis of LHW
samples with lower limits of detection well below the maximum
permissible limits with good precision.</p>

<h5>3. Awkward Samples Workshop.</h5>
<p>This informal session began with a discussion of liquid and
loose powder samples in cups. Films used in practise included 2.5
micron mylar and 4 - 12 micron polypropylene; rolls being
preferred over pre-cut packs. Organic liquids can creep out of
cups sealed only with narrow rings. Where bubbles form in the
liquid under x-rays, a preliminary ultrasonic blast may help.
Thinner polycarbonate films can be used for loose powders, but
the heat absorbed by metals, particularly copper base, has been
known to melt the film. Systems that decompose under x-rays, e.g.
silver thiosulphate precipitating silver sulphide and copper EDTA
complex depositing copper, can be tackled by using short reading
times and low power; or conventional ways can be reversed and
peaks read before backgrounds and elements read in order of
increasing energy. The absorption of helium by charcoal was
mentioned, for which an air or nitrogen path must be used.</p>
<p>The session considered a couple of intractable problems for
its members, but without noticeable breakthroughs - some problems
we learn to work around! David Beveridge described the
differences he finds between the sensitivity of silver as silver
halide and as metal on a thin film, meaning he cannot use one
calibration. His calculations showed the samples were definitely
thin to the x-rays used, but silver halide always gives 2-3% more
counts for the equivalent concentration of silver. Gordon Plummer
discussed his work on catalyst residues in organic materials,
constrained by the rather small amounts of samples he has to work
with. He finds that the response for palladium, iron and many of
the other metal analytes is quenched by the presence of bromine
and chlorine in his samples, with bromine having more effect.
Palladium is effected most severely and chromium the least.
Gordon was using 6 mm cells to give infinite thickness for his
analysis.</p>
<p>The session finished with a reference to the use of sellotape
to support very small samples (from behind) for semi-quantitative
analysis, despite its problems with contaminants.
Contaminant-free x-ray tape is also available, although 'Jela'
tape is probably not. All the participants agreed that sharing
tips and problems was very valuable, even when no definitive
answer is forthcoming.</p>

<h5>4. WDXRF Applications.</h5>
<p>The afternoon WDXRF session started with Margaret West
delivering a talk entitled <strong>"Keep it Clean!"</strong>
Here, the importance of care and attention by the analyst to
ensure quality of testing was discussed. The need of routine
cleaning procedures for accessories, laboratory areas and
instruments to avoid contamination was emphasised. Margaret also
gave a number of cleaning procedures for XRF accessories and the
laboratory depending upon level of contamination.</p>
<p>David Beveridge followed with a presentation entitled
<strong>"Determination of Sulphur and Chlorine in Organic
Compounds by XRF"</strong>. David developed an XRF method for
samples in solution to replace the oxygen flask combustion method
for sulphur previously used by his organic chemist colleagues.
N-methyl pyrrolidone was chosen as the solvent with 5 mg/ml of
sample in solution. Using a matrix dilution method, variations in
matrix absorption coefficient (mac) between samples must be as
small as possible. Calculation of mac values showed that
absorption and enhancement effects can normally be ignored (less
than 1% differences), but if not the sample dilution, or solvent,
are changed. The specimens in solution are analysed in 25mm cups,
using 12 micron polypropylene film (6 micron for Al and Si). The
calibrations are linear and were demonstrated using Cl and S as
examples.</p>
<p>This was followed by Michel Davidts from Socachim with
<strong>"Fusion for Better Analytical Results in XRF
Analysis".</strong> Michel described the advantages of fusion in
sample preparation to achieve accurate and fast elemental
analysis. He highlighted a wide range of parameters (e.g.
particle size, sample-flux granularity, fusion temperature, flux
types etc.), which need to be considered to optimise fusion of
different samples. Socachim, in collaboration with various
industries have developed standard fusion methods for partially
oxidized materials such as sulphides, metal powders and
ferroalloys that avoid the attack of the platinum vessels
observed using conventional fusion conditions. They observed that
Lithium Nitrate was the best oxidizer for these types of sample
followed by Sodium, Potassium and Strontium Nitrates. They also
found that the addition of wetting additives such as a solution
of LiBr could improve significantly the fusion of these difficult
samples.</p>
<p>The Socachim talk was followed by Dr. Rainer Schramm from
Fluxana with <strong>"Fusion Technology: Basic and
Applications".</strong> Dr Schramm started his talk by describing
the advantages of using automated fused bead technology against
pressed pellet preparation for accurate analysis. In addition, he
presented the different parameters controlling fusion and gave a
number of practical examples to be considered in routine analysis
such as the influence of moulds and casting dishes on analysis
errors. He also provided some practical experience such as the
limitations of LiBr as additive when Aluminium and Magnesium are
the elements of interest.</p>
<p>The following talk, a late replacement in the programme, was
given by Dr Elspeth Garman on <strong>"Elemental analysis of
proteins by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry"</strong>. It
was prefixed with an excellent introduction to protein
crystallography which set the scene for understanding the need
for the identification and quantification of inorganic elements
within proteins. She dealt with the possibility of using a
commercial WDXRF instrument for identification and quantification
of trace metals in protein macromolecules by comparison to work
already carried out using proton excitation with the costly
microPIXE technique. Cytochrome 550 was successfully studied, and
signals obtained from a sample which was calculated to have 2.1 g
of sulphur and 0.6 g of iron in the x-ray beam proved that WDXRF
has a role in the study of proteins.</p>
<p>The final presentation of Wednesday afternoon was from Graham
Oliver with <strong>"Status of WDXRF in Ceramic
Analysis".</strong> Graham summarised a number of current and new
standard methods for WDXRF and described in more detail standards
that are used for light elements (e.g. B, F, C, S, Si, Al etc.).
He concluded his talk by drawing attention to the need for
development of speciation techniques using WDXRF and considered
Cr to be a priority.</p>

<h5>5. Standards &amp; Calibration.</h5>
<p><strong>Setting the Standards for Calibrations.</strong><br>
 Margaret West, West X-ray Solutions Ltd.</p>
<p>Margaret began by asking us to think about whether things had
changed for existing calibrations, especially the validity of
concentration ranges, sample preparation method, newly available
standards etc &ndash; are they still fit for purpose? She then
described Certified Reference Materials (CRM&rsquo;s), their
generation (ISO guidelines), use and a new accreditation service
being developed by UKAS for CRM producers. She explained the
steps in producing a CRM with reference to a new dolomite
standard. The use of standards and problems encountered led into
calibration procedures, interferences, regression analysis and
checks for variability to look into when setting calibrations
up.</p>
<p><strong>An improved analytical methodology using synthetic
standards, fused beads and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for
cements and associated materials</strong><br>
 Neil Eatherington, British Geological Survey</p>
<p>Neil began by saying that cement reference materials can be
obtained from NIST and A.G. derDillinger Huttenwerke. The usually
adopted method is BSEN 196-2 1995 &lsquo; Method of analysis of
cements by XRF Specrtometry&rsquo;. The method is used to
quantify the levels of SiO<sub>2</sub>,
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO and
MgO in cements. The new method uses 9 synthetic cements which
include 13 oxides from pure compounds. XRD is used to confirm the
composition of the synthetic materials. The materials were fused
at 800C (1g of material and 10g of flux) and analysed using the
PANalytical Magix-Pro XRF Spectrometer.</p>
<p><strong>Use of disparate materials for the calibration of an
EDXRF spectrometer for the analysis of waste packaging
material.</strong><br>
Ken Field, Oxford Instruments Analytical</p>
<p>Ken began by saying that countries including USA, European
Union and China have or will have legislation restricting the
levels of toxic elements in waste products e.g. &lsquo;End of
Life vehicle regulations&rsquo;. Lead, cadmium, hexavalent
chromium, mercury and bromine are some of the materials that need
to be monitored and controlled. Ken said that in the absence of
commercially available comprehensive set of calibration
standards, calibrations have been made using &lsquo;available
standards&rsquo;, synthetic standards and &lsquo;well
analysed&rsquo; samples. There are three distinct aspects to the
method 1) determination of optimum measurement conditions for
sensitivity and matrix correction 2) spectra correction for low
atomic number samples of less than infinite depth and 3)
empirical corrections using scatter signals to compensate for
variations in sample thickness, matrix and form. He concluded by
saying that results show that by careful selection of scatter
signals over a wide range of energies, corrections are achievable
for sample composition, depth and form.</p>

<h5>6. EDXRF Applications.</h5>
<p><strong>How does mobile XRF measure up to contaminated land
assessment?</strong><br>
Mark Ingham (for Leaian Grimsley), British Geological Survey.</p>
<p>Mark explained that XRF equipment has traditionally been large
and expensive and not suitable for field work. However, with the
advent of cooled detectors and small XRF tubes, XRF equipment is
now breaking free of the laboratory. Mark described his work in
the sampling and analysis of soil in the Tavistock district of
Devon. The PANalytical MiniPal 2 energy dispersive (ED) XRF
instrument was used to measure As and Zn in soil. Results were
compared with those obtained from a hand-held Niton XLT 700 ED
XRF and a laboratory MAGIX Pro 4kW wavelength dispersive (WD) XRF
instrument. The MiniPal showed good accuracy at the 0.1% level.
Portable XRF' s can analyse up to 40 samples per day whereas the
'hand-held' versions can analyse hundreds of samples per day
(some of these come with GPS so that each analysis and its
location can be accurately recorded).</p>
<p><strong>Field portable XRF for in-situ screening and analysis
of prohibited substances in plastics</strong><br>
Stanislaw Piorek, R&amp;D Niton, LLC</p>
<p>1st July 2006 is the date a new European Directive becomes
Law. It targets the maximum levels of metals such as chromium(6),
mercury and cadmium in new electrical and electronic materials.
Stanislaw went on to say that given the sheer amount of testing
required, as well as the diversity of conditions of testing, it
can easily be concluded that the effectiveness of inspections
depends on the availability of proven, reliable and fast testing
tools and methods.</p>
<p>Stanislaw described the use of a hand-held, Field Portable
(FP) XRF instrument which has been configured for the in-situ
analysis and screening of plastics for regulated elements. XRF is
good for this type of work because it is non-destructive, has
fast sample turnaround, has wide dynamic range, is rugged, easy
to operate and is a mature technique. Although the technique
cannot distinguish between trivalent and hexavalent chromium it
can detect total chromium - so if the level is below the
threshold, there is no need to further test. We were told that
FPXRF can achieve minimum detection limits way below the level of
100 mg/kg for such elements as cadmium, mercury, lead, chromium
and bromine. There are still challenges to overcome: relatively
complex compositions (plastics), diversified morphology (shape,
size and surface finish) and an extremely wide range of
concentrations (0.0005 to 100%).</p>
<p><strong>EDXRF applications in the pharmaceutical
industry</strong>,<br> 
Martin Teasdale, GlaxoSmithKline</p>
<p>Martin began by saying that EDXRF, is now considered a viable
alternative to the existing ICP-AES methods used within GSK.
There is minimal sample preparation and the technique is
generally non-destructive. Larger than normal sample sizes can be
used to minimize issues associated with unrepresentative or
poorly mixed samples. Martin went on to describe the use of EDXRF
for the determination of palladium in drug substance and
intermediates and the determination of iodine in process streams.
XRF has also been found to be a rapid qualitative analysis tool.
Method validation is through comparison with alternative
techniques such as ICP-AES. A background ratio method is used to
take account of differences in sample amounts.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-EDXRF and its Applications - non-destructive
elemental imaging</strong><br>
Dr Adrian Knowles, HORIBA Jobin Yvon Ltd</p>
<p>This talk presented an overview on the micro-EDXRF technique
and its wide and varied applications. It began by briefly
comparing different methods of generating the x-ray micro-beam,
and looked at the benefits and drawbacks of these. In particular
the mono-capillary x-ray optic was shown to combine excellent
spatial resolution with high intensity, factors responsible for
micro-EDXRF now becoming a routine analytical tool. Recent
technological developments were then discussed, showing how
non-destructive EDXRF analysis is now possible with a spatial
resolution of 10 microns, and at atmospheric pressure. The
applications for micro-EDXRF are varied, and a number of specific
examples were discussed, illustrating the power of the technique
for quickly providing spectra of microscopic features and
detailed images showing elemental distribution over a sample.
These included case studies from recent electronic, geological,
forensic, biological, archaeological and pharmaceutical
research.</p>

<h5>7. Combined XRF/XRD.</h5>
<p><strong>Combining XRF, powder XRD and structural modelling
techniques: application to plastic clays and kaolins</strong><br>
Noel Thomas, WBB Minerals, Germany</p>
<p>Noel began by saying that XRF has high accuracy and precision
but it does not provide phase information. In contrast, phase
information can be obtained from XRD but peak heights cannot
reliably be used as an indicator of concentration. By combining
the strengths of both techniques, valuable insight can be gained
into the mineralogy of clays. The method of combination employs a
structural modelling technique, whereby atomistic models of clay
minerals, quartz and feldspars are constructed from (Si,
Al)O<sub>4</sub><sup>m-</sup> and (Al, Fe,
Mg)O<sub>6</sub><sup>n-</sup> octahedral building blocks. Noel
explained that in the illite-smecite system, aluminium can 'flip'
from octahedral to tectrahedral sites. Minerals of interest are
quartz and feldspars. The method can handle feldspars and micas
'together' and by combining with XRD can get and independent
determination of quartz.</p>
<p><strong>XRD and XRF studies on GaMnAs thin films</strong><br>
Chris Staddon, University of Nottingham</p>
<p>Chris began with an introduction to Spintronic materials -
dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors with manganese contents in
the range 0.5 to 9%. They utilize the magnetic states of
electrons. One of the key questions concerns the chemical content
of the films, which is often not well established. They have
grown a series of 1 micron and 50 nanometer GaMnAs films by
Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) with a nominal composition of 8, 5
and 2% Mn. Good quality films were produced. Accurate
determination of the film thickness and lattice parameter were
obtained by simulation of the 004 diffraction pattern using
PANalytical' Epitaxy 4.0 software. The manganese concentrations
were measured by XRF and other popular techniques. The results
show that the Mn concentrations measured by different methods are
different and that the differences between them become smaller
with increasing Mn content. Thus, Mn concentration cannot be
measured by XRD alone. XRF can give concentration but it requires
an accurate thickness measurement as provided by XRD.</p>
