<h3>Morning Session</h3>
<p><strong>Welcome<br>
<i>Dave Taylor, BCA Industrial Group</i></strong></p>

<p>Dave provided the welcome for the day from the Industrial Group of the BCA 
for this second joint XRF meeting with the RSC Atomic Spectroscopy Group.  
He thanked all the sponsors for their kind contributions, the BGS for use of 
the excellent facilities and Mark Ingham and his collegues for their help with 
set up and local arrangements.

<p>The first talk of the morning was by <b>Nick Marsh (Leicester University)</b>, 
on the preparation and presentation of mineral samples for XRF analysis. The 
usual requirement is a fine powder (but if you have to crush the sample, is the 
technique nondestructive?) and there are several stages to this. Drying should 
be undertaken with care: volatile elements such as mercury can be lost, as can 
essential water from hydrated minerals. Crushing and milling is very dependent 
on mineral properties such as hardness, brittleness, cleavage and density, all 
but the last of which can be anisotropic. The final stage is to convert the 
powder into a form suitable for analysis. This may be a loose powder, a pressed 
pellet, a fused bead, even a dust on a filter. These all have their particular 
characteristics. It is always worth thinking about critical thickness (or 
thinness, in the case of dust on a filter). Mineralogical effects - for example, 
when one grain type is very different in its absorption of X-rays to others - can 
be very significant in pressed pellet samples. A fused bead will get round this 
difficulty. All in all, it was an interesting and thought-provoking talk.
</p>
<p>The second speaker of the session was <b>John Mansell (Omya UK Ltd)</b>, 
who spoke about the analysis of limestones by EDXRF. This study included elements 
from major to trace levels, and included samples from a large number of quarries, 
so that the provenance of unknown samples could be established. The XRF method 
was very much quicker than previous methods (ICP or DCP-based) which required 
preliminary dissolution of the sample. Not quite all elements could be analysed 
- in particular, the sensitivity needed for Cd is really beyond the instrument, 
and Ba is difficult because of line overlaps.
</p>
<p><b>Margaret West (West Analytical Solutions Ltd) </b>spoke next, describing 
the background to a new BSI standard for glass-making sands. She described the 
parameters of the specification for a glass-making sand, and how the new version 
of BS2975 had been put together by the Society for Glass Technology. This is in 
two parts: sampling and testing; and chemical analysis. A wide range of physical 
properties is specified, which need to be tested. There is a detailed description 
of a sampling protocol, because sampling (surprise, surprise!) is one of the 
trickiest problems in the analysis. Grinding media are discussed, and the 
preparation of samples for presentation to the XRF. For some purposes, wet 
chemical analysis (inevitably involving HF digestions) is unavoidable, but 
mostly XRF is a lot easier. Standards and reference materials are, of course, 
needed, and a range has been made available by the Society for Glass Technology 
in conjunction with BAS Ltd.
</p>
<p>The final talk in the morning session was by <b>John Boyle (University of 
Liverpool)</b>, who described the analysis of lake sediment cores by EDXRF. 
These samples can be very variable, and a general approach is needed. Many 
elements must be determined, often in a small sample (less than 1 g - the cores 
may have to be divided among many researchers). Particle size is rarely a problem 
because it is normally very small anyway. Matrix effects are definitely a problem, 
but one for which corrections can usually be made. Background measurements can be 
awkward, as the peaks are close together, but there are ways around this difficulty. 
Line overlaps are another problem, but again one which can be overcome with care.
</p>
<p>This closed the morning session, after which we enjoyed an excellent buffet 
lunch while we looked at the manufacturers' exhibits.

<h3>Afternoon Sessions</h3>
<p><strong>Chair, Afternoon Session 1<br>
<i>Ros Schwarz.(Oxford Instruments Analytical)</i></strong></p>

<p>
<b>Neil Eatherington, <i>(British Geological Survey, Nottingham)</i>	<br>
When Sample preparation is not an option.</b></p>

<p>Neil acknowledged that for the majority of applications XRFS requires sample 
preparation to get the best from the technique, but what happens when preparation 
is not an option?  In-situ samples together with historic or valuable samples 
require sensitive handling and cannot be destroyed.  The problems with in-situ 
analysis stem from the moisture content of samples together with particle size 
and mineralogical effects.
</p>
<p>Drying of samples was discussed with attention drawn to the problems of using 
a microwave oven (elevated temperatures of up to 200°C) and the loss of volatile 
analytes from environmental and soil samples.  Conventional drying at 40°C was 
ruled out because of the time taken to achieve a dry sample (&lt;5% moisture) measured in days rather than minutes.
</p>
<p>Several case studies were presented featuring marine sediment cores, panned 
stream concentrates and in-situ analysis.  Data was compared between handheld 
XRFS costing ~ £35k and specialist equipment such as an ITRAX core scanner costing 
~£200k with the conclusion that the handheld was useful as a screening tool and 
has some success at quantification.  Overall the correlations between fully 
prepared samples and in-situ samples were generally good.
</p>
<p><b>Prof Graham Martin, <i>(Victoria and Albert Museum, London)</i><br>
Heritage and XRFS -unlikely companions?</b>
</p>

<p>This was a different presentation where Graham avoided posting the usual 
spectra, graphs and data but instead concentrated on the application of ED-XRF 
within the heritage sector.  Graham began with an overview of the Victoria and 
Albert Museum and its associated institutes and explained that a large challenge 
was communicating the applications to his colleagues with arts based backgrounds.
</p>
<p>The sheer scale and diversity of the exhibits and potential sampling sites 
were discussed together with the fact that invasive and chemical techniques were 
offered as a last resort but usually not at all.  The analytical equipment used 
was presented from the Tracor DuBois pigment analyser from 1983 to the present 
equipment of the Bruker ArtTax, a portable (in 3 cases), open-sourced analyser 
mounted on a highly flexible mechanical arm that requires high operator skill levels.
</p>
<p>The types of sampling were explored detailing pigments from an unused artist 
palette from 1880 that effectively provided standards for pigments through to 
illuminated manuscripts, ceramics and more recently the exploration of polymers 
in more contempory exhibits.
</p>
<p>Health and safety aspects were also considered by demonstrating the elevated 
arsenic contamination from the process of taxidermy to the contamination of 
mercury in felt hats.  Indeed it was suggested that if one hat was thrown into 
a reservoir it had the potential to poison one million litres of water at present 
WHO levels of mercury contamination.
</p>
<p><b>Owen Butler,<i> (HSL, Buxton) </i>&amp; Elke Adriaenssens, <i>(VMM, Antwerp, Belgium)</i><br>
Analysis of heavy metals in suspended airborne particles collected on filter papers by XRF techniques.</b> </p>

<p>Owen  began  by  summarising  the work of the HSL at the Buxton site which  
has  favourable scientific and engineering facilities.  As an agency  of  the 
Health and Safety Executive, part of the governments Department  of  Work  and  
Pensions  the  analytical  services  unit undertakes  wide  ranging  tests and 
is involved with regulatory and investigative  measurements, method development, 
proficiency testing and some commercial work.
</p>
<p>The  workplace  risk  to  the inhalation of aerosol and particulates down  
to  sub-micron  size  and  subsequent  sampling  problems were discussed.   
In particular was noted the problem caused by ergonomic work   practices   
of   sampling  to  mimic  inhalation.   Technical innovations such as a 
unique design of filter cups to accept varying diameter  papers from 13-48 mm, 
together with the problems of moving from  WD-XRFS to ED-XRFS analysis and the 
subsequent bias introduced with the smaller beam size were presented.
</p>
<p>A  new  model for sampling particles, the Minisampler employing a 13 mm  
filter  located  adjacent  to  the  mouth  was  demonstrated and validated 
using a model and automated welding rig. 
</p>
<p>Future  interest  lies  in  the analysis of nano-particles with spot sizes 
down to that of a pinhead.
</p>
<p>Elke introduced her work with VMM, the Belgium equivalent of the EA, 
reporting on air and water quality and the general state of the environment.  
Air quality was measured in a network of automatic and semiautomatic stations 
for a variety of parameters including PM10 and PM2.5 particulate fractions.  
The automatic stations provide continuous real-time data available on the 
website <a class = "news" href = "http://www.vmm.be/">www.vmm.be</a> .
</p>
<p>Two populations of heavy metal data for 2007 were described, urban/rural and 
industrial.  The rural/urban mean and maximum values were low whilst the 
industrial values were high requiring a wide ranging application to process 
more than 7500 samples annually.  Technical problems were overcome by the 
attention to measuring conditions and the lack of commercially available 
standards overcome by a method of in-house standard preparation.  The calibration 
was described as secondary and validated by ICP-MS or AAS techniques.
</p>
<p>Elke went on to describe the equipment used for heavy metal determinations 
commenting on the inflexibility of using two X-ray tubes for the WD-XRFS technique.  
A change of equipment to a PANalytical Epsilon 5 ED-(P)-XRFS with a Gd tube 
allowed for the analysis of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn at 30 minutes 
per sample.  The advantage of the ED analysis was a lower detection level, 
meeting BS EN 14902 requirements except for Cd. Validation between ED-(P)-XRFS 
and ICP-MS showed good correlation for As, Cd, Ni and Pb at higher concentrations. 
For Ni and Pb the correlation is still acceptable at lower concentrations, for 
Cd and As the correlation is not good in the low concentration range.

<p><b>Richard Meeres, <i>(Bureau of Analysed Samples Ltd)</i>.<br>
A History of the Development of Certified Reference Materials.</b></p>


<p>This presentation discussed the history of the company, from its inception 
in 1912 as Ridsdale &amp; Co to the Bureau of Analysed Samples (BAS) in 1935.  In 
1950, the Honorary Advisory Committee (HAC) was created to provide an unbiased 
wealth of experience, make recommendations, evaluate results and approve 
Certified Reference Materials (CRMs).  The HAC has met twice a year since its 
creation, and BAS also organises Triennial Meetings of UK Co-operating Analysts 
to gather comments and ideas for the future.
</p>
<p>The types of CRMs produced consist of iron &amp; steels, non-ferrous metals 
&amp; alloys, iron &amp; non-ferrous ores, ferro-alloys, slags &amp; refractories 
and ceramic materials &amp; minerals.
</p>

<p><b>Alison Burke, <i>(Huntsman Pigments)</i>.<br>
Routine Analysis of TiO<sub>2</sub> by WD XRF.</b></p>

<p>Huntsman  Pigments  has  seven  factories  around  the world which together
produce  approximately half a million tonnes of titanium dioxide each year.
Around  60%  is used in coatings (paint, etc) with the remainder being used
in products such as plastics, inks, toothpaste and cosmetics.  Sample types
requiring  analysis  are  the  final  packed  pigment,  calciner discharge,
in-process  samples  and  ores.   Several techniques are used for elemental
determination; however XRF provides a simple, rapid and easy to use method.
</p>
<p>The  Harmonisation  Project  of  Analysis was initiated in 1998 in order to
ensure  inter-site  reproducibility precision targets for each XRF element.
Initially  blind  testing  was  carried  out  every six months to establish
levels of agreement using z-score statistics. Now established harmonisation
is  maintained  by  the  project  sharing  monthly validation for all seven
laboratories,  carrying  out annual blind tests, hosting telecons every two
months, providing operator training and international compliance audits.</p>

<p><b>Andy Scothern,<i> (Saint-Gobain Gypsum).</i><br>
XRF Analysis in the Gypsum Industry.</b>
</p>
<p>Gypsum markets consist largely of construction (37%), renovation (29%), 
household (19%) and industry (15%).  Saint-Gobain Gypsum (SGG) currently 
employs in excess of 200,000 people, with two out of three working outside France.  
Research and Development centres are based mainly in France, but also in Germany, 
the United States and South America.  The Technical Centre is based in East 
Leake and concentrates on process research, product research and product development.</p>

<p>Gypsum consists of several phases - gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), hemi-hydrate (
CaSO<sub>4</sub>.1/2 H<sub>2</sub>O), and both soluble and insoluble forms of anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).  
By applying temperature to this material, it phases through gypsum to hemi-hydrate 
to soluble anhydrite finally to insoluble anhydrite and back again by the addition 
of water.  The reduction of water, and therefore the reduction in heat required 
for the final products are crucial and SGG is trying to find ways to implement 
this.</p>

<p>Samples are dried overnight at 40&deg;C in order to remove any free water and to 
convert any soluble anhydrite to hemi-hydrate.  Proximate analysis was used in 
the past to record the weight loss on heating; however, thermogravimetric (TGA) 
monitoring is now used.  Problems with this technique include the inability to 
measure insoluble anhydrite, as there is no water left to lose, and difficulties 
when clays or additives are present.  WD-XRF is now used for total SO<sub>3</sub> content 
in anhydrite as it is more accurate than TGA, assuming all SO<sub>3</sub> is present as 
sulphate.
</p>
<p>Other work in progress included analysis of cement boards, semi-quantitative 
analysis on powders and liquids and trace metals in dusts.
