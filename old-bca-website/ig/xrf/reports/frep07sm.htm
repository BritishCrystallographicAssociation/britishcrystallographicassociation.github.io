<h5>Introduction.</h5>
<p>The 25th Annual BCA Spring Meeting was held at the University
of Kent, Canterbury from the 17th to the 19 April 2007. Delegates
were drawn mainly from UK Universities, commercial and industrial
institutions. As in previous meetings, the programme was packed
with plenary lectures, workshops and themed, parallel, sessions
organised by the Industrial Group, Chemical Crystallography
Group, Biological Structures Group and the Physical
Crystallography Group. For the second time at a BCA spring
meeting, sessions were also provided for the XRF community -
organised by the Industrial Group. The breadth and depth of the
meeting was such that everyone had to be selective in the choice
of presentations etc that they attended. Reports on the IG XRD
content are reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Sessions were officially opened by Dave Taylor prior to
the morning workshop.</p>
<h5>1. Exhibitors Forum.</h5>
<p>All exhibitors at the meeting were given the opportunity to
give a 10 minute commercial presentation on their products in
this session. Dave Taylor made sure that everyone kept to time.
The session was well received and gave delegates an insight into
the products available and a chance to get to know the company
representatives. It did make prioritising time spent that evening
touring the exhibition much easier and exhibitors were pleased
with the opportunity given to interface directly with
delegates.</p>

<h5>2. Workshop - XRF: where are we now?.</h5>
<p align = "center"><img alt="Speaker photograph (33K)" src=
"../images/photos/SM07/2-07.jpg" width="500"><br>
<small><b>Speakers</b> - Left to Right: Bruno Vrebos, Margaret
West, Mark Ingham(Chair), Mike Dobby.</small></p>
<p><strong>Bruno Vrebos</strong> from PANalytical began with XRF:
what instruments have we got or are likely to get soon? An
organogram of X-ray fluorescence showed the multitude of
techniques available within this area of analysis. The two main
stems of this were wavelength dispersive (WDS) and energy
dispersive (EDS). Bruno highlighted the main differences between
the two methodologies these being principles of operation, photon
efficiency and resolution. He then focused down in more detail on
those that would have the greatest impact on a measurement. For
WDS the resolution is primarily determined by a combination of
the crystal and collimator chosen whilst the detector itself will
have little impact. The dispersion is inversely proportional to
the d-spacing of the crystal chosen. This was illustrated by the
Cu K&beta; peak appearing on the shoulder of the Zn K&alpha; peak
with a PET crystal whilst clearly separated when a LIF220 crystal
is used. With EDS there are no analysing crystals or collimators.
Conversely, with EDS the detector makes a major contribution.
With EDS the photon efficiency is far superior to WDS. A lot of
effort is put in to getting photons at the detector in WDS
systems. This is then mitigated by such factors as photo-electric
absorption, fluorescent yield, collimator losses, reflectivity,
window losses to name but a few. For light elements one of the
biggest problems is absorption of their energy specific X-rays by
the sample matrix itself.</p>
<p>Bruno then moved on to consider the use of XRF analysis for
trace elements. Geological samples, one of the areas this
technique can greatly help, have a complex matrix with many
analytes at low concentrations further complicated by often
sloping backgrounds and multiple line overlaps. The focus of this
section of the presentation was the lower limit of detection
(LLD) and how this has and possibly can in the future be reduced.
Tricks of the trade to be considered are reducing the background
by optimising tube voltage and current along with appropriate use
of beam filters. The use of an Al 0.75mm beam filter has the
potential to reduce the counting time from 195 seconds down to
132 seconds to achieve a LLD of 1ppm for As K&szlig;.
Alternatively, the LLD is reduced from 1.4ppm down to 1.1ppm with
a 100 second fixed counting time. The main principles to
improving the LLD are to reduce the background, enhance the
sensitivity and to increase the counting time. I had my first
lesson in 3D optics and what a powerful technique it appears to
be. There is a dramatic reduction in the background as the 3D
optics are set up in such a way that the background is
&ldquo;polarized&rdquo; out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately time beat Bruno and it was easy to understand
why that had happened. Bruno has a relaxed style of presentation
which enabled those of us who are less knowledgeable in the
field, myself included, to easily follow and digest the
information that was being shared with us.</p>
<p>Next we were in the capable hands of <strong>Margaret
West</strong> who presented XRF: what can we do with them?
Margaret lead a workshop style talk on what can XRF do these
days? So how do you find out what can be done with XRF? Apart
from conferences, such as the one we were all attending, with
plenty of experts with knowledge to be shared there are also user
groups in this category. There is also a plethora of literature
in the form of journals, standards, books and reference
materials. In particular the literature based resources Margaret
pointed us to were:</p>
<ul>
<li>IngentaConnect which is an internet search engine with more
then 21 million article, chapters and reports!</li>
<li>X-ray spectrometry Journal. Margaret suggested subscribing to
this at a personal rate of &pound;80 per year c.f. &pound;1000 as
a company subscription.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">JAAS (Journal of Analytical
Spectroscopy) www.rsc.org/jaas.</li>
<li>Atomic spectroscopy updates www.asureviews.org. This is
written by a community of established workers in their field.
Topics includes environmental analysis (all techniques), atomic
emission and annually in October XRF special focus. This reviews
developments in XRF from published work. Recently there has seen
an increase in publications around archaeological science and
cultural heritage. There is a new UKAS scheme for the
accreditation for the preparation of certified reference
materials. Other areas these relevant publications cover include
instrumentation, portable systems, spectrum analysis, X-ray
optics, synchrotron radiation, geological and industrial
applications. The total list is exhaustive. The timetable for the
review is a cut-off in mid-April. Abstracts are then downloaded
and circulated to the writing team. The current members are Andy
Ellis, Peter Kregsamer, Phil Potts, Christina Streli, Christine
Vanhoof, Margaret West and Peter Wobrauschek. There is then a
group meeting in June and a referee meeting in July all to
coincide with the October review.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a non-academic XRF user it can sometimes be difficult to
know where to turn to get help in the literature. Following this
workshop I will not have such a problem in the future. It has
provided me with a wealth of reference information that I&rsquo;m
sure I will be referring to over the coming years.</p>

<p>The final presentation of the morning session was delivered by <strong>Mike Dobby</strong> 
from Bruker AXS on XRF outside of the box. Mike firstly considered laboratory 
based XRF instrumentation that are great if the samples are of the right size, 
will not &ldquo;harm&rdquo; the XRF and the desired level of detection can be achieved. 
So when the above isn&lsquo;t possible how do you take the XRF to the sample? 
There were three approaches that Mike outlined and gave examples for &ndash; online 
XRF, Total Reflection XRF (TXRF) and hand-held XRF.
</p>
 

<p>I&lsquo;d not heard of TXRF before. Apparently it is a form of EDXRF method with 
geometric conditions for both the excitation of the sample and the detection 
of the fluorescence radiation that minimize scatter effects. Mike discussed the 
use of the portable bench-top S2 Picofox in the analysis of wine. K, Ca, Fe 
and Cu for quality control purposes along with multi element analysis for 
origin control. On two wine CRMs purchased from the Centre Oenologique de 
Bourgogne good agreement with the certified values was achieved using the TXRF.  
As Mike pointed out the remainder of the CRM could then be sampled by the 
analyst &ndash; I&lsquo;ll volunteer!
</p>
 

<p>The final part of the presentation was on the Star Trek-esque hand-held 
Tracer III-V XRF. Mike covered a range of unusual samples that this XRF had 
been used to analyse. These included several swords, a Wootz ingot, pistol, 
bronze canon and Zn plated armour from India purported to be the oldest in the 
world. The spectrum obtained by the hand-held XRF clearly showed the presence 
of Zn as well as Cu and As. This was overlaid against a spectrum from a modern 
Fe based standard which highlighted the differences in elements detected. I was 
starting to get concerned about the &ldquo;arms&rdquo; theme but Mike covered elemental 
analysis of other samples ranging from the handle of a mirror, a wooden block, 
Victorian Fox fur, alleged gold leave on a book, finishing with a picture in a 
museum.
</p>
 

<p>Next time I&lsquo;m given an unusual shaped object to analyse my first thought 
may no longer be how can I chop it up to get it in to my lab based XRF but what 
portable instrumentation is there out there that may better suit my needs.
</p>


<p>Thanks are due to both Bruno, Margaret and Mike for a thoroughly
enjoyable and informative session presented by both speakers.</p>

<p><b>What on Earth is this? Semi-quantitative ED-XRF</b><br>
Heather Harrison, British Geological Survey</p>
<p>This talk considered why you would use semi-quantitative
analysis, what you may be looking for from the application and
what sorts of results are obtained.</p>
<p>The system used was a PANalytical Epsilon 5 system which
consisted of two polarised ED-XRFs with 3-D Cartesian optics.
Semi-quantitative analysis has advantages for a wide range of
sample types. These include pressed powder pellets and loose
powders the use of which reduces the time required for sample
preparation.</p>
<p>Examples of analysis were then provided from a wide range of
substrates comparing analysed value to certified value. For both
major and minor component analysis this approach proved to be
only partially successful with some elements being over or
underrepresented depending on the sample matrix. Comparison was
also drawn between loose powder and pressed pellet. The results
proved to be comparable.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use XRF Semi-Quantitative
Analysis</strong><br>
Belen Morales, London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Ltd.</p>
<p>Belen reported on the problem on the problem of carrying out
analysis on materials when no suitable standards are available.
In order to carry out determinations of composition of these
samples she proposed the use of semi-quantitative analysis
protocols in this case Uniquant 4.</p>
<p>This approach has a number of advantages, which include
minimum sample preparation, low detection limits and wide
elemental range. The major features of Uniquant 4 were explained,
namely model based determinations of instrument sensitivities
based on a single sample calibration, extension of fundamental
parameters to solve spectral line overlaps and graphical support
for intensities and calculated backgrounds.</p>
<p>Four case studies were then presented one comparing sample
preparation methods, one looking at different matrixes, a further
study into the analysis of odd samples and finally refining
semi-quantitative analysis. Results proved both consistent and
for the large part accurate.</p>

<p><b>Wide Range Oxide Fused Bead Standards</b><br>
Neil Eatherington, British Geological Survey</p>
<p>This talk discussed methods of calibration using single and
multielement standards prepared as fused beads.</p>
<p>Standards were conditioned at temperatures ranging from
220&deg;C - 1200&deg;C depending on the nature of the material
and then prepared as fused beads by fusing 0.9g of standard with
9g flux at 1200&deg;C for 12 mins. The standards were fused in
duplicate and a blank flux was also prepared. The standards were
then analysed on a PANalytical Axios Advanced using SuperQ
software and FP used as the matrix correction model. The total
measuring time was 9 minutes at 2.4kW. Standards consisted of 20
synthetic materials and 21 oxides.</p>
<p>From the results it would appear that this approach offers
relatively simple preparation, simple calibration and reliable
batch to batch analysis giving accurate results.</p>
<p><strong>No standards? No blank? No standardless analysis
software? No problem!</strong><br>
David Beveridge, Harman technology Ltd - ILFORD Photo</p>
<p>This talk discussed the determination of iron and arsenic
contents in the fluorinated surfactant Lodyne S103A. Suitable lines were
selected and the mass absorption coefficients were determined.
Attempts were then made to match the mass coefficient values in a
number of different matrixes. A number of different organic and
mixed organic inorganic solvent systems were selected. However
after issues over solubility and matrix effects were ascertained
from the predicted response it was determined that a dilute
sulphuric acid solvent system gave the most acceptable results
for this compound.</p>
<p><strong>Normative Committees.</strong><br>
 Phil Russell, PANalytical</p>
<p>This talk discussed what normative committees are, there
relationship to XRF analysis and the importance of
involvement.</p>
<p>These committees are groups that are either trade or
regulatory body related. Tasks of the committee are to promote
standardised methods and/or provide a measurement strategy for
quality or regulatory control. There are a range of norms that
can be developed which include standards that measure a parameter
using a specific technique, guides that provide information about
using a technique or process and protocols for a procedure.</p>
<p>There are ranges of normative committees some of, which are
government lead, some of which are industry lead. They hold
regular meetings about common requirements including specific
industrial processes, health and environment and quality systems.
XRF analysis is a rapidly developing field of analysis and it is
very important that all members of the XRF community play an
active role in these committees to develop XRF analysis as the
procedure of choice.</p>

<h5>6. XRF Applications - including cultural heritage.</h5>

<small><b>Speakers</b> - Left to Right: Jean-Philippe Gagnon

Carvalho,Rene Van Grieken. Claire Collins, Charles Gowing.
Malcolm Haigh (inset).</small></p>
<p>As might be expected from its content, this session produced lots of nice 
pictures of fine buildings and other works of art. We got off to a good start, 
with <strong>Luisa Carvalho</strong> from Lisbon, who spoke on the use of XRF for characterising 
documents. XRF permits the characterisation of different papers and, by use of 
cluster analysis, the grouping of different samples into their types. This work 
is also of use in detecting forgeries. She was followed by <strong>Clair Collins</strong> 
(Oxford Instruments), who described the use of a hand-held XRF analyser for 
examining a range of objects which may broadly be grouped as "cultural heritage". 
Hand-held XRF analysers are becoming popular, with several different types on 
the market, and the sort of things they can do are impressive.</p>

<p><strong>Malcolm Haigh</strong> (Spectro) moved over to more general applications in his talk, 
which centred on the use of a polarised-beam EDXRF unit. This has sundry 
advantages over the more traditional types, in giving more intensity and 
lower backgrounds. This was applied to geological samples. <strong>Charles Gowing </strong>
(British Geological Survey) continued the geological theme, with his talk on a 
compact benchtop EDXRF which can be taken on site in the BGS Mobile Environmental 
Laboratory. They hope to accredit the method under UKAS and for soils under the 
MCERTS scheme. Many geological samples are analysed as fused beads, and 
<strong>Jean-Philippe Gagnon</strong> (Claisse) showed in his talk how to get fast analytical 
results by fusion without knowing the Loss On Ignition. In fact, by using net 
intensities, it is now possible to
calculate the concentration of the volatile compounds lost during the fusion.</p>

<p>The last two talks contained most of the pretty pictures. <strong>Margaret West</strong> 
(West X-Ray Solutions) described some work that had been done for English 
Heritage. Conservation and restoration can be controversial, and much modern 
conservation work involves putting right the mistakes of the past. To take 
one example, the C11th carving at Kilpeck church, in Herefordshire - among the 
best of its era in England - is being attacked by sulphate-rich encrustation. 
Understanding what is happening requires XRF and XRD. In the final talk, 
<strong>René van Grieken</strong> (Antwerp) followed on with the theme from Kilpeck - damage to 
buildings caused by atmospheric aerosols. Examples came from all over Europe 
(not to mention New York) and showed what can happen, not just to stonework, 
but also to stained glass and paintings within a building. A range of techniques, 
not just XRF, were used to analyse the pollutants and their reaction products.

<small><b>Speakers</b> - Left to Right: Margaret West(chair),
Stan Piorek, Ros Schwarz, Nick Marsh, Chris Vanhoof, Rene Van
Grieken.</small></p>

 
<p><strong>Climate records - lurking in the small print? What's
at the bottom of your lake?</strong><br>
<i>Nick Marsh, University of Leicester, Geology</i></p>
<p>Nick started the lecture with a reminder that it was much
warmer during the Jurassic, a time when there was no ice and not
much land and many animals, such as plankton lived fast and died
young thereby preserving the oxygen isotope signature of the
atmosphere at that time. Much research into oxygen isotopes has
benefited from the easy release of oxygen from carbonate phases
by dilute mineral acids followed by analysis by ICP-MS. However,
conditions in naturally acidic lakes do not allow for the
preservation of carbonate fossil remains and processes such as
dolomitisation can change the delta-oxygen ratios.</p>
<p>Fortunately several planktonic and other aquatic creatures
utilise silica to produce their skeletal matter. A series of
fascinating SEM pictures showed the array of skeletal remains
that have been collected from lake sediments as well as some
contaminant materials that can be found in the samples. It is
difficult to remove completely silica contaminants from samples
so XRFS was identified as a reliable technique capable of
determining a wide range of chemical data to enable mass balance
calculations on the various contaminants in the sample. A fused
bead method using very small &lt; 0.1 g sample sizes with 3 g of
high purity flux had been developed for this purpose. An inverse
correlation was observed between &delta;<sup>18</sup>O and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
due to the presence of silt in the samples.</p>
<p><strong>Development and validation results of a new European
Standard prEN 15309 for the determination of the elemental
composition of waste and soil by XRF.</strong><br>
<i>Chris Vanhoof, VITO, Belgium.</i></p>
<p>The growing interest of government and industry to implement
XRFS as an analytical tool for the characterisation of waste and
soil has led to the development and validation of a new European
Standard. This method was working to EU and landfill directives;
the EU directive had previously been based upon aqua regia or HF
digestion methods. Work instructions were developed in 2000-2001
and the Standard went through a series of improvements between
2003 and 2006 and was approved in 2007. This was achieved against
the background of a wide range of matrix compositions and lack of
suitable reference materials for inhomogeneous materials like
waste.</p>
<p>Chris explained that on-site verification of the method would
follow the basic characterisation and control analysis. A range
of methods were considered comparing qualitative or quantitative,
field- or lab-based etc. The Standard incorporates two
procedures, a screening / qualitative phase followed by energy or
wavelength XRF in the laboratory. The method validation was based
upon two soils, one fly ash and ink and an electronic sludge
sample. The characterisation was carried out by an
interlaboratory exercise, participated in by labs from seven
countries. The relative reproducibility of the soils and fly ash
materials was 10-20 % (pellet analysis) or 2-10% (fused bead
analysis) with trace elements &lt; 20 ppm being 8-15% and &lt; 20
ppm 25-30%. The waste material data had a relative
reproducibility up to 50% and the ink sample data had high
standard deviation and a large loss on ignition. All that now
just remains is for the on-site verification to be carried
out.</p>
<p><strong>Screening of electronic products with a "small-spot"
hand-held XRF analyser for compliance with RoHS
Directive.</strong><br>
<i>Stan Piorek, Niton</i></p>
<p>Industry now has to fully comply with EU RoHS, WEEE and ELV
directives. Complying with these directives for testing all
components and raw materials could prove very costly, e.g.
&euro;1300 per sample for a simple component such as a printer
cable. Manufacturers have responded by producing compact
pectrometers with robust calibrations that can perform
non-destructive analysis in a shop floor situation. This
spectrometer utilises a collimated beam to reduce the beam size
to 1 mm2 spot size that can be targeted using an integrated CCD
camera. A number of images illustrated that analysis of
individual solder points is possible and its use for screening
for the presence of brominated flame retardants was also
described. Stan concluded his presentation by coining a new term,
HH-XRF, hand held XRF as distinct from field portable XRF.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-spot XRF in RoHS compliance testing :
performance and pitfalls.</strong><br>
<i>Ros Schwarz, Oxford Instruments.</i></p>
<p>This presentation also covered the analysis of electrical
components to meet EU RoHS directives. Ros described a micro-spot
XRF that could use a video camera to target analysis with spot
sizes of 0.15, 0.3 or 1 mm2 for screening analysis. Difficulties
encountered with analysis of materials such as Sn63Pb37 solder
were discussed and illustrated, particularly spectral line
overlap caused by elements in the matrix substrate. Another
persistent difficulty is the scarcity of Reference Materials
(RMs) and Ros urged caution against using inappropriate RMs if no
suitable ones were available.</p>
