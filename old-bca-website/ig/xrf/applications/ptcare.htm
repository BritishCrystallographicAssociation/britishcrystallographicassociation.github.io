      <P><b>Uses and abuses of 
      platinum ware in the XRF laboratory</b></P>
      <P>The 
      accuracy and precision of data reported by an XRF laboratory reflects care 
      taken by the analyst to ensure that appropriate techniques are adopted to 
      prepare the sample and calibrate the spectrometer. Many laboratories have 
      systems in place to compensate for short and long term drift in the 
      spectrometer with analysts following quality procedures for calibration 
      maintenance. However, the maintenance of sample preparation equipment must 
      not be overlooked and where fusion techniques are adopted, the care of 
      platinum ware is vital. Good analytical practice should minimise cross 
      contamination between samples, but in a busy laboratory fusing a wide 
      range of powdered materials careful handling and cleaning regimes will 
      reduce errors and extend the life-time of the platinum ware.</P>
      <P><B>Platinum ware for 
      XRF analysis</B></P>
  
      <P>Platinum 
      is used for laboratory ware because it is resistant to chemical attack, 
      even at high temperatures and it can be readily fabricated. The addition 
      of 5% gold gives an alloy with improved high temperature strength and non 
      wetting properties. Crucibles and casting dishes vary in shape and size 
      and are selected to satisfy the needs of the fusion process adopted. 
      Techniques may be manual or automated with heat provided by gas burner or 
      electric muffle furnace. </P>
      <P>Samples in 
      the form of oxides, carbonates and silicates may be readily fused with 
      borate fluxes at temperatures up to 1250 ºC with users reporting more than 
      1,000 beads cast from one dish. However, some samples such as 
      ferro-alloys, carbides and spent catalysts from oil refineries represent a 
      greater risk. Samples with incomplete history and &quot; unknowns&quot; presented for 
      semi-quantitative analysis may also challenge the platinum ware and 
      laboratory budget.</P>
      <P>The 
      advantages of presenting a sample for analysis in the form of a fused bead 
      are well documented. However, it is perhaps important to highlight 
      situations that are harmful to the platinum / 5% gold alloy.</P>
     
      <UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0cm" type=disc>
        <LI>Inappropriate handling and accidental physical damage should 
        be avoided.</LI>
        <LI>Platinum ware should only be handled with platinum tipped 
        tongs</LI>
        <LI>Avoid prolonged unnecessary heating; this will limit crystal 
        growth and cracking. </LI>
        <LI>Avoid reducing gas flames</LI>
        <LI>Fusion should be performed under oxidising 
        conditions</LI>
        <LI>Crucibles must not come into contact with SiC heating 
        elements</LI>
        <LI>Regularly remove any particles of SiC that have spalled from 
        the heating elements on to the floor of the furnace.</LI></UL>
      
			<UL>
        <LI>Ensure that metals such as Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn &amp; Pb do not 
        come into direct contact with the platinum ware.</LI>
        <LI>Fine metal powders should be pre-oxidised before fusion using 
        an oxidant such as sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate or strontium 
        nitrate.</LI>
        <LI>Use separate crucibles for samples requiring 
        pre-oxidation</LI>
        <LI>Minimise cross contamination using a thorough cleaning regime 
        for all platinum ware.</LI></UL>
     
      <p><b>Cleaning platinum 
      ware</B></P>
      <P>Routine 
      cleaning of the platinum ware will reduce cross contamination and extend 
      working life. A crucible or casting dish should never be hit or tapped 
      with any implement to remove residual fused sample, stuck to the surface. 
      Any residual material should be removed by one of the following 
      methods:</P>
    
      <OL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0cm" type=1>
        <LI>Soak in 10% solution of citric acid at 50ºC in an ultrasonic 
        bath. This method can be slow for some materials but it is thorough and 
        gentle.</LI>
        <LI>To shorten the cleaning cycle, use 20% w/v citric acid in a 
        beaker at 80ºC</LI>
        <LI>For a more aggressive method use 10% HCl </LI>
        <LI>If all else fails, boil in Cl free HNO<SUB>3</SUB></LI>
        <LI class=MsoNormal 
        style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt"><FONT 
        face=Arial>After acid cleaning, wash thoroughly with clean water and 
        dry</FONT></LI></OL>
     
      <P><font color="#ff0000">WARNING: 
      Never us Aqua Regia.</font></P>
      
      <P>To check 
      for possible cross contamination when developing sample preparation 
      methods, fuse and analyse a blank (100% flux) bead. Crucibles used to 
      prepare samples containing copper compounds are particularly difficult to 
      clean. Fortunately, the presence of a trace of copper will be revealed by 
      a blue discolouration in a blank bead.</P>
      <P><B>Polishing platinum 
      ware.</B></P>
      <P>Spectroscopists using semi-quantitative programmes for the 
      analysis of fused beads will be familiar with the presence of trace levels 
      of both Pt &amp; Au in a reporting list. Gold lost from the surface will 
      reduce the non wetting properties of the ware. The sheen from the surface 
      of new platinum ware will have been replaced by a dull appearance; 
      crucibles and fusion dishes may be deformed and the surface of the casting 
      dish will no longer reflect the analysts face. Scratches and the &quot;orange 
      peal&quot; effect showing the presence of grain boundaries become familiar 
      sights. The crucibles will be more difficult to clean and deformations in 
      the casting dish may cause difficulty in releasing the bead and will 
      increase errors in the reported result.</P>
      <P>Some 
      degree of maintenance on the platinum ware can be carried out by the user. 
      With a suitable die and hydraulic press, casting dishes can be re-pressed 
      to keep them perfectly flat and formers may be available from the supplier 
      for crucibles and dishes. The most effective form of maintenance however 
      is polishing. A diamond paste of the correct grade can be used to polish 
      the surface of the platinum alloy. This will remove a small amount of the 
      surface to get back to the original alloy. It will also have the effect of 
      smoothing out any minor scratches or imperfections on the surface. For 
      more serious scratches and surface damage, a coarse diamond paste can be 
      used, prior to final polishing with a fine paste.</P>
      <P>The life 
      of platinum ware can be extended by careful use and polishing, but it 
      should be noted that polishing will reduce the weight of the platinum, 
      subsequently reducing the amount of credit on replacement. In time, the 
      platinum will crystallise and crack to which the only solution is 
      replacement. Polishing should primarily be considered as a means of 
      maintaining the quality of results and not as a means of artificially 
      extending the life of the alloy.</P>
      <P>The 
      polishing kit supplied by Analysco comprises one or three grades of 
      polishing paste.</P>
      <P>Grade A &ndash; 
      for routine polishing to maintain surface and finish</P>
      <P>Grades B 
      and C &ndash; Two stage grinding and polishing for surface damaged casting 
      dishes</P>
      <P>Lubricant and cylindrical felt bobs 
      for polishing casting dishes are also included.</P>
      <P>A small 
      amount of diamond paste should be placed onto the flat, end surface of the 
      polishing bob. Taking care to keep the surface of bob flat on the casting 
      dish, polish with a circular motion, adding small quantities of lubricant 
      from the dispenser, as needed to keep the mixture fluid. After polishing, 
      the platinum should be washed in warm water with detergent and dried. If 
      stored carefully, the polishing bob can be used many times over. Make sure 
      however if you are using different grades of polishing paste, to keep the 
      bobs separate and appropriately labelled.</P>
      <P>Polishing 
      by hand can be quite labour intensive and therefore some users may 
      consider using a power tool. The bobs are fitted with a shank for fitting 
      in the chuck of an electric drill which could be mounted in a suitable 
      stand. Appropriate safety rules should be observed in this case. 
      Additionally, it must be stressed that a great deal of care needs to be 
      taken when using a power tool. Platinum will be removed much more quickly 
      and if the bob is not perfectly flat against the surface of the casting 
      dish, gouges can be made in the surface. Further advice on this method is 
      available if required.</P>
