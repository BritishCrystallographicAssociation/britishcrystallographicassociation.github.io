</h4>
<h5>Morning Session</h5>
<a name="Ingham"></a>
<strong>Introduction &amp; tour of BGS.
<br> <i>Mark Ingham, British Geological Survey.</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The tour (in two groups) will take in the main XRF laboratory with Energy and Wavelength dispersive systems and the new mobile laboratory with both bench top EDXRF and handheld EDXRF systems. 
<hr>
<a name="Doyen"></a>
<strong>Keynote lecture - "From Catalyst to Final Product: An overview of XRF analytical and sample preparation techniques in a leading European R&amp;D Polymer Laboratory."
<br><i>Dany Doyen, INEOS Polyolefins, Belgium. </i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
A wide variety of materials are used in the production of modern polymers. 
The manufacturing process involves catalysts, raw materials, additives and 
finally the finished plastic products.  This process leads to a diverse 
array of sample types that pose a challenge to the XRF analyst.  This 
keynote lecture addresses each stage of manufacturing and gives details on 
analytical and sample preparation techniques that have been developed to 
meet the challenge.  Techniques for samples such as powders, plastics, 
pressed pellets and fusion beads will be examined.</p>

<hr>
<a name="Schwarz"></a>
<strong>"A Discussion on the Estimation of Uncertainties in XRF measurements." 
<br> <i>Ros Schwarz, LSM Ltd.</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Measurement of uncertainty is very important in method development and validation. 
This session begins with a review of some sources of help and advice on this topic, 
such as the EURACHEM/CITAC guide and BS EN ISO 12677:2003. 
Some practical examples from the wide variety of matrices analysed at LSM 
will be briefly outlined to lead into a discussion session on the topic.
<hr>
<a name="Beveridge"></a>
<h5>Afternoon Session</h5>
<strong>"Silver Determination in Photographic Emulsion by EDXRF" 
<br><i>David Beveridge, Harman Technology Ltd - IlfordPHOTO</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Silver determination in photographic emulsion is a critical measurement within 
the industry. It has traditionally been done by titration with thioacetamide. 
An EDXRF technique is described here, which gives acceptable precision and 
avoids the toxic hazards associated with the titration method.
<hr>
<a name="Townend"></a>
<strong>"How Corus Group Share Best Practice" <br>
<i>Ann Townend , Corus plc.</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Corus as an international metals company provides steel and aluminium
products to customers worldwide. Two years ago  Chemist Committee Knowledge
Exchange  Groups (or CCKEG groups  for short)  were created in three main
analytical  areas XRF, OES and Wet chemistry. My presentation covers the
work carried out by the XRF CCKEG and the exchange of best practices from
four different Corus sites.

<hr>

<a name="Lawson"></a>
<strong>"XRF and Coating Processes at Cranfield University" <br>
<i>K. J. Lawson.</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>

The presentation summarises some of the major coatings activity in the National 
High Temperature and Surface Engineering Centre at Cranfield University.   
The application of XRF, using an S2 Ranger multisample system is discussed.   
Specific areas demonstrated are materials for aerospace gas turbine applications 
such as, zirconia-based ceramics used for thermal barrier coatings, superalloys 
and bond coats.  Particular emphasis is made as to the importance of analysis of 
trace elements in the materials, the concentrations of rare earth oxide dopants 
and their importance in thermal barrier coating technology.   Some of the 
coating process technology will be presented and the use of XRF to monitor 
the output of processes.

Many workers (e.g. Henderson et al., 2004), including 
ourselves are currently carrying out provenancing studies of ancient glasses by 
means of a variety of chemical analysis techniques including, XFR, LA-ICP-MS and 
EPMA followed by the application of statistical analysis. Differences in raw materials and 
manufacturing techniques manifest themselves as variations in the chemistry of 
the final glass.It is these 
differences e.g. sand used as a silica source as apposed to quartz, than enable 
the differentiation of a glass made at one site from 
another.<br>
<p>&nbsp;</br>
Forensic analysis of glass (e.g. window glass) is 
often used to connect suspects with crime scenes.At present 35% of container glass in the 
UK is recycled and 80 &ndash; 90% in Europe (www.britglass.org.uk).
It may be that this form of glass is now 
more difficult or impossible to provenance because of recycling.Glasses from different parts of the 
world are exported and may be recycled with lots of other glasses manufactured 
elsewhere.<br>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
We have carried out a small study to investigate the 
provenancing of wine bottles. X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRF) has been used 
to distinguish between the locations where modern glass bottles were 
manufactured. By analysing glass bottles for their trace element contents, and subsequently applying statistical 
analysis in the form of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), it may still be 
possible to discriminate between modern bottles made in different locations (see 
Fig. 1).<br>

<strong>"A different use for ED-XRF within the Pharmaceutical Industry"</strong> <br>

<p>&nbsp;<br>


General Use Materials (GUMs) are routinely analysed by time consuming and 
complex instruments (such as titration and ion chromatography) to perform 
relatively simple identity testing. It is desirable to simplify and speed up 
this process.<br><br>
A PANalytical Minipal4 EDXRF spectrometer was evaluated for this purpose 
using several inorganic compounds from the GUMs list. This instrument 
is a relatively small, simple, low cost spectrometer. The XRF technique is 
inherently simple and quick and requires virtually no sample preparation.<br><br>
The compounds tested can be identified qualitatively by overlaying with 
reference spectra but this does require some expert knowledge in interpreting 
the spectra. The main technical objective of the evaluation was to establish 
the basis of a method that could reliably distinguish between compounds using a 
quantitative approach. This method should be suitable for relatively 
inexperienced operators with very little need to interpret the spectra.

<strong>"XRF in the glass industry" <br>

9 Churchill Way, Chapeltown, Sheffield  S35 2PY.</i></strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br>


Glass is a material that has been around for thousands of years and while 
remaining commonplace in everyday life, glass can still be found at the leading 
edge of technology. The chemical composition of glass has a direct impact on 
the properties of the material, this will influence its technical and physical 
properties so accurate analysis of the composition is vital.
<br>The presentation will encompass glass formation, production and physical 
properties. GTS works with glass manufacturers all around the world and is 
uniquely placed to offer solutions to technological problems. 
<br>Prime amongst these is the issue of glass colour caused by low level 
contamination of the raw materials, cullet and from the furnace itself. GTS 
is developing method for analysing the majority of trace colourants commonly 
found in glass in order to help customers solve problems. Allied with this is 
the development of specialist drift correct glasses for the use with XRF 
instruments containing detectable quantities of multiple elements.
