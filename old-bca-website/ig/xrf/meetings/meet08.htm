The preparation and presentation of mineral samples for XRF analysis.<br>
<i><small>X-Ray Fluoresence Analysis (XRFA) is one technique amongst many these 
days that can offer chemical analysis of mineral samples. Everyone is aware that 
different minerals possess different properties but what are the consequences of 
these properties in the analytical process? A brief review of the commonly used 
preparation and presentation techniques will highlight some of the potential 
pitfalls and possible solutions. <br>
Today an increasing range of analytical demands for a wider range of 
environmental monitoring in particular is encouraging more labs and 
analysts into unfamiliar working territory. The demand for quantitative 
chemical analysis for a range of different types of mineralogical samples 
can be met by XRFA, a relatively cheap, sensitive and robust technique but 
as with most good science this throws up more questions. How do XRFA results 
compare against those from other techniques and are we comparing like with like? 
Just what are we actually analysing? Is it really non-destructive analysis? 
Is non-destructive analysis such an advantage? How much sample is actually 
required? How should the results be quoted? We probably won't answer all these 
and the other questions that arise in the meeting today but we should be able 
to let them colour our thinking rather than cloud our judgement.

<p><b>10:30 John Mansell</b>, Omya UK Ltd.<br>
Limestone Parts Per Million to Percent using ED-XRF.<br>
<i><small>An investigation to measure the elemental concentration in limestone 
using ED-XRF has been undertaken.  Elements ranging from parts per million to 
high percentage is required as part of a finger print study.  An S2 Ranger 
from Brüker was used for this investigation.  This application is also to be 
used for quality control, complaint investigation and to reduce the workload 
in the laboratory and the laboratories environmental impact from chemicals 
going to waste.

<p><b>11:00 Margaret West</b>, West X-ray Solutions Ltd.<br>
A new BSI standard for the analysis of glass making sands.<br>
<i><small>BSI provide organisations from all sectors of industry with best 
practice solutions and standards that represent and support the needs of 
business and society in the UK and worldwide. The Society of Glass Technology 
work with BSI to ensure that British, European and international standards are 
relevant to the needs of the glass industry. Many glassworks do not have 
analytical facilities "in-house" and appoint an external laboratory. 
Furthermore, for those glassworks that are part of an international group, 
analytical facilities may vary from tried and tested "wet" methods to 
automated instrumentation. It is therefore important to ensure that the 
industry has a framework for an overall approach for the production and 
management of analytical systems and that defined and consistent nomenclature 
is available to avoid confusion. 
<br>
This presentation will give an overview of a new standard method for the 
analysis of glass making sands by XRF, and where appropriate, ICP-OES, UV-VIS, 
AAS and combustion techniques. </small></i>

<p><b>11:30 John Boyle</b>, University of Liverpool.<br>
Geochemical analysis of lake sediment cores by XRF.<br>
<i><small>Geochemical analysis of lake sediment cores by XRF presents some special challenges. 
For high resolution studies little sediment is available, so sample size is small 
and non destructive (loose powder) approaches are preferred, restricting the 
accuracy and precision of the measurements.  Furthermore, rapid and extreme 
stratigraphic change in matrix type is common in lake sediment records, 
requiring approaches to matrix effect and overlap correction, and to calibration, 
that are as generalised as possible. Finally, lake sediments are highly 
heterogeneous such that reliable characterisation depends as much on sample 
number as on the precision of individual measurements. This talk presents the 
approach we have developed at Liverpool, illustrating it using a number of case studies.</small></i>

 <i><small>When Preparation is not an option...  <br>
For a geologist undertaking XRFS analysis, the use of sample preparation to 
improve the quality of data is normal practice. The analysis of cores and 
archive materials do however pose problems for XRFS as does the increasing 
accuracy required of field-based techniques. Often there is no alternative to 
in-situ testing and irreplaceable materials may require preservation in their 
original state. While XRFS is a non-destructive technique, sample preparation 
is not. This talk will cover the XRFS analysis of unique geological materials 
where sub-sampling and sample preparation is simply not an option. </small>

</p>
<p><b>14:00 Prof. Graham Martin</b>, Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
Heritage and XRF - unlikely companions?<br>
<i><small>The heritage sector is not one of those areas of application for XRF 
that immediately springs to mind. However, distributed around the world in 
something like 15 different location from The State Hermitage, St Petersburg, 
The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, the British Museum and through to 
the V&amp;A XRF finds many areas of use in heritage.<br>

The presentation will overview the present XRF system at the V&amp;A and illustrate the use with example.

<p><b>14:30 Owen Butler </b>, Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), Buxton.<br>
and <b>Elke Adriaenssens </b>,Vlaamse Millieumaatschappij (VMM), Antwerp, Belgium.<br>
Analysis of heavy metals in suspended airborne particles collected on filter papers by XRF techniques.<br>
<i><small>This joint presentation will describe the use of XRF in a regulatory environment 
for the analysis of air filter samples. In the first half of the presentation, 
Owen will initially present an overview of procedures used at HSL to present 
paper filter samples to their instrumentation. He will then describe some 
ongoing work to generate and certify new instrument calibration filters samples. 
Elke will then describe ongoing work at VMM, the Flemish Environmental Agency, 
where XRF techniques are used to monitor airborne heavy metal pollution in 
ambient air. Owen will conclude the presentation by outlining XRF 
developments in this measurement arena.

<p><b>15:30 Richard Meeres</b>, Bureau of Analysed Samples Limited.<br>
A History of the Development of Certified Reference Materials.<br>
<i><small>
This paper will chart how Ridsdale &amp; Co Ltd introduced Standard Samples 
(as they were known in the early 1900's) to the UK, and will describe how the 
progression of these products to Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) developed 
under the guidance of their Associates, Bureau of Analysed Samples Ltd (BAS).<br>

	The presentation will explain the enormous influence of the Ridsdale Family 
	in these activities and will detail how BAS remains at the forefront of 
	production and supply of iron, steel, non-ferrous metal and mineral CRMs 
	worldwide.  Their recent link with the equally longstanding and prestigious 
	Contract Analysis Company, Pattinson &amp; Stead, who specialise in the analyses 
	of ores and minerals, will also be described.

<p><b>16:00 Alison Burke</b>, Huntsman Pigments.<br>
Routine Analysis of TiO<sub>2</sub> by WD XRF.<br>
<i><small>Huntsman Pigments is a global manufacturer of pigmentary titanium 
dioxide which is used in a wide variety of applications including coatings, 
plastics and inks. WD XRF is a key analytical technique used to monitor process 
control and final pigment quality thereby ensuring product consistency for our 
customers. This paper will describe the challenges in establishing harmonisation 
of the XRF analysis between the group laboratories and the controls in place to 
maintain the analytical agreement.

<p><b>16:20 Andy Scothern, Saint-Gobain Gypsum.</b> <br>
XRF analysis in the Gypsum Industry.<br>
<i><small>The gypsum industry delivers plaster and plasterboard products for a
wide variety of customers and applications.  Knowledge of material
properties, and how these may change, is essential for manufacturing
efficiency, process control and product development.  The Gypsum
Technical Centre (GTC) in the UK is the leading research facility of
Saint-Gobain Gypsum.  The GTC laboratories incorporate a large range of
analytical techniques, including XRF, that support the key development
