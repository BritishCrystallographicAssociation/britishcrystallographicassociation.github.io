</center>

<p><b>Samantha Towlson (Pilkington PLC)</b>provided a
refreshingly clear overview of patents covering the complete
field from what a patent is, the benefits of owning one, what can
be patented, how the process works, and concluding with some
examples.</p>
<p><b>Jeremy Cockcroft (UCL/Birkbeck)</b> lecture titled
&ldquo;Crystallography for Patents&rdquo; covered information
types in the context of patents and contrasted the information
rich single crystal data, routinely collected at 150K, with the 1
dimensional data sets that may be obtained by XRPD. He
highlighted the fact that the intensity information obtained
using flat plate presentations is often inaccurate due to
preferred orientation effects and that data collected using a
transmission geometry was much more reliable. He advocated the
sole use of peak position data in instances where the intensity
data was unreliable and the use of indexing to confirm that the
presented data was consistent with a single phase and pointed out
that crystallographer often chose the unit cell on the basis of
one whose angles are 90 degrees rather than necessarily the
smallest volume.</p>
<p><b>Gareth Lewis (Astra Zeneca)</b> provided an overview of the
lead optimisation as applied within their company indicating that
their preference was to develop a crystalline compound based on a
literature search that showed that of the 4700 drugs on the
market only 7 are amorphous. He highlighted the importance of
identifying the most stable crystalline modifications that a
compound may exist in during the compounds early development. A
small (and manual) polymorph screen is carried out internally and
typically consists of 10-100 experiments. During late development
it was then important to identify all the potential crystalline
modifications:-</p>

</center>
<p>A final polymorph screen of the most pure material from the
final route of synthesis concludes the solid state form screen.
Such screen appears to be carried out externally and typically
consist of 100-1000 experiments. The methodology employed
includes full structural characterisation using single crystal,
XRPD and IR and then DSC TGA and hot stage microscopy. He
explained the use of X-ray powder data to access non ambient
data</p>
<p>X-ray is used both qualitatively and quantitatively through
the use of characteristic peaks and pattern matching using le
Bail/Pawley fit methods or Rietveld analysis which requires the
single crystal data for the appropriate forms.</p>
<p><b>Martin Vickers(UCL/Birkbeck)</b> provided an example of the
type of data included in a patent application which demonstrated
that the data may be of questionable quality; as in this case one
of the diffraction patterns purporting to be a different solid
sate form was consistent with the material simply exhibiting
preferred orientation effects.</p>
<p><b>Jeremy Cockcroft (UCL/Birkbeck)</b> provided an example
where quantitative X-ray powder diffraction data had been used in
a patent case in an attempt to demonstrate that one company was
infringing another&rsquo;s patent on a livestock disinfectant
which may contain sodium chloride at a levels as low as 0.025% as
a result of the synthetic route based on the use of sodium
dichloroisocyanurate. Using a method of standard additions it is
possible to determine the concentration of the un-spiked material
providing peak overlaps do not preclude this. Various
presentation methods were considered and capillary was ruled out
due to the relatively high background produced by the glass tube.
Care in smoothing data is also indicated as his experience has
shown that this may generate false peaks.</p>
<p><b>Mike Glazer (University of Oxford)</b> lectured on
crystallographic patents and seeding. He related his experience
of being an expert witness and supplied his rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not lie.</li>
<li>Do not actively help the opposition.</li>
<li>Be aware of yourself and do not be tempted into discussion
topics that you are not completely familiar with.</li>
<li>Talk slowly and consider carefully before making a
statement.</li>
<li>Keep things simple.</li>
<li>Do not take with you to court any notes, papers or anything
that you do not want the opposition to know about.</li>
<li>Do not make copious notes.</li>
<li>You are the expert.</li>
</ol>
<p>He then cited a case in which the manufacture of a particular
solid state form of Cephadroxyl monohydrate which is covered by a
patent, that relates to a new method of synthesis, and material
manufactured by the old process for which the patent has lapsed.
The work demonstrated that care has to be exercised in quoting
characteristic peaks as if this is too loosely defined it is
possible for the opposition to claim that they are making the
original solid state form and not infringing your patent.<br>
The highlight of the talk was a double act with Bob Gould
re-enacting a transcript from an american court case, emphasizing
the points made and demonstrating the aggressive nature of cross
examination.</p>

<h3>Autumn Meeting "Patents &amp; Crystallography in Industry"
19<sup>th</sup> Oct 2005</h3>
<h5>School of Crystallography, Birkbeck College, London.</h5>
<h6>Morning session - Patents.</h6>
<center>

<small>From Left to Right: Chris Frampton, Richard Morris (chair)
and Roger Savidge.</small></p>
</center>
<p><strong>Chris Frampton (Pharmophix)</strong> talked on
&ldquo;Case Studies by an Expert Witness&rdquo;. Despite claiming
not to be an expert at being an &lsquo;expert witness&rsquo;,
Chris gave some excellent general advice on the duties and
obligations of an expert witness. This included GLP (good
laboratory practice), confidentiality, reporting and being
prepared for unpleasant cross examination by the QC. Also how to
give opinion within the boundaries of your remit, and being
representative of peers in the XRPD industry, whilst avoiding the
trap of being inventive yourself. He gave a couple of
pharmaceutical examples, one of which was the classic tale of
Paraxetine Hydrochloride, and the disappearing polymorph. It was
noted that solvate forms, of which hydrates are a subset, are not
polymorphs.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Savidge (Consultant)</strong> then gave an
insight into &ldquo;Patents and Crystallography&rdquo; from the
users perspective, and cleared up some of the misconceptions.
There are only national patents, although these can be applied
for through regional (eg. European) or World (PCT) patent
offices. The 20 year timescale was described, and the importance
of keeping all the parts of your invention confidential until
final application. In terms of exploitation, a granted patent
does not give the inventor the exclusive right to exercise his
invention, merely the right to prevent others. Thus in practice
the patent holder, may <i>require</i> licenses from other
inventors whose patents overlap in some way, and he may also
<i>grant</i> a licence to others to use the invention
commercially. You are not allowed in any way to threaten
potential customers by suggesting that your competition may be
infringing a patent. You are well advised to go through your
solicitor.</p>

</center>
<p><strong>Low angle Round Robin preliminary results, <i>David
Taylor, consultant</i></strong></p>
<p>David opened by explaining that the purpose of the Round Robin
was to test the suitability of Silver Behenate to become a
certified low angle intensity standard. The Round Robin would
also provide direct intensity comparison between different
equipment and set-ups and would provide participants with
feedback on instrument performance. 21 users signed up for the
Round Robin, to date 14 had returned data obtained from 17
instruments (1-Bede, 7-Bruker, 8-PANalytical and 1-Stoe). 22 data
sets had been collected including 1 from Holland and 1 from
Taiwan. All the data sets were obtained using copper tubes.</p>
<p>For comparing intensities, the data was normalised for 40mA
current. 'Figure of Merits' were calculated for each data set.
David said that some interesting information was coming through
for example some users had quite high background counts at low
angles. More data analysis will be carried out to explore affects
due to slit size (variable VS fixed) and counting time. A full
report will be published in due course and added to the
Industrial Group's web pages.<br>
<a class="emph" href="present/LARRppt/Index.htm">View Presentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Standards, <i>Steve Norval, ICI plc</i></strong></p>
<p>Steve updated the meeting on progress towards publishing the new European 
standards ubder the banner "Non-Destructive Testing -
X-ray Diffraction from polycrystalline and amorphous materials".<br>
Those so far published include:</p>
<ul>
      <li>EN13925-1 - General Principles </li>
       <li>EN13925-2 - General Procedure  </li>
       <li>EN13925-3 - Instruments      </li>
</ul>
       <p><i>EN1330-11 - Terminology - is due to be published next year.</br>
       Future subjects include reference materials and phase identification and quantitative analysis.</i> 
</p>

<p>Steve explained that XRPD in industry is used for understand
materials, development of new materials, solving problems,
identification, specification and attributing blame. Laboratories
and departments need to communicate with customers and suppliers
and need to conform to regulations and legislation. Thus,
everyone needs to understand the technical language and XRPD
users need to conform to international standards to obtain
credibility. At a minimum there is a need for common concepts and
terminology, well defined instruments, agreed reference
materials, acceptable procedures and adequate reporting.</p>
<p>The committee is trying to produce structured standards with
standards for overview/common issues, industrial techniques and
specific applications. The three published standards to date
cover general principles (basic concepts, Bragg equation etc),
procedures and instruments. Terminology and Reference Materials
standards are in progress and work on phase identification and
quantitative analysis is starting. Standards could form the basis
of laboratory accreditation and validation of patent data.</p>
<p><strong>Neutron Diffraction - Introduction, <i>Jeremy
Cockcroft, Birkbeck College</i></strong><br>
<small>[The intended speaker Peter Laggner, Institute of
Biophysics and X-ray Structure Research, Austrian Acadmey of
Sciences was unwell and unable to attend. Jeremy stepped in to
present a talk with the same title based on his presentation to
the 2005 BCA Durham School].</small></p>
<p>Jeremy began by describing the properties of a neutron (mass
1, no charge, spin &frac12;, strong interaction with nucleus,
weaker interaction with unpaired electrons). Its kinetic energy
is related to its velocity and temperature. Its coherent
scattering cross-section gives rise to diffraction data -
incoherent scattering contributes to the background signal.</p>
<p>Since neutrons interact with nuclei the point scatterers are
very small compared with the wavelength, unlike X-rays which
interact with the electron cloud - Form Factor. The neutron
pattern does exhibit decreasing intensity with 1/d. For neutron
shielding, B<sub>4</sub>C doped rubber, plastics or cadmium metal
sheet is used. <sup>6</sup>Li is very good but is rarely used
since in is normally extracted from the lithium containing ore
for military use!</p>
<p>Detection relies on the absorption by the atomic nucleus with
the simultaneous emission of a gamma-ray. ILL Grenoble is still
Europe's highest flux neutron source. The reactor consists of 10g
of <sup>235</sup>U surrounded by heavy water cooled to 35C. 'Hot'
and 'Cold' sources produce long wavelength and short wavelength
neutrons respectively. The neutrons are transmitted along nickel
coated curved guides - Guide Halls. The beam from the reactor is
a 'white' beam (continuous range of wavelengths). Selected
wavelengths can be obtained by use of monochromators. The sample
holders are high temperature quartz tubes.<br>
Overall, Jeremy gave a very interesting and comprehensive
overview of the subject of Neutron Diffraction.</p>
<p><strong>An in-situ study of a redox catalyst analysed by
Rietveld refinement, <i>Olivier Leynaud, Birkbeck
College</i></strong></p>
<p>In-situ diffraction arises from the need to understand what is
happening inside the sample such as identification of
intermediary compounds in a chemical reactions. Needs greater
X-ray flux than produced by laboratory instruments so that quick
reactions can be studied - Time resolved X-ray Diffraction.
Olivier said that in order to meet these requirements,
experiments are carried at Daresbury Laboratory's synchrotron
source. The MPW 6.2PD station with RAPID 2 multi-wire detector
(60degree range) is used. The small oven can be heated up to 950C
and is water and air cooled. Vacuum experiments can also be
carried out. The Fe-Mo-O catalyst system has been studied. An
excess of MoO<sub>3</sub> in Fe-Mo-O has been found to be
beneficial for the stability of the active phase and replenishing
any sublimed Molybdenum. It allows the successful Rietveld
refinement of the XRD patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Structure Analysis of Novel-Templated ALPOs using
CCP14 Software, <i>Richard Stephenson, UCL, Birkbeck
College</i></strong></p>
<p>Novel-Templated ALPOs are a class of crystalline micro porous
materials. Three synthetic mixtures produced the same layered
structure. Introducing a cation e.g. Cobalt produced a different
3D structure i.e. poor reproducibility. Richard said that if
single crystals are produced then it is possible to get
comprehensive information from the refinement of their
diffraction patterns. However, a particular issue is that the
crystal is not representative of the bulk material. The
refinement programs used can be viewed at the ccp14 web site (<a class="emph"
href="http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/">www.ccp14.ac.uk</a> or <a class="emph" href=
"http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/solution/xtalrefine/">www.ccp14.ac.uk/solution/xtalrefine/</a>).</p>
<p>Crystals Software: Has an in-built wizard and there is guided
structure refinement. A 'Supervisor' routine makes
recommendations for further improvement. The refinement process
can be followed with in-built graphics and electron density maps
can be generated.</p>
<p>WINGX Suite for Windows: It is compatible with the Shelx range
of programs. Resulting density maps can be viewed in Contour and
Map view.</p>
<p>For structural refinement of powder diffraction data there is
a large range of programs. However, they are not as sophisticated
as those for single crystal data. They have the EXPQUI Interface
for Rietveld programs such as Rietica, Ortex (image and movie
animations) and Struplo for Windows (polyhedral structure
drawings).</p>
