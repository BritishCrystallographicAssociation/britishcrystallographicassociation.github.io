<p>This keynote lecture is a cornerstone of Industrial
Group Meetings and has played an important part of both Spring and Autumn offerings.</p>
<p>The lectures were started in 1997 as a lasting tribute to
Professor Alun Bowen's contribution to Industrial
Crystallography, which is documented in his <a class = "emph" href=
"../cnews/ab.htm">obituary</a> on this site and in the Times. His
widow and surviving daughter collected the posthumous <a class = "emph" href=
"../reps96.htm#award96">Industrial Group Award</a> at the
November meeting 1996.</p>
<p>He served on the Industrial Group committee from 1984 and
retired as Chairman in 1992. He continued his service as a BCA
Council member giving that important industrial perspective. He
was a once in a lifetime industrial crystallographer, at the
fore front of the science, an acknowledged expert in texture and
stress analysis - a model to his peers.</p>

<h4>Professor Paul Barnes</h4>
<p>Industrial Materials Group. Department of Crystallography,
Birkbeck College, Malet Street, London WCIB 7HX, U.K.</p>
<p><i>Cine-cystallography</i> implies (primarily) a
time-dependent element to observation, whereas the <i>plus</i>
refers to the use, simultaneous or otherwise, of more than one
structural probe. These aspects complement the themes of this
year's Industrial Group sessions. In this lecture I will indicate
how certain techniques (e.g. synchrotron/neutron
diffraction/scattering, EXAFS, computer-simulation) can be
combined in this way, particularly with the view of reproducing
specimen conditions that mimic real conditions in the synthesis
and in-service performance of functional materials. I will give
examples of application in the following three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>synthesis of ceramics.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>zeolite ion-exchange and dehydration.<br>
<br>
</li>

<h3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF X-RAY ANALYSIS</h3>
<h4>Professor Robert L Snyder</h4>
<p>Department of Materials Science and Engineering,</p>
<p>The Ohio State University, 2041 College Rd., Columbus OH 43210
USA.</p>
<p>The discovery of X-ray radiation by Roentgen in 1895 lit the
fuse, which resulted in a sequential series of explosions, which
blew away the shroud of ignorance surrounding the atomic nature
of matter. Each explosion produced a new method for probing
atomic secrets collectively known today as X-ray Analysis. From
today's perspective the rapidity of these events is breathtaking:
Diffraction - von Laue, 1912; Fluorescence - Moseley, 1913;
Crystal Structure Analysis - Braggs 1913; Amorphous Scattering -
Debye, 1915; Powder Diffraction - Debye &amp; Scherrer, 1916;
Crystallite Size Analysis - Scherrer, 1918; Indexing - Hull &amp;
Davey, 1921; Absorption Spectroscopy - Glocker &amp; Frohnmeyer.
1923; Preferred Orientation Analysis - Wever, 1924; Residual
Stress Analysis - Lester &amp; Aborn, 1925; Quantitative
Analysis, Navias, 1925; X-ray Reflection - Kiessig, 1931; Small
Angle Scattering - Warren, 1937; Qualitative Analysis, Hanawalt,
Rinn &amp; Frevel - 1938.</p>
<p>Within about fifteen years of the discovery most of the
principal tools of X-ray analysis were in place and ready to grow
to the powerful methods we know today. The modern applications of
X-ray powder diffraction: qualitative and quantitative analysis,
size-strain analysis, indexing, preferred orientation and
structure analysis, have produced solutions to problems that
could not have been imagined by the fathers of the method.</p>
<p>The development of synchrotron sources has catalysed a new
explosion of techniques in characterisation. Wavelength
tunability allows diffraction analysis on each side of absorption
edges, EXAFS and XANES analysis of poorly crystalline and
amorphous materials, and 3D non-destructive tomographic analysis.
High resolution X-ray and neutron instruments have permitted
structure analysis to such level of detail that the fundamentals
of high temperature superconductivity can be revealed. Other
techniques such as total reflection diffraction, and
fluorescence, and reflectometry have opened the world of thin
film structure and properties to close examination.</p>
<p>The development of very efficient Position Sensitive Detectors
(PSD) have opened powder diffraction methods to a wide range of
time dependent studies. The most dramatic application of these
"dynamic techniques" is to materials studies in real time
monitoring of reactions, phase transitions, kinetics, stress
development and sintering of crystallites, by taking rapid "snap
shot" patterns of a material while heating it on a hot stage.</p>
<p>This paper will trace the origins of the applications of X-ray
powder diffraction through to the modern era showing examples at
the state of the art.</p>

<h3>Forensic Applications of X-rays</h3>
<h4>David Rendle</h4>
<p>Metropolitan Laboratory, Forensic Science Service,<br>
109 Lambeth Road, LONDON SE1 7LP, United Kingdom</p>
<p>Forensic science is the science behind expert evidence, and
its strict definition is simply that science which is used in the
law courts. X-ray techniques, just as many other analytical
methods, have been used in forensic science for several decades.
The main applications of X-rays are in X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-radiography.</p>
<p>The need for non-destructive methods of analysis in order to
preserve evidence can be of great importance, although this
requirement may vary from country to country depending upon the
prevailing criminal justice system. Most courts understand, and
accept, that chemical analysis can result in destruction of a
specimen, but in certain instances, Counsel may insist on seeing
the specimen that was analysed, and having that same specimen
re-analysed by their own scientists. In view of this, it is wise
to use non-destructive analytical methods, where possible, as a
matter of course. XRD, XRF and Radiography meet this requirement
admirably.</p>
<p>The complementary techniques of XRD and XRF are used mainly in
contact trace analysis. So-called contact traces (paint flakes,
glass fragments, hair and fibres (natural and man-made), slivers
of metal, soils, building materials, stains of any description,
corrosion products and loose powdered materials) appear in the
traditional areas of forensic science, where the identification
and comparison of trace quantities of material can help in the
conviction or exoneration of a person suspected of involvement in
a crime. X-radiography has a role in the examination of a wide
variety of objects, from light, low density objects such as
documents using soft X-rays, to more dense objects using harder
X-rays and electronography.</p>
<p>There is now, as never before, a perceived need to provide the
investigating officer with as much useful scientific information
as possible <i>at the crime scene</i>. The time saved by
providing pertinent scientific information to the officer at the
scene may be crucial to the way he/she directs the investigation.
Development of instrumentation, particularly X-ray sources and
detectors, with a view to miniaturization and hence portability
of equipment, will be of paramount importance. Software
requirements will mean Lap-top or Palm-top computers of
sufficient power to process spectroscopic/diffraction data
quickly, and the ability to accommodate a database and a
search/match routine with an option for quantitative
analysis.</p>

<h3>CRYSTALLIZATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS</h3>
<h4>S. R. BYRN, <i>J. G. STOWELL, X. HE, G. STEPHENSON, AND U.
GRIESSER,</i></h4>
<p>PURDUE UNIVERSITY, WEST LAFAYETTE, IN</p>
<p>Crystallization of pharmaceuticals is a critical step in drug
development. Crystallization allows control of the form as well
as purification. Crystallization results in a drug substance
(API) with controlled properties. The crystal form and the
process for preparing it represents intellectual property and is
sometimes protected by patents or trade secrets or both.
Approaches to crystallization will be introduced. Three
nonsolvated systems will be reviewed, ROY, 4'-methylROY, and WAY.
In each case, crystallization of the forms will be reviewed and
an energy temperature diagram will be constructed. This diagram
will be used to explain how a crystallization strategy for each
form of 4'-methylROY was developed. The crystal structure will
also be used to explain how additives were used to stabilize
unstable polymorphs of WAY. The crystal structures of the
"tunnel" hydrates caffeine, theophylline, thiamine, and orotic
acid will be also be reviewed. In these cases the use of the
crystal structure to explain stability will be highlighted.
Throughout the discussions, the powerful combination of crystal
structure with other analytical techniques will be illustrated.
This research was supported, in part, by the Purdue-Wisconsin
Program on the Physical and Chemical Stability of Pharmaceutical
Solids.</p>

<h3>CRYSTALLOGRAPHY IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.</h3>
<h4>Colin Small, Rolls-Royce plc, P.O.Box 31, Derby, DE24 8BJ,
UK</h4>
<p>Crystallography in the aerospace industry? Well if you were to
go and ask my managers what they think about this subject you
would be met with nearly blank stares. It is not that they do not
know about the subject, most of them have scientific degrees that
contain some physics. It is just that they are unaware that
Rolls-Royce has a crystallography facility and that it is used to
help solve development and service problems on gas turbine
engines. The reason this happens is that telling a field service
engineer that his engine (which at this point is usually not
working) is full of Fe2O3 and CaSO4 (together with their
associated lattice parameters) is not a useful answer. Similarly
if you put a pole figure up in front of them and say ' this is
why your material does not behave they way you think it does',
they run away shouting 'I don't understand'. This is not to say
that they are Philistines, its just that the answer in this form
is not useful to them. Thus the job of the crystallographer in
this industry is to apply the physics and technology, get the
crystallography based answer and then turn it into information
that engineers what and are willing to use. A couple of examples
will illustrate this point:</p>
<p>(1) Gas turbines are wonderful vacuum cleaners- they swallow
large amounts of grit and dust along with the air they need to
operate. The dust reacts in the combustion chamber and on the hot
turbine components. The reacted products can be very aggressive
and cause premature failure of the components. Crystallography is
needed to identify what is coming in, what is reacting, and how
the reaction products affect the engine components. In reality,
the questions being asked and answered are; what is it? Where
does it come from? What can be done to stop it? You very quickly
find yourself becoming a detective looking at not just
crystallography, but also geology, chemistry and even phase
equilibria to solve this sort of problem. However, the initial
clues come from the crystallography.</p>
<p>(2) Texture has a direct influence on the mechanical
properties of thin, rolled metal sheet. Yet, it is the one
property that the process engineers usually ignore because 'you
cannot see it'. They will look at chemistry, microstructure,
rolling schedules, infact just about anything before they even
consider it. However, if you put a highly textured material into
service unexpected failures can be linked directly to the
development and control of the underlying crystallographic
distribution. In this case the crystallographer has to find a way
of communicating highly abstract concepts in a way that are
interesting, useful and that can be used by non-specialists. They
also have to introduce new analytical techniques and ways of
representing the data while keeping the working understanding
that the engineering fraternity has developed and is comfortable
with. This is a challenge but a highly satisfying one when you
realise how far texture is now an accepted, used and controlled
part of our manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>(3) Through this talk I will expand and illustrate these
points and show you that crystallography in the aerospace
industry is an essential analytical tool - even if no one in the
industry knows about it.</p>

<h3>STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING STUDIES USING HIGH ENERGY X-RAY
DIFFRACTION.</h3>
<h4>Alexander M. Korsunsky, Department of Engineering Science,
University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PJ, U.K.</h4>
<p>At the Forum 2 meeting - 14th November 2003, Birkbeck College,
London.</p>
<p>The availability of high flux, high energy X-ray instruments
suitable for structural engineering research at SRS, Daresbury
and ESRF, Grenoble has seen major improvements in the last
decade. This led to systematic advances in various uses of high
energy X-ray beams for non-destructive engineering analysis. Some
of the recent achievements will be illustrated that are likely to
determine avenues for further development.</p>
<p>The future will be strongly affected by the advent of new
facilities, notably the dedicated engineering instrument JEEP and
accompanying support facilities on DIAMOND, alongside the
existing ENGIN-X neutron scanner. Although past may be a poor
indicator of the future, it is all we have to go on in our
attempts to provide the best engineering facility for years to
come. I shall try to discuss the strategy for engineering
instrumentation development in the light of industrially
motivated research driving it.</p>

<h2>2006 Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture</h2>
<h3>STRUCTURAL RELEVANCE AND ANALYSIS OF POLYMORPHISM IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT.</h3>
<h4>Ulrich Griesser, Institute of Pharmacy, University of Innsbruck, 
Innrain 52, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.</h4>
<p>At the 2006 Spring Meeting, Lancaster.</p>
<p>The fact that most of the active drug ingredients can exist in different 
crystal forms has attracted strong attention in pharmaceutical industry within 
the last decade. Interestingly, this interest was triggered by patent 
litigations and economic reasons rather than the awareness of the scientific 
challenge of this solid state phenomenon. The main push for the increasing 
research on solid state properties of new drug entities still comes from the 
regulatory requirements as well as issues related to patents of specific 
crystal forms. One result of all these activities is doubtless a more rational 
based drug development and manufacturing compared to the decades where 
polymorphism was largely ignored in industry. The second is the benefit and 
stimulus for various fields of basic and applied science such as structural 
and supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering or theoretical and 
computational chemistry. Furthermore, the often subtle differences between 
polymorphs, order-disorder phenomena, low stability etc. offer many challenging 
tasks for all kinds of solid state analytical techniques and force us to 
improve the state of the art and to overcome existing analytical boundaries. 
</p>
<p>In order to understand the basic principles of the interplay of molecular 
recognition, thermodynamics, and kinetics it is clear that a variety of 
analytical techniques are required. Single crystal structure analysis, 
powder diffraction methods and spectroscopic techniques provide evidence 
about molecular assemblies and interactions in the solid state, other 
techniques such as thermal analysis, calorimetry and solubility studies 
give access to the thermodynamic features of polymorphs. 
</p>
<p>This lecture tries to outline some of the basic principles and problems 
of polymorphism in pharmaceuticals. By means of representative examples the 
nature of polymorphs including structural features, phase transition behavior 
and kinetic stability will be illustrated. Furthermore the importance of 
different analytical techniques will be addressed. Some emphasis will be 
placed on one of the pioneer techniques namely hot stage microscopy in order 
to highlight the value of this rather simple analytical tool for characterizing 
polymorphs, understanding solid state transformation phenonema and its 
usefulness for crystallographers solving problems related to crystal 
polymorphism.
