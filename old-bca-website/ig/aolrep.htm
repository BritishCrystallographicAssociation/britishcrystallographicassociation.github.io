<h2><a name="11
89">1989 Autumn Meeting</a></h2>

<p>The most recent of the Group's one-day 'Crystallography in
industry' meetings was held on November 2 1989 at the Technology
and Environmental Centre of National Power at Leatherhead. (As
yet, the venue is better known by the long-established name of
CERL, Leatherhead - the new title being a side-effect of the
impending privatisation of the electricity supply industry.) The
arrangement for the meeting was co-ordinated by Mrs Phyllis
Dolbear, whose team Is to be c
ongratulated for their smoothly
organised occasion.</p>

<p>The day's first paper war presented by Dr J E Chisholm of the
Mineralogy Department of the British Museum (Natural History).
Jim revealed the history of the museum and the place of the
Mineralogy Department within it. The museum's mineral collection
exceeds 300,000 specimens and increases by about 1000 specimens
each year; In addition there are thousands of rock, ocean bottom
deposit and meteorite samples. Debye-Scherrer photographs are
u
sed for identification and archive purposes; over 30,000 films
are in the catalogue and collaborative work with University
College is in hand to digitise the film so that the data can be
made more widely available. In addition, the staff of the
mineralogy department have extensive research Interests in a
variety of geological and mineralogical topics.</p>

<p>In a paper on The Structure of n-Alkanes, Dr A R Gerson
(Strathclyde University) explained work, carried out with her
co-worker at Strathclyd
e and Daresbury on the crystal structures
of C<sub>18</sub> to C<sub>28</sub> n-alkanes, which make up some
three percent of diesel engine fuel. The topic is of much
interest as part of research directed at elimination of the
problem caused by fuel waxing at low ambient temperature. The
high resolution achievable with synchrotron radiation was
employed to reveal that odd carbon-numbered alkanes in this range
had orthorhombic cells, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>38</sub>,
C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>42</sub> and C<sub
>22</sub>H<sub>48</sub> had
triclinic cells whilst C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>50</sub> had a
monoclinic cell. The unit cells of C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>50</sub>
and C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>54</sub> were shown to be monoclinic with
two molecules per unit cell. Dr W I F David (Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory) described several applications of neutron diffraction
techniques, in particular a study of failure mechanisms in
"Duracell" batteries. The high flux available permitted the
in-situ study of chemical reactions yi
elding conclusive
indication of intercalation of hydrogen into manganese dioxide
and the growth of impurity phases associated with battery
failure. It is expected that such experiments will become routine
as a diagnostic tool. Some applications of X-ray Topography of
Semiconductors were described by Dr P J Halfpenny (University of
Strathclyde), illustrating the nature and mechanisms of
introduction of process-induced defects in semiconductor silicon.
Peter stressed the ways in which different defect
 types interact
during device processing.</p>

<p>For economic reasons, Fe-8Mn alloys are attractive as
replacements for Fe-Ni alloys in cryogenic applications. However,
Fe-Mn alloys are susceptible to temper embrittlement. Dr M D
Bramhall (Sheffield City polytechnic) described work on these
alloys, involving xrd and Mossbaur spectroscopy, in which
tempering in (<font face="Symbol">a</font> + <font face=
"Symbol">g</font> ) region of the phase diagram produced reverted
austenite (<font face="Symbo
l">g</font> ) structure in the lath
martenite (<font face="Symbol">a</font><sup>1</sup>) structure,
giving a significant improvement in toughness. The importance of
specimen preparation was stressed - light grinding followed by
electopolishing having proved to be the appropriate route.</p>

<p>The final paper of a very full day was presented by Ranko
Yrcelj (Birkbeck College) who described a CASE project to study
variations in the physical properties of metallic glass, during
changes to the crystal
line counterparts. Two particular areas had
been investigated - the identification of the crystalline
components and the kinetics of the reactions occurring during
crystallisation. It is interesting to note that apart from Jim
Chisholm's "special interest" paper all the day's presentations
were made by speakers who work in Laboratories which are not
owned by industrial companies. Nevertheless the work described
was clearly industrial in nature - an indication of the way in
which the industrial Group
's meetings surmount conventional
boundaries between disciplines.</p>

<p align="CENTER">BCA Spring Meeting 1989, Oxford.</p>

<p>Although the annual BCA. Easter meeting is often associated
with a spell of bad weather (the rains of Bristol and the cold
winds of York) this is the first meeting which will be associated
with an unseasonal flurry of snow - perha
ps not industrial
crystals unless you work at a ski resort - but a strong crystal
theme nevertheless.</p>

<p>The first session was chaired by our outgoing outgoing
chairman Brian Bellamy (outgoing in both character and office),
who didn't even need to detail transatlantic air schedules for us
to appreciate the minor adjustment to the running order to allow
our first speaker to catch an early flight to the U.S.A.</p>

<p>Thus Dr. David Dingly from Bristol University spoke first on
'Microdiffracti
on in the scanning electron microscope for phase
identification and on-line orientation measurement. The initial
description of a method which could work on small and far from
perfect samples, using a stationary probe, at small additional
cost and covering a very large angle was mouth watering.</p>

<p>He also gave a number of well illustrated examples or both the
phase identification and orientation aspects. Stainless steel got
a careful look at 2000 A spatial resolution and a most
interesting exa
mple of NiCl<sub>2</sub> growing epitaxially on
NiS<sub>2</sub> was shown; it had been perhaps a disappointment
to David that he had not discovered a new phase of
NiS<sub>2</sub>, but there was compensation in the fact that XRF
had not been able to detect the chloride phase. Although a piece
of film and some string and sealing wax seem to be all that is
needed to start, the new high gain T.V. cameras have enabled
impressive on-line measurements to be realised; for instance the
fixing of a crystal or
ientation well inside a minute. These
Kikuchi line patterns have led to a new notation for the pole
figures and we had a taste of Frank-Rodrigues space using bees as
a excellent model for the axes. David finished by detailing two
new mineral structures, one cubic and one monoclinic. His
proselytising style was captivating and he was last seen carrying
a suitcase and a pair of snow-shoes out through the registration
area.</p>

<p>Professor Geoff Alien from the Central Electricity Generating
Board, 
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories presented the next talk on
'Interfaces in nuclear materials'. Geoff covered two particular
aspects that have been studied using an impressive battery of
methods the acronymic index of which was mind blowing (I'm still
not sure about ESIMXRPES!). This seemed to be second only in
range to the number of phases from UO<sub>2</sub> to
U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and yet the work on oxygen cluster
geometry has allowed Geoff to rationalise two entire series of
these oxides in 
a most satisfying scheme. The beautiful pictures
of the structures helped us visualise this and appreciate how
increasing insight does (sometimes?) lead to an elegant overview.
The second topic was that of carbon deposition; particularly that
which appears patchily as an unwanted insulating layer where the
gas coolant from a reactor core passes over metal surfaces. A
large number of spinels have been studied and examples of the
Mn/Fe Cr<sub>2</sub>0<sub>4</sub> studied by high angle XRD were
most in
teresting. Carbon contents have been quantified using a
windowless detector and Geoff's final story detailed the studies
of preferential growth on faces of magnetite crystals, the source
of which had taken ten years to find.</p>

<p>Although Professor Richard Joyner is now based at Liverpool
University he was previously working with B.P. and his talk on
'Industrial applications of x-ray absorption spectroscopy'
covered both incarnations. He started with a didactic section on
the techniques of EXAFS
 and XANES and his re-interpretation of
the initials (e.g. Extremely eXpensive And Frustrating
Spectroscopy) of the teenage techniques will be well remembered.
Thus he outlined the physics of these absorption techniques which
are poor for structure determination but excellent for probing
local structure, for liquids as well as solids. Although
experimentally conceptually simple there is the small matter of a
synchrotron for good results and Richard is pleased with the
Daresbury SRS facility and went
 on to outline two examples. The
environment of Ni in heavy crude oils was probed, making use of a
number of standards with square planar Ni and most of the oils
showed a porphyrinic Ni environment. The rhodium based gas
catalyst studied by EXAFS were probed in situ in a high
temperature environmental chamber and most exciting results for
range of gaseous composition were presented showing that in the
industrial CO/H<sub>2</sub> mixture the Rh takes on a quite
metallic looking environment but with a
n expanded Rh-Rh distance
compared to the metal. This is in stark contrast to both the H
only and CO only atmospheres and provided an excellent example of
the advantage of studying industrial materials in their working
environments.</p>

<p>After the break it seemed appropriate that our new chairman
Dr. Alun Bowen took over and his first speaker was Professor Josh
Thomas who had come over from the University of Uppsala to talk
on 'From structure to industrial applications in micro-ionics'.
Althoug
h the ionic conduction of Na beta-alumina has been known
for some 22 years we still do not have electric cars with solid
electrolyte batteries. However this has not discouraged, Josh
from probing the structure - particularly the distribution of the
mobile ions. Unfortunately the space group of the host alumina
lattice imposes symmetry restrictions on the ion positions and
thus simulation techniques have been brought to bear. The
distribution of sodium at various temperatures has been explored
to rev
eal some of the secrets of ion conduction and the
substitution of other ions shows counter-intuitive differences.
The exploitable features of 2-D conduction and high
exchangeability lead to a number of applications and Josh not
only looked at current ideas but was brave enough to look into
his micro-ionic crystal ball. Thus from optical wave guides,
submarine communication (a euphemism for detection?) and lasing
we were taken into a world of a tunable micro-laser, optical
memory, phosphors and humid
ity sensors.</p>

<p>The last talk of the session was from Dr. Mike Barry of ICI
Chemicals and Polymers in Runcorn whose subject 'Consolidation
and coalescence of Latex dispersions studied by small angle
scattering' was the result of a most successful co-operation with
Salford University. Polymer Latex materials account for some 20%
of the world's polymer production and there are, inevitably, a
range of compromises to be optimised - in this case a
cost-flexibility- thermal stability-barrier surface
 to be
explored. A range of polymers between vinyl chlorides and
acrylates called Haloflex which are used in many coating
applications from primers on blast clean steel to anti-fouling
coatings have been studied. Small angle scattering using the SRS
was used to investigate the size and geometry of the particles in
suspension. Using Bessel functions the analysis of monodisperse
systems has been effective, but the use of a coating material on
the particles giving a core plus shell model has proved mor
e of a
challenge. The Guinier approximation (which is valid for
Monodisperse and dilute dispersions) does not apply and the Porod
region is more suitable for a Haloflex which has around 50%
solids. At ILL, a cunning use of contrast matching using
D<sub>2</sub>O has helped reveal details of the system and the
studies on sphere size, and coalescence proved to be much more
exciting than watching paint dry! The four-region scheme that
Mike proposed, from the initial formation of monolayers to the
final
 coalescence of particles across surfactant bilayers was
confirmed using reflectivity measurements.</p>

<p>In this Industrial Group Session we were treated clear views
of complicated systems through the insight of sophisticated
techniques, careful analyses and well prepared speakers.</p>

<h2><a name="1188">1988 Autumn Meeting, ICI Runcorn</a></h2>

<p>This year's Autumn meeting of the BCA Industrial Group was
hosted by ICI C
hemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd at Runcorn in
Cheshire, on November 3rd, 1988. For the second year in
succession attendance was good (77 delegates in all) and the
Group was especially pleased to have the BCA president Prof.
Michael Woolfson in attendance. Alun Bowen (RAE, Farnborough)
acted as chairman in the absence of Brian Bellamy who was unable
to attend through illness.</p>

<p>The opening paper, traditionally by a representative of the
host establishment, was given by Dr. Steve Fletcher. Steve
d
escribed briefly the activities of the different industrial
sites of ICI Ltd, going on to talk in more detail about the uses
of powder diffraction at Runcorn. An interesting historical aside
was the fact that 'polythene' was first manufactured (and
characterised by XRD) at Runcorn in 1936. Powder diffraction was
currently used for the examination of fibres, thin films and
catalysts. Information such as crystallinity and chain
conformation was obtainable from fibre diffraction patterns
whilst crystal
lite size and strain in catalyst particles were
useful parameters in determining the activity and age of these
materials.</p>

<p>The second talk entitled "Use of combined databases in a
PC/CD-ROM environment" was given by Dr. Ron Jenkins of the
International Centre for Diffraction Data, U.S.A. Ron described
the three main databases which are commercially available from
JCPDS. PDF-2 which contains full card images, PDF-1 which holds
d's, I's, name and subfile designation, and CDF which contains
re
duced cell parameters, space group, calc. density, chemical
class, formula end name, and journal references. The same data
format was used in each database so the same search routines
could be used. A fourth database currently under construction is
PDF-3 which holds fully digitised powder patterns. CD-ROM was the
best medium for these large databases and the simplest, cheapest
system was an IBM 'XT' or 'AT' or clone with a 20Mb hard disk and
a 500Mb CD-ROM. On a semi-serious note, Ron said that the J
CPDS
were considering adding a 'jargon' file to the databases in order
to cope with Versions of the English language as used in the USA,
the UK, and at a pinch, that used in Australia!</p>

<p>The third talk concerned developments in powder diffraction at
the SRS, Daresbury. Dr. Bob Cernik spoke about progress in a
variety of experiments conducted at stations 9.1 and 9.3. The
introduction of a water-cooled Si monochromator designed by Mike
Hart had successfully overcome alignment and intensity prob
lems
with a 2-circle diffractometer. Good, high resolution data were
collected using a multiple foil c6llimator in the diffracted
beam. Changes in software were expected to improve peak-fitting
routines for patterns with narrow (0.030) peak widths. Diesel
fuels at low temperatures form waxy plate-like crystals and to
date five different forms had been indexed. EDXRD had been used
to examine the crystallinity of these waxy crystals as a function
of temperature and it had also been useful in following
 the
hydration process of tricalcium silicate in Portland cement.</p>

<p>Jo Jutson of the CEGB's Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories provided
the last talk before lunch. Carbon deposition on stainless steel
components of AGR's is a problem which causes reduced heat
transfer. Spinel oxide composition on the steel surfaces is known
to influence this deposition so oxides of the type (Mn, Cr, Fe
&amp; Ni) formed on the reactor components were synthesised in
CO<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>/CO atmospheres an
d characterised
by XRD and EDXRD. These spinels were then formed into ceramic
disks and exposed in a heated, gas-filled cell capsule to gamma
rays, in order to simulate reactor conditions. It was found that
Fe-Ni spinels deposited amorphous carbon, magnetite surfaces with
Ni particles produced carbon filaments, and Fe-Mn spinels
deposited both types.</p>

<p>Professor Mike Hart of the University of Manchester opened the
afternoon session with a thought-provoking talk on the use of
high energy X-ra
y diffraction. Mike described double crystal
diffraction experiments with 140-160kev X-rays. Low absorption,
the absence of extinction and the high Q values
(20-30A<sup>-1</sup>) obtainable were some of the advantages over
conventional Cu radiation. These advantages were of use to the
semiconductor industry in which measurement of rocking curves or
mosaic spreads of Si or Ge crystals had previously been
restricted to thin (&lt;lmm) specimens. Thicker specimens had
always required a neutron source. R
ocking curves of thick Si
crystals had now been measured at 0.2 sec. arc with 140 kev
X-rays. Mike concluded by promising even better prospects with
synchrotron radiation in this energy range as it would have a
brightness some 10,000 times greater at 150kev.</p>

<p>The sixth talk was a contribution by Dr. Tony Bell of UKAEA,
Springfields on Ruthenia in simulated vitrified nuclear waste.
RuO<sub>2</sub> has low solubility in the product glass and had
previously been thought to remain unchanged duri
ng the
vitrification process. However, determination of cell constants
of pure RuO<sub>2</sub> (a = 4.490, c = 3.105A), RuO<sub>2</sub>
in glass with waste oxides (a = 4.497, c = 3.082A), and
RuO<sub>2</sub> in glass with no waste oxides (a = 4.493, c =
3.103A) showed otherwise. Use of EPMA revealed that Fe and Mg had
been absorbed in the RuO<sub>2</sub> Lattice whilst Scanning
Electron Microscopy showed differences in the shape and size of
the crystallites in pure RuO<sub>2</sub> and those in the g
lass.
XRD also indicated strain in the needle-like glass-bound
RuO<sub>2</sub> while pure RuO<sub>2</sub> was strain-free and
had cubic morphology.</p>

<p>Jamshed Anwar of Birkbeck College presented the seventh talk
of the day entitled "Kinetics of phase transformations in drugs".
The kinetics of polymorphic transformations of the drug
sulphathiazole had been studied using powder diffraction and DSC.
The main objective was to achieve high accuracy in determining
the fraction transformed (<font fa
ce="Symbol">a</font> (t,T)) and
fortunately this was made easier in the quantitative calculations
as the four polymorphs have the same linear absorption
coefficient. Full diffraction pattern profile fitting was used,
taking into account changes in the unit cells of the different
phases occurring at elevated temperatures. The synchrotron source
(station 9.7 with EDXRD) at Daresbury had been used for some of
the work, enabling 1/20 sec. time resolution during phase
transformation.</p>

<p>The final 
talk on "Glancing angle EXAFS on condensed
interfaces" was given by Dr. Kevin Roberts of Strathclyde
University. Considerable interest had been shown in the
application of X-ray surface sensitive techniques to the
characterization of "real" surfaces using X-ray reflectivity and
EXAFS at glancing angles. For example, corrosion on the surface
of stainless steel blocks could be monitored by observing the
near edge structure (XANES) of bulk steel when the fingerprint of
steel transformed first into that
 of magnetite and then hematite
with the passage of time. Surface oxides on Gallium arsenide
wafers had been studied using EXAFS at the absorption edges of Ga
and As. Radial distribution functions showed a 20% increase in
Ga-O distances, a 120% increase in As-O distance and a 25%
decrease in As-Os distances ie. a net loss of As at the
surface.</p>

<p>The meeting was closed at 3.45 pm with thanks from the
chairman to all the speakers and especial thanks to Steve
Fletcher and his colleagues at the 
ICI Heath Site Conference
Centre for the excellent organization and hospitality.
Enraf-Nonius Ltd were also thanked for their generosity in
providing the conference folders and of course the liquid
refreshment at lunch time.</p>
