<h3>Phase Identification Modular Workshop.</h3>

<p>The modular structure and informal approach of the workshop
allowed conference delegates to come to the sessions that best
met their requirements. Between ~10 and ~30 people attended each
session. There was plenty of opportunity to question the experts
both during and after the presentations.</p>
<p>David Rendle, a volunteer editor with ICDD with years of
experience in the metropolitan police forensic science lab, led a
session on the History and Structure of the ICDD Powder
Diffraction File, from its inception very early in the history of
XRD, to the present. The first set of hand-written cards was
produced in 1941, with Set 3 in 1949 comprising ~2500 patterns.
Today, nearly half a million patterns are available on electronic
media, covering both experimental and calculated patterns.
Information is gathered from all over the world and carefully
reviewed before publication.</p>
<p>The session on Phase Identification was led by David Taylor,
currently ICDD volunteer treasurer and BCA IG web editor.
Considerations for good measurements were discussed (such as scan
parameters and instrument settings) and an understanding of the
instrumental errors and effects different properties of the
sample can have on the results, e.g. if it is textured or
stressed. Sample preparation methods to minimise induced texture
and stress were mentioned, and the usefulness of certified NIST
Standard Reference Materials for characterising the instrument
and providing an internal reference in a scan.</p>
<p>Building on David's introduction of the main methods for
identifying phases (alphabetic searches, Hanawalt, Fink and
Long8) John Faber of ICDD gave more detail in his Advanced
session, with explanation and discussion regarding quantification
of phases within a specimen. The importance of applying all
knowledge about a sample in order to obtain the most robust
conclusions was brought out, e.g. any information from other
measurement techniques, its physical properties (e.g. colour,
density) and its history. The use of reference scans,
concentration curves and internal standards are important for the
most precise analyses, together with thorough understanding of
instrumental and sample effects on the data, and at what level
these need to be taken into account. Gather good evidence and
argument in order to be sure of your conclusions. As ever, GIGO
applies.</p>
<p>The last workshop was a hands-on computer session with PDF4+,
DDView+ and SIeve+ software from ICDD. Many thanks to the IT
staff at Lancaster who prepared PCs in a suite so that each
delegate could use the software. This was valuable experience,
especially with expert guidance and the opportunity to ask
questions throughout. We were working through standard examples
which are usually used with a reduced PDF set. As such, some of
the matches came out differently from the text-book answers -
different card numbers for similar material. I was about to be
concerned about this, but different cards for the same type of
material can reflect for example the effects of different methods
of sample preparation or the data quality, and do not necessarily
mean that I've got the answer "wrong"!</p>

<p><strong>Alan Hewat (ILL)<sup>*</sup></strong> described the
<em>High Flux Neutron Diffractometers at ILL Grenoble.</em> The
ILL, a CCLRC laboratory, is open to all UK scientists provided
that the work they do is published. The following instruments at
the ILL are about to come on line again after an eight month
period of refurbishment. A call is presently out for new research
proposals before an August 2006 deadline. The following equipment
is available on the high flux beam lines from the ILL reactor:
SALSA <sup>(1)</sup>, a neutron strain scanner capable of
determining strains in industrial components weighing up to 0.5
tonne. Work on this is supported by the FaME38 industrial support
laboratory <sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
<p>The super-D2B detector <sup>(3)</sup> which yields very high
resolution neutron powder patterns in much less than an hour per
temperature step.The D20 high flux powder diffractometer
<sup>(4)</sup> which can collect complete diffraction patterns at
1-10 Hz thus enabling chemical kinetic studies to be carried out.
Its rate of data acquisition is comparable with a synchrotron.
The D20 can be used for example to examine ordering in metal
oxides, and the detailed structure of fullerene based structures.
Explosive reactions such as that between Ti, Si and C can also be
studied at 300msec intervals. Its furnace can reach 2200 degrees
Celsius, whilst 100kbar pressures can be applied during
experiments.</p>
<p>The new position sensitive detector on D19 <sup>(5)</sup>
greatly accelerates data collection on organic fibres and protein
single crystals. VIVALDI <sup>(6)</sup>, a neutron image plate
Laue camera can collect complete diffraction patterns from small
single crystals in 30 minutes. DRACULA <sup>(7)</sup> is an order
of magnitude faster than D20, and can be used similarly. CYCLOPS
<sup>(8)</sup> (CYlindrical Ccd Laue Optics Photo-Scintillator
will provide real time diffraction patterns covering 70% of 4pi
in sub-second read-out time. All these instruments are designed
to optimise the use of a continuous neutron source, and to
complement new machines on pulsed neutron sources e.g. IBIS,
which offer different advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Jupe (Georgia Institute of Technology,
USA)</strong> spoke on <em>In situ synchrotron diffraction for
studying oil well cement hydration at elevated temperatures and
pressures in real time.</em></p>
<p>He described the advantages of X-ray diffraction using a
synchrotron, and how he had applied them to the hydration of
Portland cements at both elevated temperatures and pressures. The
experimental conditions used were based on the environments
encountered in an oil well where Portland cement is used as a
grout between the bore of the oil well and its steel liner. The
cement mix is forced down the well using pressures of several
kilobars whilst the ambient (geothermal) temperature can reach
250 degrees Celsius. Five unambiguously identified Bragg
reflections at high d-spacings were used to monitor the evolution
of the five phases which occur in the final product cement. These
phases crystallise from the calcium hydroxide and amorphous
calcium silicate hydrate phases which are formed initially. It
was shown that the presence of tartaric acid appears to influence
the formation of aluminosilicate gels in the mixture; whilst
pressure had a strong influence on the beneficial formation of
tobermorayite which is formed when silica flour and zeolite are
added to the initial mix.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Thompson (Diamond Light Source Ltd)</strong>
gave an <em>Update on powder diffraction on Diamond.</em> This
facility is planned to be operational in August 2008. The high
flux available will enable high user throughput as well as very
high rates of data acquisition. Data will be collected using
X-rays with wavelengths between 0.4 and 2.5 Angstroms. The user
hutch will be 9m by 4m in size, with user and preparation
laboratories on hand. A double bounce X-ray mirror will be used,
with Si, Rh and Pt strips to avoid the presence of harmonics
in the beam. The size of the X-ray beam will be 15 X 2 mm at
5kV and 6 X 1 mm at 20kV. Particular design efforts have been
made to provide a user friendly facility, which will avoid the
need for the user to optimise the experimental conditions as well
as minimising the time spend on user  training.    </p>

<h3>Crystallisation and Polymorphism of Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<p align="center"><img height="361" alt="06cpoly (25K)" src=

<p>The <strong>Alun Bowen Lecture</strong> was given by <strong>Ulrich Griesser (University of Innsbruck)</strong>,
 who discussed polymorphism in drug development (more than half the drugs in the 
 European Pharmacopia) are listed as forming polymorphs or hydrates/solvates).  
 His lecture illustrated how thermal microscopy can be used to understand this 
 phenomenon and to determine the relationships between different forms. For 
 instance, solid-solid transformations can be readily detected in the hot-stage 
 microscope, but difficult to detect by DSC.  In addition, crystallisations on 
 the hot-stage microscope can be used to generate polymorphs which might be 
 difficult or even impossible to achieve via crystallisation:  this can be 
 done by sublimation from a heated microscope slide onto the cover slip and 
 by crystallisation from the melt followed by thermal cycling.  
</p>
<p>The session on <i>Crystallisation and Polymorphism of Pharmaceuticals</i> opened 
with <strong>Roger Davey (University of Manchester)</strong>, who considered nucleation from 
solution, and how it affects the outcome of crystallisation. There is a growing 
belief (based on computer simulation and some experimental evidence) that on 
nucleation an amorphous short-lived entity is formed.  In another case 
(tetrolic acid) there is a direct relationship between self-assembly in 
solution and the H-bonding motifs in the resulting crystals. He considered 
mandelic acid, and the formation of the racemic compound versus the formation 
of a conglomerate.  It was not possible to crystallise the conglomerate in 
preference to the compound from a racemic solution (even when seeded with the 
conglomerate).  But if the solution contained an enantiomeric excess, and 
suitable additives were used, then it was possible to achieve enantiomeric 
enrichment in the crystals.
</p>
<p><strong>Sally Price (UCL)</strong> talked about progress and problems in crystal structure 
prediction.  She described success in the prediction of the crystal structure 
of planar molecules, such as 3-oxauracil.  Difficulties arise when predicted 
energy landscapes have many polymorphs with very close energy minima, and also 
noted that kinetic factors might prevent nucleation or growth of some structures.  
A further difficulty arises from the fact that many compounds of practical 
interest, such as pharmaceuticals, are floppy and hence may adopt different 
conformations in different solid forms.  Combining crystal structure prediction 
with experimental work was used in an automated polymorph screen of 
carbamazepine: the six known forms were found, along with three solvates.  
However, a polymorph with a chain motif, that was predicted, was not found 
experimentally.  It was found that the polymorphic form was dependant on the 
crystallisation protocol rather than on the solvent.
</p>
<p><strong>Terry Threlfall (University of Southampton)</strong> gave a personal overview of 
crystallisation and polymorphism studies.  He advised that practical choices, 
such as container fabric, storage time, separation and drying regimes could 
all affect the polymorph obtained, as well as the more obvious variables.  
The chances of obtaining a novel form are maximised when crystallisation occurs 
in confined spaces, such as a capillary, hanging drop or emulsion, since the 
mother liquor is rapidly depleted once crystallisation occurs.  His cautionary 
tales included how a previously unknown but thermodynamically stable form of the 
drug Ritanovir, appeared once the drug was on the market.  The stable form was 
templated by the presence of an impurity, and its appearance required a total 
reformulation of the medicine to accommodate it.  Terry left us with one last 
thought: that in isolation, the least useful piece of information you can have 
about a polymorph is its crystal structure.
</p>
<p>The last talk was given by <strong>Caroline Day, of GSK,</strong> on polymorph screening by 
automated techniques.  Pharmaceutical companies need to make a suitable choice 
of solid form (i.e. the right salt and polymorph) fairly early in the development 
of a drug, so as to minimise the chances of nasty surprises and expensive changes 
later on.  However, in early development the quantity of drug available is quite 
low, and as development progresses, the proportion of drug candidates that fail 
(for instance, due to toxicity) is very high.  Caroline described how early 
development screens use automated crystallisation and analysis where possible; 
experimental variables include crystallisation method, solvent, temperature, 
supersaturation and slurries to identify the stable form.  In addition, the 
design of the crystallising vessel, including the choice of material, is very 
important in firstly maximising the chances of obtaining a solid, and then being 
able to analyse that solid <i>in-situ</i>, by XRPD and/or Raman.

<h3>Crystal Structure and Growth at the Nano-Scale</h3>
<p align="center"><img alt="06nano (14K)" src="photo/06nano.jpg" height="275" width="426"><br>
<small><b>Speakers</b> - Left to Right: Moti Lal, Richard Morris, Kevin Roberts, Klimentina Pencheva and Peter Laggner.</small></p>
<p> <strong><em>How Crystals Are Born: Novel Insight from Small-Angle Scattering.</em></strong><br>
<strong>Peter Laggner,</strong> Manfred Kriechbaum and Heinz Amenitsch<br>
<i>Institute of Biophysics and X-Ray Structure Research, Austrian Academy of Sciences
A-8042 Graz, Austria</i>  </p>


<p>In principle, the events that eventually lead to nucleation and growth of 
crystals from solutions or amorphous solids must involve density fluctuations 
at the nano-scale. This is the natural domain of small-angle scattering. The 
most general, direct observable is the specific inner surface, which is related 
to size and volume fraction of the fluctuations. The question is whether present 
X-ray techniques are sufficiently sensitive to detect the relevant pre-nucleation 
events. The lifetimes of these fluctuations are generally in the sub-microsecond 
range and their abundance at any instant, and the density differences between 
amorphous and nascent crystalline state, are extremely small. 
</p>
<p>Technical innovations in small-and wide-angle scattering, mainly concerning 
the brilliance of X-ray sources (synchrotrons), refined X-ray optics with low 
background, and efficient detectors have opened this field for new experiments. 
Basically, three types of experiments can be distinguished: (a) observation of 
the equilibrium fluctuations at p, t, c - conditions below the thermodynamic 
transition boundary, (b) steady-state, real-time observation of fluctuations 
during slow-scan conditions, and (c) rapid jump-relaxation experiments. While 
(a) and (b) can be performed with advanced laboratory X-ray equipment, (c) 
essentially requires the brilliance of synchrotron facilities. 
</p>
<p>Experiments were presented on crystallizing systems from solution, from 
amorphous solids, and from liquid-crystalline phase transitions. 
</p>
<p>In his first example of mechanisms of crystallisation, Peter described 
glycine where concentration fluctuations lead to liquid-like clusters, which 
lead to the formation of nuclei and growth. This was measured using time 
resolved SAXS experiments at the synchrotron facility at Trieste.
</p>
<p>The use of the Guinier Radius and Porod exponent to calculate the fractal 
dimension was described. The fractal dimension changes with time, RG changes 
from 3.4 - 4.2 &Aring; but there are doubts about its validity since the size 
scales are very small.
</p>

<p>In the laboratory, work on glycine using SWAX utilised experiments whereby 
solutions of glycine were pumped through a capillary and super-saturation was 
created by cooling. However, the results were disappointing as the interesting 
phenomena occurs at time spans shorter than 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>In his second experiment CdS and ZnS formation was monitored by SAXS but 
the size vs. time data did not fit the Oswald Ripening Equations (d3 vs. t).
</p>
<p>The third example discussed crystallisation from amorphous solids, 
specifically the transition from amorphous sucrose to crystalline sucrose - 
the SAXS intensity decreases due to the condensation of a porous solid to a 
dense solid, later WAXS intensity increases due to nucleation within the dense solid.
</p>
<p>Overall, the results demonstrated that SAXS/SWAXS is a powerful laboratory 
based analytical tool for the study of the mechanisms of crystallisation. 
However, depending on relaxation times, and hence the distance to equilibrium, 
these alternative approaches (SAXS/SWAXS vs. Synchrotron) could result in 
different data, i.e. the structural pathways to equilibrium can differ for the 
same initial and final states.    
</p>
<p><strong><em>Solution Phase Nucleation: Cluster Size and Shape and its 
Correlation with Kinetics and Polymorph Selection.</em><br>
Kevin Roberts </strong>University of Leeds.</p>
<p>Kevin introduced the importance of surface crystallography in nano-crystals. 
This is not usually considered, as one is usually looking at large crystals 
where surfaces are not important.
</p>
<p>It is essential to be able to predict crystal morphology and to do this Kevin 
described a software suite - POLYPACK that can define a polyhedron and pack it 
with molecules. With such a model one can predict crystallinity, RDF, geometric 
scaling and calculate equivalent diameters surface area and volume.
</p>
<p>Kevin presented examples of aspirin, glutamic acid - a and ß forms and 
d-mannitol and described the dependency of stability on size and nucleation 
rates vs. cluster sizes and asked the question; which polymorph do we want 
linked to nucleation?
</p>
<p>To decide this his team modelled small crystalline structures using XRD 
and the Polypack program.
</p>


 <p>Cluster energy calculations yield lattice minimisation values for e.g. 
 glutamic acid clusters 300-0 molecules. Crossover instability at ~50 molecules.
</p>
<p>Does this link to Oswald's Rule? Looking at spherical clusters - there is no 
crossover, the overall effect is due to shape and size, mannitol only crosses 
over when minimized and with benzophenone there is no cross over but convergence
</p>
<p>Does this mean that at small sizes all these clusters have essentially the 
same energies? Molecular confirmations become more restricted as clusters get 
larger.
</p>
<p>In conclusion; nano-cluster energies depend upon size.
Polymorph stability is influenced by structure and shape.
Small clusters have big spread of conformations.
Overall trying to understand crystallography of nano-crystals at the post 
nucleation stage of crystallisation.

<p><strong><em>Metal Nanocrystallites in Supercritical Fluids

</p>


<p>In investigating the effects of solvation and passivation on the equilibrium 
structure of metal nanoclusters dissolved in supercritical fluids, we have 
performed Molecular Dynamics simulations of bare and passivated 38-atom gold 
nanoparticle in ethane at several isotherms in the supercritical regime.  
The bare nanoparticle is found to be appreciably solvated with the solvation 
layer comprised of two regions: the inner region, located next to the cluster 
surface, making a dominant contribution to the degree of solvation, and the 
outer region making a relatively small contribution. The solvation gives rise 
to large distortion of the in-vacuum, minimum-energy, truncated octahedral 
structure of the particle, due essentially to the strong the solvent/metal atom 
interactions present in the solvated core.

<p>The mode of solvation of the passivated particle is one of loose dispersion 
of the solvating molecules in the passivating layer. The access of the solvent 
molecules to the core surface is now greatly reduced due to steric hindrance 
presented by the sulphur atoms chemically bond to the core. Here also the core 
structure suffers a very large deviation from the minimum-energy nanocrystalline 
structure, which may be ascribed to the extraneous stresses imposed on the core 
by the S-Au bonds as well as by the interchain interactions in the passivating

<p><strong><em>Quantifying Solubility Enhancement due to Particle Size Reduction 
and Crystal Habit Modification: Case Study of Acetyl Salicylic Acid.</em>
<br>Klimentina Pencheva, </strong> University of Leeds.</p>
<p>The poor solubility potential drug molecules is one of the major problems 
facing pharmaceutical scientists. It is well known, however, that the solubility 
of crystalline materials is enhanced with the reduction of particle size to sub 
micron levels.
</p>
<p>One of the problems with this reduction in particle size is the availability 
of interfacial tension data. This can be expected to vary with both solvent and 
crystal surface orientation (hkl). This study presented a quantitative approach 
to interfacial tension considering such factors as molecular and surface chemistry. 
</p>
<p>Surface molecular modelling was used to calculate the specific surface 
energies of different (hkl) faces of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) as a 
difference of the surface vacuum energy and surface solvent binding energy. 
The solvent binding energies were found using systematic search methods combined 
with solvent molecule docking on crystal surfaces.
</p>
<p>Using the modelled interfacial energies, the solubility enhancement as a 
function of the reduction of particle size was calculated as a function of 
growth morphologies for aspirin and solvent composition.

<p>The session started on time, after a short lunch.  <strong>Judith Shackleton</strong> (chair) 
introduced <strong>Jeremy Cockroft</strong> who gave a brief introduction and 
awarded the 
Industrial Group prize to <strong>Professor Paul Fewster</strong>, in recognition for his 
sustained contribution to industrial crystallography including crystallographic 
and diffraction work in industry of all kinds.  The award lecture was titled 
<i>It's all in the detail</i>.  Paul initially talked about his previous jobs 
and the instruments they had to use thirty years ago, and how the technology 
has moved on since.  A critical step had been interfacing of various pieces 
of apparatus to cheap PCs, "running in the face of management policy who 
preferred 'more standard' computer suppliers of the time". His work involved 
looking at superlattice structures, and the interfacial chemistry of Ga 
complexes.  The accuracies of the structures were then analysed using the 
dynamical theory and reciprocal space mapping to see whether the materials 
would be suitable to make superconductor devices.  These devices could be used 
as quantum dots (semiconductor nanocrystals) and then made into fibre optics 
for faster internet connections. Paul also included some work with a laboratory 
X-ray source on protein crystal perfection. He finished his talk with the 
analysis of polycrystalline thin film materials.
</p>
<p>The second speaker of the session was <strong>Dr. David Beveridge</strong>, and his talk was 
on <i>The precipitation of pigment red 57:1 from homogenous solution for X-ray 
powder diffraction</i>.  David described the synthesis that was involved in 
producing the pillar box red pigment. The morphological properties of the 
pigment looked more crystalline than expected.  So, with the help of powder 
diffraction, it was confirmed that the pigment was indeed crystalline.  
The red pigment is mainly used for colouring oil-soluble products such as 
Make-up, powders, lipsticks and foundation creams.  
</p>
<p>Before the session break, <strong>Dr. Mary Vickers</strong> gave a lecture on X<i>-ray 
diffraction at Materials Science, Cambridge</i>.  Mary talked about the 
typical samples that are analysed using powder diffraction such as metals, 
ceramics, and carbon nanotubes.  She mentioned the Rietvield refinement and 
the quantitative phase analyses and cell parameters in steel.  Mary has also 
carried out experiments using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) on thin film 
materials like polyurethane, which is medically important in replacing discs 
in the human spinal cord.  Staying on the topic, Mary highlighted the weakness 
of SAXS when it comes to identifying water molecules in cellulose fibres.  
The talk ended with a nice discussion on how students can be encouraged to 
learn more about X-ray diffraction.

<p><strong>After the break:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris Staddon </strong>- <i>University of Nottingham</i><br>

Chris started by giving an overview of the semiconductor material used in the 
electronic industry Si etc and the described the materials that were being used 
for development of commercial devices at Nottingham using mainly groups  
III&amp;V in the periodic table plus N and Mn ( for spintronics.)
Chris gave a very interesting presentation on ways in which XRD is used to 
categorise a variety of thin multi-layer semi-conductor materials that are 
being developed at Nottingham for commercial applications.
He described how these samples are grown by Molecular beam expitaxy (MBE)   
using high vacuum growth chambers in the  Physics Dept.</p>

<p>Examples were given of how the Crystal quality of the semi-conductors  
could be measured and how the fractions of hexagonal and cubic phases can be 
determined. 
For  ferromagnetic semiconductors where the Electron spin (magnetic properties) 
are important , Chris described how the Mn sustitutional concentration can be 
distinguished from the interstitials by measuring the Peak shift on annealing 
(lattice parameters changing due to diffusion of the interstitials)
</p>
<p>More sophisticated supperlatices were also described where a more complicated 
fringing pattern due to the multilayer interference was described.
The layer thicknesses and concentration of the components can be determined by 
modelling the diffraction pattern with commercial EPITAXY software.
Chris then finished by showing some recent results of Reciprocal space maps of 
InGaAs on GaAs where the layer is being used to strain the magnetic layer to 
produce a magnetic moment perpendicular to the plane for easier magnetic read 
write devices.
</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Hodge </strong>- <i>BP</i></p>

<p>Andrew explained about the development of XRD at BP and its applications in 
catalyst development, refining and marketing (engine deposits), and mineral 
semiquantitative analysis for exploration.</p>

<p>A potted background to BP was given as context to several moves of 
equipment, and Andrew is now the sole person performing XRD in BP.<br>
The best equipment is a new D8-TXS (rotating anode) and Vantec detector 
for super fast catalyst work. It is also interfaced with an In situ reaction 
cell using various reactive gases at temperature to mimic conditions inside 
chemical reactors. An old D5000 provides back up.

<p><strong>Martin Gill</strong>, <i>Imperial College</i></p>

<p>Martin gave us a nice slide show of his travels in India and also talked about 
the perils of not getting analysis before you stick your million quid black &amp; 
decker into the ground&hellip;&hellip;
