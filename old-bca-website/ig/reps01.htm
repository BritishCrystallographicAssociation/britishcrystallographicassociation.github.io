<h3>SM1 - New and Future Possibilitie
s in Powder Diffraction</h3>

<p>The second ICG symposium of the Reading Spring Meeting took
place on the morning of Tuesday April 10th in room 104 of the
Palmer Building. A very substantial number of people managed to
shake off the previous evening's revelries - that evening having
seen the Conference Dinner and an extension until 1am at the bar
- and attended the session, indeed filling the room to capacity
for much of the time. Chairing duties were ably fulfilled by
Steve Norval and Phil Holdway
, deputising for Chris Frampton who
was unable to attend for happy reasons.</p>

<p>The session's theme was designed to review recent developments
and look forward to near-future developments in a number of key
fields in powder diffraction. Three talks covered specific
application areas, with two more technology-based presentations
from diffractometer manufacturers to round off the morning.</p>

<p>The session was kicked off by Rob Delhez of Delft University,
with a talk on Line Broadening Analysi
s; Yesterday and Tomorrow.
Rob described a subject in a "transition state" - his title did
not contain the word "today". He described established methods of
size and strain analysis, such as the Warren-Averbach approach,
and how these have now been supplemented by methods for
accounting for the concentrations of different kinds of lattice
defects. However, so far there is little evidence for the
practical application of these methods to real materials
problems, although much theoretical work has bee
n published. Rob
made a plea for the rectification of this situation.</p>

<p>John Faber from ICDD (the International Centre for Diffraction
Data) described some recent and ongoing developments in the
Powder Diffraction File (PDF), which is very much a staple of
many powder diffractionists' work. There are now links with
structural database providers; the PDF is now growing rapidly,
replete with calculated patterns from the Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database and the Cambridge Structural Database.
 A new
relational structure to the database will also accompany the
launch of new, targeted subsets of the PDF, the first of which -
metals and alloys - is already available. John described some
examples of datamining using the new systems, including looking
at phases of the oxides of lanthanides, and determination of
atomic coordinates for beta-tantalum through examination of
isostructural compounds.</p>

<p>Jeremy Cockcroft (Birkbeck College) gave a splendid overview
of the broad subject of Riet
veld refinement. His description of
the subject's history pointed out the evolution of different
aspects of the topic, such as the kinds of radiation sources
used, the computing power applied, the peak shape parameters
applied, etc. Moving on to the present, he gave examples of the
kind of complex organic and organometallic compounds that are now
being refined by the Rietveld method (albeit with restraints and
constraints), sometimes having been determined ab initio from
powder data. There are now d
ynamic studies being carried out as a
function of temperature and pressure, and there is now even
application in structural molecular biology, with recent reports
of polypeptide structure refinements and refinement of the T3R3
human insulin zinc complex. Into the future, Jeremy posed some
tough questions - more structures will be solved and refined ab
initio with better data from better sources, but how can we weed
out the errors ? And exactly what information and/or data should
we archive ?</p>


<p>Technical presentations from Philips and Bruker AXS wound up
the session. Anna Widdowson from Philips described the
capabilities of their new X'Celerator system, which uses a new
detector technology called RTMS - "real time multiple strip".
Frank Stowasser of Bruker AXS described the many arrangements of
Goebel mirrors and beam expanders or compressors that can be used
to optimise beam optics for a range of different X-ray
diffraction applications.</p>

<p>So an entertaining and informative sess
ion came to an end at
lunchtime. Many thanks are due to all the speakers and to the
organisers for putting together such a worthwhile morning.</p>

<h3>SM2 - Why Industry uses Crystallography</h3>

<p><b>The Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture:</b><br>
<i>Crystallography in the Aerospace industry -</i> Colin Small
(Rolls Royce plc, Derby)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Crystallographi
c Section (Colin) at Rolls
Royce provides engineering answers from interpreted
crystallographic data - phase identification, texture analysis
(for titanium), residual stress in metallic materials - and any
service Colin is unable to provide himself, is obtained from
ISIS, Daresbury, various Universities and commercial
organizations. These answers are provided for engineering
colleagues who, although well qualified themselves, are
unfamiliar with aspects of crystallography such as texture
analysis a
nd pole figures.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Colin's talk began with an entertaining video
presentation of aero engine testing. Engines such as the Trent
890, fitted to the Boeing 777, undergo rigorous ground tests to
ensure that failure will never result in disintegration, rather
containment of any components within the engine body. To the
relief of the audience, especially those facing a return flight
across the Atlantic, the engine passed all tests (crosswinds,
icing, bombardment with hail, water, 2
.5lb chickens and 8lb
Canada geese) with flying colours!</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thermal paints are used to show (by colour
changes) the temperature to which certain parts of a jet engine
rise during operation. No really systematic attempt had been made
to establish a sound scientific basis for these colour changes.
So, one of Colin's first jobs was to analyse the ingredients of
the thermal paint, look at their high temperature chemistries,
and then analyse their reaction products, in order to expl
ain the
colours produced at high temperatures.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">One aircraft operating in the Middle East had
suffered engine failure during take-off. Subsequent investigation
revealed turbine blades coated in an orange-brown substance,
which had blocked the blades' cooling holes. Phase analysis of
the brown substance by XRD showed diopside
(CaMg(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), CaSO<sub>4</sub>, quartz,
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Analysis of
dust from the tarmac accou
nted for all these compounds except
diopside. Diopside had been formed from some of the other
compounds when they had struck the hot turbine blades. Reference
to the diopside phase diagram suggested that the engine's
operating temperature would cause the formation of solid diopside
which had then blocked the turbine blades' cooling holes, causing
overheating, resulting in engine failure. On the basis of this
work, advice was given to raise the engine's operating
temperature such that diopside would 
be present as a supercooled
<i>liquid</i> phase rather than as a solid. As a result, the
liquid diopside was blasted through the cooling holes and no
further blockages occurred. A superb piece of all-round
science!</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The underlying theme of this year's Alun Bowen
Lecture was really one of communication and education. Colin's
response to engineers' dislike of complicated information about
pole figures was to provide them initially with a simplified
scheme consisting of a sketc
h and 3 numbers. However, when a
titanium wide chord fan blade (WCFB) had failed a bird test, and
yet there appeared to be no changes in the chemistry and
microstructure of the blade, the texture was checked. A 0002 pole
figure revealed dramatic differences between the texture of the
failed blade and that of a normal blade and it was apparent that
on this occasion a simple explanation would not suffice. Some
change in the manufacturing process must have occurred, and to
convince the engineers, Colin
 supplemented a more detailed
explanation with some 3-D pictures of the pole figures. Further
investigation then revealed that in this particular forging
process, it had taken 5 minutes longer than normal to take the
ingot to the rolling mill and this time delay had caused the
texture change.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The lecture highlighted just how important it
is for a crystallographer (or any scientist for that matter) to
be able to translate his/her analytical results into meaningful
informatio
n for the customer who may then act upon it. The
examples quoted above illustrate the point admirably.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Pharmaceutical R&amp;D: Protein
Crystallography</i> - David Brown (Pfizer, Sandwich, Kent)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In today's approach to drug design, teams of
structural biologists are formed to develop screening methods and
to look for compounds that form the basis for effective
treatments for a disease. Compounds are made based on structural
information from computer
 modelling of the biochemical targets.
Thousands of compounds from existing compound libraries can be
screened by high speed robots (high throughput screening, HTS),
and those which show promising biological activity, called
"leads", are then optimised by chemical modification. If these
lead compounds pass early safety tests, they become development
candidates and move forward into the exploratory development
phase.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In terms of target molecules, the requirements
for structu
re-based drug design (SBDD) are: (a) a source of high
yield protein, (b) high purity proteins, (c) crystallisable
proteins, (d) high resolution diffraction patterns
&lt;2.5&Aring;, and (e) stability to solvents such as DMSO, MeOH
and EtOH. It is apparent that there is great value in data from
protein crystallography for understanding the modes of protein
binding in high throughput screening (HTS). There are currently
some 14,000 structures stored in the protein data bank and use is
made of virtual s
creening in which 3-D structures of target
protein and small molecules are screened for docking or
selectivity.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Pharmaceutical R&amp;D: How to make an
impact with small molecule crystallography</i> - Roy Copley
(GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Harlow, Essex)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Single crystal studies are used at all stages
of the Drug Discovery Process, for protein crystallography and
for the drug itself. They are used for molecular conformation and
absolute config
uration studies (NMR is used almost exclusively
for molecular connectivity) and are also used in conjunction with
powder diffraction, solid state NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy,
DSC and TGA for studies of bulk properties and polymorphism.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A particularly interesting example of the use
of crystallography concerned Augmentin, an oral antibacterial
containing sodium amoxycillin. It was important to see if the
crystals were solvated with methyl acetate, to determine why
methanol 
is needed for crystallisation, and to explain the powder
pattern. The space group was
P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> and the asymmetric unit
contained sodium amoxycillin, methyl acetate and methanol. The
sodium ions and solvent molecules lay in channels parallel to the
<i>a</i> axis, and methyl acetate did not bind to the Na ion.
However, the predicted powder pattern did not match that of the
bulk material. Another crystal was selected, and in this
structure there was no methanol, the meth
yl acetate molecule was
bound to the Na ion, but still the powder pattern did not match
the predicted one. A moment of inspiration resulted in the
production of a calculated powder pattern derived from a 2:1
mixture of the two crystal structures, which matched the
experimental pattern.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>X-ray diffraction in the Minerals
Industry</i> - Nick Elton (Exeter Advanced Technologies)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Analysis in the minerals industry is used in
all stages from exploration
 through extraction, comminution,
separation, blending, storage and transport. Chemical analysis is
done by wet chemistry and XRF, and phase analysis is undertaken
by XRD.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical problems arising with quantitative XRD
analysis are: (a) complex mixtures, (b) variable phases (solid
solution polymorphs), (c) poor crystallinity, (d) low
concentration, (e) preferred orientation, and (f) speed of
analysis. The cement industry is a prime example of where these
problems occur and 
they are compounded by lack of standards and
peak overlaps in the XRD patterns. The best approach would seem
to be Rietveld or whole pattern analysis. Sophisticated
approaches such as these are unheard of at the moment in the
minerals industry! XRD is usually only used for semi-quantitative
analysis in troubleshooting, but now some European plants are
using on-line XRD for clinker analysis. For on-line work, the
diffractometer is literally assembled at a suitable place in the
process. Phase analysis
 is achieved at both ambient and
non-ambient temperatures, and crystallite size distribution
(especially for the oil exploration industry) can be measured.
Another recent advance has been the prediction of 3 &amp; 28 day
compressive strength from XRD data using only 2 measurements from
the XRD pattern.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the aluminium industry too, bauxite
processing suffers from lack of good standards, variable
crystallinity and preferred orientation. As a consequence, the
XRD/XRF mass ba
lance approach is used. The conversion of
goethite-diaspore to haematite is related to the amount of Al
substitution, the solid solution obeying Vegard's Law. Preferred
orientation is solved by spray drying methods of sample
preparation. In the China Clay industry, quantification of
quartz, feldspar, kaolinite and mica is achieved through Peter
Salt's Quanticlay software.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">XRD will continue to be a key analysis tool in
terms of QA and QC, but a fast throughput is needed, beca
use as
is the case with all industries, cost reduction is essential.</p>

<h3><b>SM3 - Basic Powder Diffraction Workshop</b></h3>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Basic Powder Diffraction Workshop was made
up of three half-day sessions and was aimed at people relatively
new to the field of powder diffraction. Many graduates enter the
field of powder diffraction with very little knowledge of crystal
structure or how a diffractometer f
unctions. This workshop aimed
to correct those deficiencies. The first session provided a
well-balanced introduction to the principles of crystallography
relevant to an understanding of powder diffraction. In the second
session the X-ray diffractometer and sample preparation were
described and in the third session the problem of sample
identification was covered. Each of the Workshops sessions was
well attended.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Introduction to Crystallography</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY
">The speaker for this session was Jeremy
Cockcroft (Birkbeck College) who covered the crystallographic
principles underpinning powder diffraction. Topics discussed
included symmetry groups and crystal systems, space group
diagrams, factors affecting peak position, peak intensity and
line profiles in a powder diffraction pattern and reflection
multiplicity. The principles and practice of indexing reflections
by assigning hkl values to each diffraction peak, various
indexing methods, the choice of re
flections for indexing and
indexing problems were also covered. Other topics ranged from
unit cell refinement (including the need to take into account
zero errors and instrumental aberrations), space group
determination and whole pattern fitting. Finally Jeremy discussed
reflection conditions for the various crystal classes including
conditions for glide planes and screw axes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Powder Diffraction Instruments</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Judith Shackleton (Manchester Materi
al Science
Centre) started the second session with an introduction to the
production of monochromatic radiation, X-ray tube construction
and choice and the correct tube settings to use. This was
followed by a discussion on diffraction geometry, including the
Bragg-Brentano geometry which is generally used in powder
diffractometers. Other topics included the choice of filters and
monochromators to remove unwanted radiation and the use of Soller
slits and divergence slits and of primary and secondary 
optics in
general. Judith then talked about the sources of errors in powder
diffraction data. These included systematic errors such as
instrumental design and errors caused by the instrument being
incorrectly set up. Sample errors were also discussed and
included sample preparation, sample height, surface roughness,
particle statistics, transparency of sample, crystal size and
texture.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Phase Identification</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The speaker for this session was Joh
n Faber
(ICDD) who began with a brief history of the development of
powder diffraction data bases in qualitative analysis up to the
present day and the introduction of the more versatile Relational
Data Base (RDB). The ICDD powder diffraction file (PDF) currently
contains about 130,000 entries. John demonstrated the Boolean
search system and the Hanawalt and Fink search methods for
qualitative analysis and followed this with a discussion of fully
automated search methods, which are based on these. T
he latest
developments in automated search methods now include programs,
which have total pattern matching. Finally John demonstrated the
Relational Data Base (RDB) version of the PDF which gives a more
flexible search environment and allows easier updating of
information.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Pharmaceutical Special Interest Group Meeting
7th June 2001</h3>

<p>Morning Session:</p>

<p>The meeting was opened with the prese
ntation "Automated
Solutions to High Throughput Crystal Screening" by Paul Higginson
of Pfizer. Paul's presentation highlighted the cost that could
occur in the pharmaceutical industry should the wrong solid form
be taken into development. He highlighted the benefits of
automated screening, not just to the researcher who is relieved
of the monotony of repeated experiments, but also to the company
who can reduce the risk of an unwanted form appearing late in
development. Paul demonstrated the use of 
automated screening,
and the instrumentation involved, with a successful case study.
He concluded by emphasizing that a high quantity of data needs
high quality data management to produce usable knowledge.</p>

<p>"Prediction, Morphology and Mechanical Properties of
Paracetamol" was presented by Sally Price of UCL. Sally's
presentation demonstrated how difficult polymorph prediction can
be, but also highlighted some of the ways that may make polymorph
prediction more feasible in the future. She hig
hlighted how the
use of global minima in lattice energy would always be necessary,
but pointed out the high number of minima that normally occur
within a feasible range. She then went on to explain how you
could eliminate unlikely structures based on their morphologies.
For instance, crystal structures whose elastic constants mean
they would be too compressible to be realistic are unlikely to
form. In addition, crystal structures whose slowest growing face
is too slow are also unlikely to form. Sall
y concluded by
suggesting that involving nucleation kinetics may be the way
forward in this area.</p>

<p>Our hostess Clare Anderton gave the final talk of the morning
entitled "On-Line Monitoring of Solid-State Form during
Crystallisations by Raman Spectroscopy". Clare went on to explain
what Raman Spectroscopy is and how it works. She then highlighted
some of the advantages over methods such as XRPD, especially for
online monitoring. These included: high throughput, real time
investigation, mult
iplexing with more than one probe, portability
of the instrument and the sensitivity of Raman to solids forming
in solution. Clare then took us through two case studies to show
just how effective the method can be. The first case study showed
how the crystalline form could be monitored from the mid-point to
the end of a crystallisation procedure. The second case study
showed how the form of a product varied during the manufacturing
procedure, previously unseen by off-line measurements. Both case
stu
dies allowing quantification of forms to as little as 5-10%
<i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p align="RIGHT"><i>Brett Cooper, Merck Sharpe &amp;
Dohme</i></p>

<p><b>Afternoon Session:</b></p>

<p>The first presentation of the afternoon was by Dr. Arjen van
Langevelde of Crystallics on "High-Throughput XRPD in Polymorph
Discovery". Crystallics is a company which specialises in the
investigation of solid form pharmaceutical materials, in
particular polymorph identification, characterisation and
production.
</p>

<p>Polymorph identification is achieved through an automated
high-throughput crystallisation screen. Here concentration,
solvent composition, temperature, cooling gradients and ripening
time can be individually controlled to produce a wide range of
crystallisation condition thus maximising the chances of
discovering polymorphs. More than 1000 different crystallisation
experiments can be undertaken at one time, yet each
crystallisation takes place in 20 microlitre wells, minimising
the amount
 of material required. The resultant solids are
screened for crystallinity by an automated X-Ray Powder
Diffraction (XRPD) system, while proprietary software has been
developed for the interpretation of the XRPD patterns to allow
for fingerprint phase analysis through peak search and cross
correlation. Once identified, Crystallics can characterise these
polymorphs, off-line, by thermal analysis (DSC, TGA) and by
crystal structure determination, typically using Single Crystal
X-ray Diffraction. If ne
cessary, a 'MultiMax' reactor can be used
to optimise crystal growth conditions to produce suitable quality
single crystals. If only small, poorly diffracting crystals are
available the crystal structure can be determined from
high-resolution XRPD data. <i>Ab initio</i> structure prediction
is also offered as a means of structure determination. Finally,
once polymorphs have been identified and characterised, the
crystallisation conditions to optimise the production a specific
polymorph on scale up c
an be precisely determined using the
'MultiMax' reactor in batches up to 50 ml. This system is able to
automatically determine the meta-stable zone through solution
turbidity measurements. (Further information can be found at
http://www.crystallics.nl/)</p>

<p>Dr. Alastair Florence of the University of Strathclyde
continued the session with his presentation entitled 'DASHtastic
Adventures with the Bruker-D8'. Alastair related his recent
success in using the DASH program to solve molecular crystal

structures from Powder X-ray diffraction data collected on the
Bruker-D8 diffractometer. The diffractometer in his laboratory is
equipped with a primary monochromator to provide Cu
K<sub>A1</sub> radiation and a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD)
which enables the accurate location of reflection positions along
with good angular resolution and superior counting statistics.
This specification produces data with a quality that maximises
the chances of solving the structure. It is vital that the
effect
s of preferred orientation on intensities are removed from
the measured patterns and this is achieved by collecting data
using a rotating capillary geometry. To reduce absorption effects
borosilicate capillaries are used, while data is improved still
further by using a 1mm slit which reduces the background at no
cost to the measured intensities. Data analysis with DASH begins
with unit cell and space group determination. The peak positions
of the first 20 reflections are located using DASH and passed
 to
an input file for a third party indexing program such as
DICVOL-91. After indexing, a careful process of unit cell and
space group verification takes places by visual comparison of
predicted 'tick marks' <i>vs</i> observed peak positions. The
next stage is to perform a Pawley fit of the raw data which seeks
to model the pattern background, zero point, intensities, peak
widths and also refine the unit cell parameters. Typically data
is collected to 60<font face="Symbol">&deg;</font> 2 Theta but

the high angle data is often omitted from the fit due to a high
degree of peak overlap and poor signal-to-noise in this region.
After data processing, the business of solving the structure can
take place and this was described using Chlorpropamide as an
example. Initially a trial structure was generated by placing the
asymmetric unit at random within the unit cell. Comparison of the
simulated XRD pattern with the experimental one clearly
demonstrated that the structure was incorrect. A Simulated
Ann
ealing algorithm was then used to move the molecules about the
cell and vary torsion angles within the molecules to generate
more trial structures and minimise the difference between
simulated and experimental patterns. 300,000 structures were
tested to find the one that gave an excellent fit across the
whole pattern at which point the structure was considered to be
solved. The process took just 5 minutes!</p>

<p>The third presentation of the afternoon was by Detlef Beckers
of Phillips Analytical 
and was entitled "Temperature and Humidity
Controlled X-Ray Diffraction Analysis on 4-Epi-Oxytetracycline".
The ability to monitor structural changes of a material as a
function of temperature and relative humidity is of great
importance to pharmaceutical industry. An unexpected phase
transition at high temperature and high humidity during storage
or transport can turn a powerful medicine into a useless powder.
Phillips Analytical have developed a stage for the X'Pert Pro
Diffraction System where sa
mple chamber temperature and humidity
can be independently controlled. Humidity levels of 5% to 95% can
be achieved between room temperature and 50 <font face=
"Symbol">&deg;</font> C. An example of the use of the system was
described by reference to measurements on 4-epi-oxytetracycline
(OTC)<font color="#ff0000">.</font> OTC is a basic compound for
the production of various types of antibiotics, however it is
unstable under ambient conditions and can transform to 4-epi-OTC.
The level of the 4-epi-
OTC impurity must be controlled to be less
than 1% during production. HPLC is used to monitor the 4-epi-OTC
level but the system must first be calibrated against standards
of accurately known 4-epi-OTC content. In order to reproducibly
generate these standard samples, the environmental conditions
that govern the formation of 4-epi-OTC must be understood. Using
the X'Pert Pro system, three crystalline phases were found to be
associated with the formation of 4-epi-OTC and by recording PXRD
patterns as
 a function of temperature(5 <font face=
"Symbol">&deg;</font> C steps) and RH (5 % steps) it was possible
to construct a phase diagram relating all three of the phases.
Using this information the conditions required to generate
samples of precisely known 4-epi-OTC content could be
determined.</p>

<p>Chris Weston of Bruker AXS concluded the session with his
presentation on "X-Ray Rapid Screening System for Combinatorial
Chemistry". Combinatorial chemistry refers to techniques to
fabricate, test a
nd store the resulting data for a material
library containing tens, hundreds or even thousands different
materials or compounds. Combinatorial investigations require
rapid screening techniques to test and evaluate variations of
composition, structure and property within a material library.
X-ray diffraction is one of the most suitable screening
techniques for solids since it is fast and non-destructive and
abundant information can be revealed from the diffraction
pattern. A two-dimensional X-ray dif
fraction system designed for
rapid screening, D8 Discover GADDS for Combinatorial Screening,
has been developed for this purpose. The system consists of a
theta -theta vertical goniometer on which are housed X-ray tube
and optics, a two-dimensional X-ray detector, and an XYZ sample
stage plus laser/video for sample alignment and monitoring. This
geometry allows the combinatorial library of samples to be
mounted with ease. The two-dimensional multiwire detector can
collect a large area of a diffracti
on pattern with high speed,
high sensitivity, low noise and derives intensities by
integrating around the powder rings thus limiting the effects of
preferred orientation. The laser/video system ensures that each
sample is aligned accurately on the instrument center. Different
areas of a sample can be probed by the system since the X-ray
beam can be collimated from 1000 to 50 &micro;m. Once all the
data has been collected the GADDS software can be used to perform
the user specified screen. This could
 be phase identification
(qualitative and quantitative) or measurements such as degree of
crystallinity, particle size, texture or stress. To achieve this
a wide selection of screening parameters can be extracted from
the patterns such as integrated intensity, maximum intensity,
peak width, peak 2 theta position, crystallinity and various
stress components. The screening results can be displayed in
colour coded map, 3D surface plot, or pass/fail map with user
defined criteria.</p>

<h2>BCA Autumn Meeting Pilkington</h2>

<p>This year's meeting was held at Pilkington European Technical
Centre, Lancashire. Thirty-four people came. Jack Brettle, Head
of Science Support, welcomed us to Pilkington and opened the
meeting. He briefly described the scope of the company with
manufacturing plants in 25 different countries. Pilkington's
major achievement was the development of the process to make
float glass in the 1950s
. The business is divided into 2 main
lines, building and automotive products.</p>

<p>Most of us had an opportunity to view many products in the
Exhibition area which is fascinating. It describes how different
types of glass are made. Glass can be seen in a wide variety of
products from complex curved windows for helicopters and cars,
bullet proof glass, thermal control, optical systems and a
variety of ascetically pleasing products. We tested it
mechanically by using the glass stairs.</p>

<p>O
ur host and local organiser Mark Farnworth described the sort
of X-ray work carried out at Pilkington.  Powder diffraction is
used to check the quality of raw materials, identify the phases
in dusts and corrosion products and do troubleshooting on final
products. Many of Pilkington's special products are thin films
deposited on glass to improve thermal, optical or mechanical
properties. The XRD data can be made surface sensitive by coming
in at a glancing angle of 1 or 2 degrees which is useful. Fina
lly
these thin films make ideal samples for X-ray reflectometry (or
reflectivity). By calculating the data from models and comparing
these data with experimental data one can obtain information
about the film thickness, density and roughness. Mark showed data
from a Round Robin and the agreement was impressive.</p>

<p>The polymorphic form of a drug influences its stability,
solubility and hence bioavailability, thus powder diffraction is
an important tool for characterising pharmaceuticals as Anne

Kavanagh (Astra Zeneca) described.  Current regulations mean that
there is a requirement to check samples at all stages in their
lifecycle from discovery, though manufacture to trouble shooting.
Anne gave a few examples from the literature of polymorphs with
different physical properties and emphasised the importance of
using complementary techniques such as DSC, TGA and hot stage
optical microscopy. High temperature XRPD provides additional
information.  Mirrors and a position sensitive detector s
peed up
data collection and are beneficial for hot stage work. Astra
Zeneca also have a new system with a point source and a
2-dimensional position sensitive detector. This is ideal for very
small samples and could be used as a many small sample stage or
for spatially resolved work.</p>

<p>Matthias Abraham University of Oxford described how
nanocrystalline nickel can be made by electrodeposition. This
material is about 5 times harder than conventional large grained
nickel and thus has many potent
ial industrial applications.
However during wear local heating can cause grain growth which
reduces the hardness. Thus grain growth and hardness were studied
after heat treatments. Line broadening showed that just a few
grains grow and the rest remain roughly the same size and the
hardness remains high for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Keith Rogers' talk (Cranfield University) covered 3 distinct
topics. First he talked about his work on CdTe-CdS solar cells.
After describing these systems, Keith showe
d how diffraction
depth profiling had improved the understanding of the structural
changes than can occur in the anneal to make a CdTe-CdS
heterojunction. It appears that strain is the driving force for
recrystallisation. Next he talked about some of his colleagues'
work on bone. The challenge is to produce synthetic materials
that mimic human bone and can be used to repair breaks and make
implants. The effects of ageing and disease are also of great
interest. Human bone is poorly crystalline and th
us not well
defined.  We were shown some data from the nose of a whale which
was well crystalline and oriented and thus more information could
be obtained from it. With thermal treatment new crystalline
phases may be observed in bone. Keith showed that with increasing
temperature some peaks got sharper and the modulus increased.
Continuing the medical theme, the final topic was SAXS on breast
tissue with and without cancer. The results show that the
collagen in cancerous tissue is less ordered than 
that in healthy
tissue. One hospital is setting up SAXS equipment to investigate
the possibility of using this as a diagnostic test on biopsy
samples. Current tests usually involve staining and optical
microscopy.</p>

<p>INDUSTRIAL GROUP AWARD</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/ILAWD.jpg" width="400" height=
"300" alt="presentation of IG Award"></p>

<p>Chris Frampton, Chairman of the IG, presented Ian Langford
with the Industrial Group Award for his work on profil
e analysis.
Ian started working on powder diffraction in the early days with
Arthur Wilson at Cardiff. He has recently retired and now holds
an honorary position at Birmingham. He has published extensively
and in several of his papers data on zinc oxide were used as an
example to describe a particular method of analysis. Thus it was
appropriate that Ian chose to have a Beevers model of zinc oxide
for his award and then gave a talk on this material.</p>

<p>I had never realised that zinc oxide is us
ed so widely in
industry. Uses include: paint, ceramics, catalysts, lubricants,
paper, electronic devices, pharmaceuticals and even chemical
smoke. Most of these uses relate directly to its crystal
structure which has a hexagonal lattice and polar c axis. When
pure it is white and impure it is red hence its use as a pigment.
The crystallites are often submicron and anisotropic and thus can
be characterised by line broadening. Ian mentioned the early work
by Scherrer and Debye (1916, 1918) on line br
oadening, his
practical and widely used approach of defining peaks as partly
Gaussain and partly Lorenztian and working with integral breadths
and Scardi's approach for analysing size distributions. Looking
to the future, Ian said he thought that newer methods of analysis
would be based on building physical models and comparing
simulated and experimental data. This approach is widely used in
many other areas of X-ray scattering.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Most industries are currently in a state of change
 and Ilford
is no exception. David Beveridge's talk started with work
relating to silver halide photography and then moved onto the
challenges of trying to identify dyes and pigments in new inkjet
products. Many of these are poorly crystalline and can occur in
several polymorphs. The crystal structure can strongly influence
colour. Returning to the silver halides, their standard method of
analysis is to remove the gelatine and collect relatively high
angle data on the halide particles which have a c
ore shell
structure. Changes in the ratio of AgI to AgBr and line
broadening can be followed.</p>

<p>Ian Slipper talked about work done at University of Greenwich
for Sandberg Testing Laboratories. This involves running samples
of Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS) to determine its
glass content in accordance with BS6699. GGBS is a by-product of
the steel industry and it is sold on as an additive to cement. It
improves various properties of cement such as workability,
setting times, perm
eability and strength but these improvements
require that the material is predominately amorphous. The test
method discusses scan speeds, chart paper, separation of
crystalline and amorphous peaks then cutting and weighing the
paper to determine the amorphous content. Ian tried to update the
procedure using Bruker's software EVA. His experience showed that
some things which a person would do automatically require more
effort to make a computer program do the job.  After some initial
difficulties he 
was able to obtain comparable results by both
approaches.</p>

<p>Many industrial systems are messy and cannot be analysed by
classical line profile approaches. The lines are often
overlapped, backgrounds non-flat and for dynamic data there are
usually many data sets with poor counting statistics. Thus
neither analytical profile fitting nor Rietveld are suitable.
Steve Norval (ICI) described a new approach, LOSS, linear
optimisation of a simulated set. This involves simulating data
for a given pha
se, broadening the peaks with a single, or a range
of crystallite sizes, microstrain and/or stacking faults and then
convoluting this with a parameterised instrumental function. The
instrumental function can be checked by using the new NIST
lanthanum hexaboride standard. Steve pointed out that although
this standard is better than its predecessor it still has a bit
of microstrain and it should be stored under nitrogen. Both
experimental data and simulated data can be used as input to
LOSS. Steve dem
onstrated this pragmatic approach to analysing
real time data with an experimental set for the catalyst support
and simulated sets for Ni and NiO. Thus the appearance and
disappearance of phases during thermal treatment could be
followed.</p>

<p>This meeting was well attended (particularly considering that
Lathom is not one of the easiest places for most people to
reach). Several well-known faces who are now retired, or no
longer still working in diffraction, came and everyone appeared
to have en
joyed themselves. Credit for this is due to Judith
Shackleton, who put together a meeting which covered a wide range
of interesting industrial topics, and to all the speakers. Thanks
are also due to Mark Farnworth, the local organiser, for his work
and to Pilkington for allowing us to use their excellent
facilities.</p>
