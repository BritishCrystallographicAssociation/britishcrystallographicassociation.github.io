<h2><a name="Mar97">Powder Diffraction</a> and Computer
Simulation of Pharmaceutical Materials</h2>

<h2>held at Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, 19th March 1997.</h2>

<p>The meeting, which was attended by 70 people, was the first to
be held under the auspices of the Industrial Group of the British
Crystallographic Association. It was held to reflect the special
interests of the Pharmaceutical and Organic Industries and
follows a trial meeti
ng held a year earlier. The meeting was
opened by <strong>Dr Steve Norval</strong> of the BCA who
elaborated on the aims of the association.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Hammond (Heriot Watt University) then discussed a
procedure for generating trial structures by systematically
searching phase space, the possible packing arrangements being
ranked on the basis of atom-atom interactions. The methodology
was employed as an aid to determine the crystal structure from
high resolution powder diffraction data for 
a number of
speciality materials. In the future the hope is to extend these
studies to include conformationally flexible systems.</p>

<p>Prof. Kenneth Harris (University of Birmingham) then continued
the theme of solving crystal structures from powder diffraction
data. Prof. Harris discussed a novel approach based on a Monte
Carlo technique. In this approach a structural fragment is moved
around the unit cell using a Metropolis type algorithm and the
powder diffraction pattern is calculated for ea
ch configuration.
The agreement between the calculated structural models and the
experimental data is assessed using the profile R factor. During
question time the relative merits of the systematic sampling
approach and the Monte Carlo based technique were discussed.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank Leusin (Molecular Simulation Inc) spoke on the
approach used by the Cerius 2 polymorph prediction software. The
software uses an ab-initio approach to produce tens of thousands
of possible structures which are screene
d for duplicates and
clustered to yield unique structures. The trial structures are
normally restricted to the 17 most common space groups that
account for about 95% of known structures. Molecular Simulations
Inc intend to invite Pharmaceutical companies to join a
Pharmaceutical Development Consortium to pursue the development
and application of such computational methods on molecules of
pharmaceutical interest, including flexible and ionic molecules.
Dr Robin Payne (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals), a user 
of the Cerius 2
polymorph predictor, then expanded on the use of the software
within Zeneca. He gave a critical appraisal of the capabilities
of software when it was used for molecules of varying complexity.
It appears that the current forcefields still have important
limitations, and that application to flexible molecules can be
challenging.</p>

<p>Prof. Roger Davey (UMIST) explained his current area of
research namely the use of graph sets in the discrimination of
hydrogen bonded polymorphic st
ructures. Using sulphathiozole as a
model compound he explained how the solvent might interact with
the faces of developing crystals to selectively yield a
particular polymorph.</p>

<p>The afternoon section opened with Dr Simon Clarke (Daresbury
Laboratory) who introduced Daresbury Laboratory and highlighted
advantages of the synchrotron source offer over conventional
laboratory equipment. These derive from the bright collimated
nature of synchrotron radiation. In particular, high quality,
high r
esolution powder diffraction data can be collected. Such
data enable more reliable indexing and structure elucidation.</p>

<p>Dr Jamshed Anwar (King's College London) then presented
results of computer simulation of the crystallisation process
starting from discreet solvent and solute units. The simulations
increase our understanding of the crystallisation process and may
lead to the development of designer molecules that may be used to
selectively crystallise a particular polymorph.</p>

<p>Dr.D
erk Reefman (Philips Research) introduced a new software
product that should enable more accurate assays of mixtures whose
components have different mass absorption coefficients and are
susceptible to texture effects. The method is based on total
pattern fitting methodology and does not require structural
information associated with Rietveld refinement methods.</p>

<p>Dr.Steve Norval (ICI) spoke on NAMAS and the XRD laboratory
and the future introduction of European standards. Current NIST
standar
ds include mica for low angle calibration, silicon and
alumina which has the advantage of being supplied as a solid
plate.</p>

<p>Dr Steve Maginn (Daresbury Materials Characterisation Service)
elaborated on the new Daresbury Laboratory service that has been
set up in response to the needs of industrial users. In
particular, station 9.8 is able to provide a complete single
crystal solution for an organic compound for approximately
&pound;4000 using crystals as small as 5x50x50mm. Additionally,
sta
tion 2.3 allows the collection of high quality powder
diffraction data suitable for Reidveld refinement at a cost of
approximately &pound;1500.</p>

<p>Finally Sue Staniforth (GlaxoWellcome) gave a presentation
demonstrating the complex inter-relationship that can exist
between polymorphic and pseudopolymorphic forms of an organic
compound. Of particular interest was the fact that three
polymorphic sesqui hydrates exist for the compound examined. This
was followed by Robin Shirley (Sussex) who prov
ided a brief
update on indexing and the type of data that yields accurate
solutions.</p>

<p>The BCA would like to thank Molecular Simulation Inc.for
supporting the meeting.</p>

<h2><a name="Apr97s1">Session 1</a> - Process and Production
Applications</h2>

<h3>Spring Meeting, Leeds 1997</h3>

Reinhard Beilmann (Hermann Milke, Germany) described the chemical
and physical processes of cements producti
on; the burning of +raw
meal+ to clinker and on through to the final commercial product.
The role of QC in the process was outlined and the successful
development of automated sampling systems for XRD analysis
discussed. Examples of mineral composition, free lime and CO2
(CaCO3) determinations by quantitative XRD were given. The
automated techniques in each case provided at least a ten-fold
decrease in analysis time compared to the classical chemical
previously employed.

<p>Mary Halliwell (Philip
s, Almelo) reported on the use of
specialised XRD techniques as a QC tool in the fabrication of
semi-conductor based optoelectronic devices. The fabrication
process was described and emphasis was placed on the need for
precise control of layer thickness and layer composition. The
economic viability of the process is dependent on the success of
the heteroexptixal growth of ternary and quaternary Indium
phosphide alloys and it is here that XRD has proved itself an
essential QC tool. Precise monitoring
 of the process at each
stage can be achieved by wafer mapping procedures using dense or
sparse grids, utilising either double crystal diffractometers or
four reflection monochromators. Compositional and mismatch
mapping techniques were described and examples of their use
given.</p>

<p>Colin Small (Rolls Royce, Derby) expanded on the need for and
techniques of texture measurement in the composition of modern
wide chord fan blades as used in the RB211 and Trent 800
aero-engines. After a brief hist
ory of the fan blade product
development from carbon fibre to chemically hollowed
titanium-honeycomb composites the hexagonal and cubic symmetry of
the modern product+s texture and its analysis was discussed. The
use of pole figures and the success achieved in fingerprinting
the production process was highlighted. The talk will long be
remembered for its stage props, the concept of Rolls Royce
engineers simulating bird strikes and the lengthy acronym SPFPB
WCFB.</p>

<p>Christopher Frampton (Roche
, Welwyn) discussed the subject of
polymorphism and phase analysis outlining its importance in the
pharmaceutical development sector. With the different physical
properties exhibited by polymorphism of the same molecule the
need for an appreciation of their formation and detection was
emphasised and solubility, dissolution rates, hygroscopicity, and
stability were highlighted as properties that require strict
control in the formulation of drug delivery systems. The XRD
analysis of 1-Hydroxy-7-azaben
zotriazole utilising powder and
single crystal methods (SMART CCD), in concert with thermal
analysis and solid state NMR, was demonstrated and the two forms
of H-bonded crystalline lattice, C2/c and P21/c, were shown.</p>

<h2><a name="Apr97s2">Session 2</a> X-Ray Diffraction plus ...
Simultaneous Methods</h2>

The Industrial Group Plenary Lecture, the first Alun Bowen
Industrial Lecture entitled &
iexcl;Cine Crystallography
Plus&cent; was presented by Prof. Paul Barnes, (Industrial
Materials Group, Birkbeck College, London). The presentation
resembled your local multiplex cinema with at least four
concurrent screens to follow his chosen examples. The lecture
concentrated on time dependent observations using more than one
structural probe on functional materials with immediate
commercial applications. XRD in combination with
synchrotron/neutron diffraction or scattering and computer
graphic m
odelling have all been utilised.

<p>The formation of crystalline ceramics represented by zirconia
was illustrated as the first example of the lecture. On heating
from ambient to 1300 C changes in the structure from a 2
dimensional amorphous hydroxy precursor to a three dimensional
crystalline oxide were followed by this multi technique approach.
Key steps identified using this combination of techniques include
the initial loss of peripheral waters followed by amorphous oxide
hydroxide &iexcl;rafts
&cent; are believed to condense together.
Oxidation of the amorphous material to form metastable
8-coordinate tetragonal zirconia then occurs. On cooling from
1300 C, 7-coordinate monoclinic zirconia is formed.</p>

<p>By a similar methodology the hydration of cements has been
studied. An intermediate phase not previously detected due to
&iexcl;time smearing&cent; has been identified. This is important
as in large concrete structures, such as bridges, temperatures of
70 -80 C can be attained from e
xothermic reactions during
building.</p>

<p>A video presentation of computer modelling of methane/nitrogen
separation in K substituted Ca- Clinoptilolite was the final
example of the lecture. Potassium is shown to act as a
&iexcl;double cation valve&cent; for selective adsorption within
the main zeolite channel. Prof. Barnes finished the lecture with
a few reminisce of Alun Bowen, the &iexcl;Professor of Preferred
Orientation&cent;, who had the ability to explain the complex
subject of texture/ o
rientation clearly to anyone.</p>

<p>The following Industrial Group Session was chaired by Craig
Adam. Helen Gleeson, (University of Manchester) spoke on
&iexcl;Simultaneous X-Ray and Raman scattering studies of liquid
crystals&cent;. At Daresbury small and wide angle scattering has
been undertaken concurrently with Raman spectroscopy. Response
times for optical and X-Rays have been measured for various
devices and new liquid crystalline compounds from simultaneous
experiments.</p>

<p>Ian Hanle
y, (University of Leeds) spoke on &iexcl;Correlating
material properties of polymers with structure: a new rheometer
for X-ray scattering studies&cent;. A Rheometrics RSAII rheometer
has been modified to allow the passage of X-Rays for small angle
scattering experiments at the SRS, Daresbury. Copolymer gels such
as polyoxyethylene and polyoxobutylene form micelles. Shear
induced ordering of copolymer melts is found: Bragg peaks are
found to correlate with rheological properties.</p>

<p>Tony Ryan, 
(UMIST) lectured on &iexcl;Structure Development
During Polymer Film Extrusion&cent;. Whereas the growth of
polymer crystals is well understood, the understanding of the
nucleation process is less clear. Dr Ryan lectured on rapid
crystallisations by melt extrusion of a tape on a synchrotron
beamline with SAXS/WAXS area detectors. This steady state
arrangement allows for long data collection times for short
crystallisation processes. The conclusions are that the
nucleation event in homopolymers is a 
spinodal decomposition of
chain segments.</p>

<h2><a name="Jun97">Report</a> on the Industrial Group
Workshop</h2>

<h2>Diffraction at Elevated Temperatures</h2>

<h2>held at Pilkingtons, Lathom June 4th 1997</h2>

<p>David Taylor organised this one day workshop which was hosted
at Pilkington Technology Centre and attended by over 30
participants.</p>

<p>David Taylor (Pilkin
gton plc) opened the round table event
with an overview of the technique. He mentioned that while other
complementary techniques such as TGA(Thermo Gravimetric Analysis)
or DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis) identify a temperature at
which a change occurs, it is usually only X-ray diffraction that
can identify the reaction occurring.</p>

<p>Steve Norval (ICI, Wilton) continued with an overview of
commercially available hardware. He compared and contrasted
respective manufacturers approaches to th
e major problems
encountered with any heating design of thermal gradients and
alignment. He described furnaces and reaction chambers of various
specifications including high pressure (to 60 bar), and high
temperature (to 2,400 C) variants.</p>

<p>With the formal session now completed, a more informal round
table session developed. Participants brought overheads to
describe their own hardware/software, adaptations and
applications. Simon Redfern (University of Cambridge) described
his in-house des
igned horseshoe heater. He also passed on the
handy tip that under vacuum conditions peak widths can be up to
50% larger due to pump vibrations.</p>

<p>Paul Rainsford (Zeneca) described his in-house heating stage.
It cost only &pound;1,500 to design and build and readily fits
into a standard sample holder position on a Siemens
diffractometer. For temperatures of up to 200 C
hydration/dehydration studies and melt/recrystallisations have
been readily studied. V. Ruddick (BNFL Springfields) introduce
d
work done using a PSD and HTK 600 at BNFL. Tim Hyde (Johnson
Matthey) talked about the crystallisation of zirconias using
HTK10 equipment. Different commercial suppliers of the same
zirconia precursors were found to give differing crystallization
temperatures on formation of crystalline zirconia, an effect
which was found to correlate with overall commercial product
durability.</p>

<p>The afternoon workshop session then considered methods to
maximise intensity. Simple solutions such as the remo
val of the
secondary soller slit which usually leads to a doubling of count
rate, together with more costly solutions such as installation of
a focusing mirror were discussed.</p>

<p>The second main topic reviewed was temperature validation. It
has been established that up to a 200 C variation in temperature
between top and bottom surfaces and 30 C variation across the
surface of a ribbon heater can exist. Calibration
materials/methods brought significant contributions as attendees
gave details o
f specific standards they employ. Materials of high
thermal coefficient of expansion such as aluminum enable one
standard to calibrate a wide temperature range.</p>

<p>The meeting closed with some more general topics such as
specimen preparation, sample holders, liquids, internal standards
and tips for beginners were covered.</p>

<h1>Report on Industrial Group Autumn Meeting 1997</h1>

<p>The Industrial Group's Autumn 
Meeting took place on 6th
November in the pleasant surroundings of the Whitworth Conference
Centre at Cranfield University, Shrivenham, Swindon with an
attendance of over 50. The meeting opened with a welcome by the
Vice Principal, Professor A Brown, who outlined the role of the
establishment as a services university.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Langford</strong> (Birmingham University) gave the
first paper entitled <strong>An Historical Perspective of X-ray
Powder Crystallography</strong>. This embraced t
he foundations by
Debye and Scherrer in Europe and Hull in the USA, through
milestones such as the data base by Hanawalt et al which led to
the PDF, the Guinier camera, the introduction of the
diffractometer by Parrish, the various theoretical developments
by Bertaut, Guinier, Warren and Wilson and the Rietveld
method.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Hall</strong> (Schlumberger Cambridge Research)
then described a technique using synchrotron source with an
energy dispersive diffractometer and a very finely 
collimated
beam. Diffraction occurs from a volume of a few microns cube
which can be located inside a large sample. He showed how, by
scanning the sample composition profiles can be obtained in
rocks, concrete, clays etc with spatial resolutions of better
than 10 microns.</p>

<p>Under the heading <strong>Pole Figures Explained</strong>,
<strong>Jo Jutson</strong> (BICC Cables) offered a simple way of
understanding pole figures. She used a variety of models to
explain how data was collected and a 
pole figure plotted. She
then gave each of us an indexed celluloid cube and a pole figure
so that we could each learn how to interpret it. <strong>Kath
Clay</strong> (Hexmat) then extended the discussion to the
hexagonal system with examples of results from a variety of
materials.</p>

<p>As an alternative to XRD pole figures, <strong>H S
Uhbi</strong> (DRA-Farnborough) then described how an electron
backscattered diffraction pattern can be obtained in a scanning
electron microscope. This can be a
nalysed by an on-line computer
to produce orientation data grain by grain. Results compare well
with X-ray pole figures but it is also possible to assess
variations across a cross section.</p>

<p>After lunch <strong>Steve Norval</strong> (ICI) outlined the
<strong>European X-ray Powder Diffraction
Standardization</strong> project, for which he is the UK
representative. The main items covered are - Terminology, General
Principles, Procedures, Samples and Instrumentation. It is
expected to be compl
eted in early 1999 and would then become the
basis for laboratory accreditation.</p>

<p>The second <strong>Chris Hall</strong> of the day, (SRS
Daresbury) then talked about <strong>The Potential of X-ray
Diffraction within the National Health Service</strong>. He
outlined some applications including phases in renal and
gall bladder stones. Measurements on calciferous deposits and
samples of breast tissue show possibilities of identifying
precancerous stages. Preferred orientation measurement has a
 role
in corneal grafts as correct orientation is essential for
success. Chris concluded with a vision of a diffractometer in
every hospital.</p>

<p>A new Industrial Group venture was a session <strong>My
Problem- What solution</strong> in which all present were
invited to submit their problems in the hope that the collected
wisdom would provide some answers. Topics raised included low
angle measurements, texture from powder patterns, non-uniform
strain from line broadening, thin films, pyrophori
c nickel and
microtoming of polymers.</p>

<p>In what was possibly the first time that the President of the
BCA had addressed an IG meeting, <strong>Mike Glazer</strong>
(Oxford University) made a cautious attempt to predict future
developments in XRD. As well as the obvious advances in
computers, he considered that developments in detectors and
environmental stages were overdue. He then discussed some of the
latest experiments which push the technique to its limits such a
high power laser sources
 which produce diffraction patterns in
picoseconds and also improved X-ray sources.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meeting thanks were offered to the
local team, led by Keith Rogers, for their successful
organisation.</p>
