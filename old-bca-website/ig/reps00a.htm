<h1>BCA IG Autumn Meeting</h1>

<h2>Crystallography in Industry</h2>

<h3>2<sup>nd</sup> November 2000, Welwyn</h3>

<p><b>Morning Session</b></p>

<p>Brett Cooper (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme) opened the meeting with
a case study showing how powder diffraction,
 although not often
the technique of choice, can be used as a quantitative tool for
monitoring polymorphic conversion in both drug substance and
product. He discussed the inherent problems of powder diffraction
for this application, such as preferred orientation, and how this
had been approached. He concluded with an insight into the
thermodynamic relationship between the two forms, and evidence
suggesting that the conversion arose from recrystallisation in
the presence of water rather than a solid-
state transition.</p>

<p>Progress in indexing powder diffraction patterns was presented
by Robin Shirley (University of Surrey). This included an
introduction to why indexing can be difficult and a comprehensive
survey of the algorithms available and their relative strengths
and weaknesses, and an update on the progress of Industrial
CrysFire. He concluded with a demonstration of CrysFire.</p>

<p>Chris Frampton (Roche Pharmaceuticals) presented recent
zopiclone results as an update to his presen
tation at the Spring
Meeting. This included elucidation of the crystal structure of
the anhydrous monoclinic form from synchrotron powder data,
enabling comparison with the previously obtained single crystal
structures of the monoclinic dihydrate and orthorhombic
anhydrate. Comparison of the two monoclinic forms clearly
demonstrated the dramatic changes that can result from ingress of
water into channels in the structure. The changes in inversion
symmetry for the anhydrous forms suggest that there m
ay be a
racemic to enantiomeric transition.</p>

<p>The BCA representative to ICDD, David Taylor, described the
role of the<br>
ICDD and how its membership is made up. He then gave a report on
recent<br>
developments within ICDD. These included the move away from paper
products<br>
to a range of Relational Database CD-ROM's thus reducing costs,
electronic<br>
purchasing, workshops and conferences, and new licences.</p>

<p><b>Af
ternoon Session:</b></p>

<p>Following lunch, provided by Roche Discovery, the afternoon
session opened with Dr Steve Norval who presented the Industrial
Group Award to <a href="#award00">Dr David Dyson</a> for his
contribution to the field of X-ray diffraction. The Industrial
Group Award Lecture which followed gave an fascinating insight
into the life of a practitioner of X-ray diffraction over the
years with an emphasis on the measurement of texture.</p>

<p>Steve Norval (ICI) then provided an u
pdate on the progress
towards the release of an EU Standard covering X-ray diffraction.
A standard is required as there is currently no National or
International point of reference to encourage good practice, and
to act as a point of reference. The General Principles section
will be the first part to be released; possibly this year. Its
release will impact on all uses of X-ray equipment working in a
regulated arena.</p>

<p>Judith Shackleton (Manchester Materials Science Centre)
provided a report 
on the Structural Materials Workshop held
earlier in the year. The workshop was seen as a big success in
bringing together people who work in this field and covered the
pros and cons of sample preparation techniques. Finishing, Judith
made a request for ideas to be made for future meetings.</p>

<p>Dr Liz Town-Andrews (DARTS) reported on the workshop held in
October to communicate their objectives to industry. Liz related
that a lot had been done to make the facility much more
accessible to industr
y and that they now able to offer a service
based on a charge per sample or problem. An example of this
service is afforded by station 9.8, which deals with micro
diffraction. They will now, on the basis of no success no charge,
attempt to solve the crystal structure from very small crystals
(&gt;20<font face="Symbol">m</font> m in all dimensions); the
cost of success &pound;4000.</p>

<p>Paul Tattersall (NRPB) gave an update on the impact of IRR-99
which became effective from 13<sup>th</sup> May 2
000.</p>

<p>The legislation covers employers intending to use electrical
equipment to produce X-rays for industrial radiography,
processing of products, research and finally exposure of persons
for medical treatment accelerators (except electron
microscopes).</p>

<p>The regulation covers Prior Authorisation, Notification of
Work, Prior Risk Assessment, Restriction of Exposure, Engineering
Controls, Dose Limitations and Contingency Plans.</p>

Norval</p>

<p>David Dyson was presented with an Industrial Group Award
during the 2000 Autumn Meeting at Roche Discovery, Welwyn. David
has been associated with BCA Industrial Group from its inception.
He has contributed widely to group activities and served on the
committee as
 an ordinary member, vice-chair and chair between
1989 and 1996.</p>

<p>David's involvement with crystalline materials and industry
began when he joined G.E.C from university, characterising
reactor graphite materials. That developed an interest in high
temperature studies, crystallite size and strain using camera and
diffractometer methods.</p>

<p>18 months later, David returned to his native Yorkshire to
work with United Steel Companies, which later became British
Steel. This brought together
 interests in electron and x-ray
diffraction that David has pursued ever since. Early studies
covered phase analysis in oxide systems that led to the
identification of a number of new phases appearing in the powder
diffraction file. In the 60s, he developed the diffractometer
method for analysing dust on air filters and contributed to the
MDHS standard used since for environmental monitoring.</p>

<p>David was one of the first people in industry to recognise the
importance of computers in the XRD l
aboratory for data collection
and analysis. A large suite of programs followed covering a
variety of aspects of his work. He developed means for the
quantitative analysis of a number of products in the steel
industry and contributed to development of profile fitting
methods. He became very interested in the effects of solid
solution and preferred orientation, both of which are common in
the steel industry. David has also contributed to British
Standards in Texture Analysis of steels. He was responsi
ble for
setting up the BS in the early 70s and developed the software.
The use of ODF saw him talking to and advising suppliers on how
to output the data.</p>

<p>There was a series of BS reports on electron diffraction that
subsequently appeared as a book - still selling world wide (He
says it needs updating and re-issuing!) This introduced him to
single crystal work and geometry of diffraction with the
stereographic projection became one of his most useful tools.
Installation of a 1000KV HVEM at
 Rotherham enabled him to study
phase transformations and orientation changes in situ during
straining and at high temperatures via diffraction studies.</p>

<p>An area of David's activity that has become very familiar in
recent years is his strong interest in quality assurance,
especially in relation to NAMAS / UKAS. Several of us have
benefited from his regular and thorough assessment visits!</p>

<p>There are inevitably many important things missed here from
David's many contributions to indust
rial crystallography. He has
published well over 100 papers and given many lectures both at
home and abroad. But I hope it will be very clear that David is a
very worthy a recipient of this award.</p>
