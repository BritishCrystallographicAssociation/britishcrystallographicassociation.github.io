<h3>Workshop - Introduction to T
hin Films</h3>

<p align="CENTER">09:00 - 10:30 26<sup>th</sup> March 2002</p>

<p>The tutorial is designed to give a basic introduction to the
analysis of thin films. This method is often referred to as
"Glancing Incidence X-Ray Analysis (GIXA)" or reflectometry. It
is used to determine the thickness, roughness, density etc of
layers, which are less than (about) a micron in thickness.
Typical examples are layers deposited to form electronic devices
and also optical coatings on glass.</p>

<p>Th
e tutorial will be divided into three sessions. Firstly,
<b>Professor Paul Fewster, Philips Research,</b> will introduce
some of the physics behind reflectometry. Next, the practical
aspects of aligning the sample, collecting and analysing the data
will be discussed by <b>Dr Christoph Schug (IBM SSD Mainz,
Germany).</b> Finally, we will describe some practical
examples.</p>

<p>This workshop is designed for the beginner as well as those
who have some experience of the technique. There will be time 
to
ask questions and to discus any problems which you have
encountered.</p>

<p>The Physical Crystallography Group have a session on "Thin
Film Analysis" on Wednesday morning, when you will be able to
test your new skills.</p>

<h3>Workshop - Powder Diffraction Surgery</h3>

<p align="CENTER"
>11:00 - 12:30 26<sup>th</sup> March 2002</p>

<p>Panel Session chaired by J.K.Cockcroft</p>

<p>Following on from the highly successful workshop on sample
preparation organised by Steve Norval at the BCA 2000 meeting at
Heriot-Watt University, the Industrial Group of the BCA plans to
hold a "Powder Diffraction Surgery", for which active audience
participation is sought. So bring along all your old powder
diffraction problems that have been tucked away for years in
drawers and fire them at experts
 on the panel who will try to
suggest some ideas for solving them! Subjects up for discussion
will include theoretical concerns versus practical realities,
software issues, do thermal ellipsoids mean anything?, best
quantitative practice, and many more.</p>

<h3>Workshop - Introduction to Amorphous Materials</h3>

<p align="CENTER">16:00 - 17:30 26<sup>th</sup> March 2002</p>

<h4>A Tutorial session in two parts.</h4>

<p>Part 1 -
 J.M. Parker, University of Sheffield.</p>

<p>For many purposes the diffuse X-ray scattering produced by a
glassy phase is regarded as a nuisance when trying to obtain
diffraction data from crystalline phases. However it does contain
useful information about the structure and quantity of glassy
phase present, although there are no diffraction pattern
datafiles available to aid this process. In this tutorial session
methods of measuring and interpreting the scattering from the
glassy phase will be 
discussed and a number of case studies of
applications of these techniques presented. Finally the
application of neutron diffraction will be shown to provide
additional valuable information, complementing the results
obtainable using X-rays.</p>

<p>Part 2 - G. R. Mitchell, University of Reading.</p>

<p>Many materials exhibit structures containing both crystalline
and non-crystalline phases. A key characteristic of such
semi-crystalline materials is the degree of crystallinity. We can
easily dis
tinguish between the scattering from the crystalline
and amorphous regions of the sample by the sharpness of the
diffraction peaks. In this tutorial session, quantitative methods
of evaluating the crystalline and amorphous fractions of these
samples from x-ray scattering data will be introduced and a
number of examples which illustrate the methodology will be
followed. The relationship between the level of crystallinity or
fraction of amorphous material measured using x-ray scattering
techniques and
 other physical techniques will be discussed.</p>

<p>Starting from a summary of the 'ideal' crystallite and
particle size for quantitative XRD work, practical sample
preparation is discussed in the context of a laboratory carrying
out work for contract analysis customers. Examples of particle
size distributions are given which were obtained from real
samples of mixed phase composition using commonly available
particle reduction equipment (swing mill, McCrone microniser).
The materials discussed include monoclinic/cubic zirconia and
samples contai

<h3>You Expect Me To Analyse That!<br>
Sample Preparation Challenges From Gas-Turbine Materials</h3>

<p><i><b>Colin Small</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Rolls-Royce plc, P.O.Box 31, Derby, DE24 8BJ</b></i></p>

<p>One of the challenges of running a diffraction laboratory in a
diverse organisation like Rolls-Royce is the range and type of
samples that you are presented with. Samples turn up from not
just all over the company but all over t
he world. They can be
large engineering components, rubbish swept of floors and even
dead and decaying birds. They are usually sent in by engineers
who have no idea of the questions that they are asking (much less
the answer) and are invariably spectacularly unsuitable for
mounting on your average diffractometer.</p>

<p>Try putting a Trent turbine disc on a Philips X'Pert system -
you end up with a very flat diffractometer!</p>

<p>This presents the analyst with some real sample preparation
chal
lenges - how do you deal with things that are the wrong
shape, size, dangerous to handle or just plain odd? This
presentation will show you how some of these things are tackled
in Rolls-Royce. Examples of large metallic objects, ingested
powders and even the odd dead bird will be discussed and our
solutions outlined.</p>

<h3>Over Here With That Torque Wrench!<br>
 A Method of Sample Preparation for Quantitative X-ray Powder
Diffraction Analysis.</h3>

<p><i><b>Ri
chard Morris</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Huntsman Surface Sciences, Trinity Street, Oldbury, West
Midlands, B69 4XB</b></i></p>

<p><b>Principle</b></p>

<p>Quantitative X-ray Powder Diffraction Analysis depends upon
reproducible preparation of standard sample windows and that the
degree of operator induced preferred orientation (e.g. any
differences in operator strength) and other sample window
characteristics are kept constant i.e. effectively eliminated on
the front sample surface.</p>

<p>This m
ethod of preparing sample windows involves a
back-loading technique that incorporates a press and window
holder, a backing material (as used in tablet manufacture) and a
torque wrench. It also has the benefit of giving the sample
windows good mechanical strength (nothing worse than having your
lovingly prepared sample fall out of the window onto your freshly
pressed designer jeans - well I suppose the sample dropping into
the goniometer would be worse&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..).</p>

<p>This method
 is primarily used at Huntsman Surface Sciences,
Oldbury for the analysis of sodium triphosphate powders which are
incorporated into some of our "built" heavy duty laundry liquids
- solid detergent particles suspended by a structured surfactant
system.</p>

<p>Sodium triphosphate consists of three main crystalline phases,
two anhydrous phases and a hexahydrate.</p>

<p>It is important that the ratios of the three phase are
accurately known as this effects the rate of dissolution and
hence the per
formance of the product in the consumers washing
machine.</p>

<p>As a grand finale to this presentation I shall demonstrate
this technique<br>
(I hope I don't make a mess of my trousers!).</p>

<h3>Residual Stress and Texture - Sample Requirements and
Preparation</h3>

<p><i><b>QinetiQ, Structures and Materials Centre<br>
Cody Technology Park<br>
Farnborough, Hants GU1
4 0LX</b></i></p>

<p>Sample preparation for X-ray residual stress and texture
measurements are often limited to cutting/sectioning and, for
texture, metallographic polishing. In many cases, for residual
stress measurements, no preparation is necessary and samples are
measured in the 'as-received' condition.</p>

<p>Of equal importance for these techniques, are certain sample
requirements, which will result in good quality raw data. These
requirements, such as grain size, texture, and measurement

location, will be briefly discussed and illustrated with a few
examples from work carried out at QinetiQ.</p>

<h3>Lattice Parameters and Sample Displacement for Common and
Unusual Samples</h3>

<p>Reliable peak positions, and thus d-spacings, are required to
provide accurate cell parameters. Cell parameters are us
eful
because they can provide information such as the chemical
composition, crystalline density, strain and thermal expansion
coefficient. The major systematic error in this type of work is
usually sample displacement: genuine physical displacement and /
or sample transparency. Ways of minimising this error by sample
preparation and special sample holders will be discussed as well
as and mathematical correction methods. The talk will be
illustrated with examples from work on polymers, steel and a hi
gh
temperature conductor.</p>

<p>Polymer samples with their low absorption coefficient can have
a large transparency error. Copolymers, or side-chains, are
commonly added to reduce the melting point and alter mechanical
properties. They usually reduce both crystallinity and
crystalline density <sup>1</sup> but inhomogenity in the
placement of side-chains can alter well-established structure /
property relationships and provide a grade with an improved
balance of properties.</p>

<p>Steel sample
s may have a large grain size which gives poor
sampling and thus less reliable relative intensities. Sample
rotation and a large illuminated specimen area can improve the
sampling. A new steel microstructure with high strength has been
produced <sup>2</sup>. It contains fine grained bainite
(ferrite). Relationships have been established between the carbon
content and cell parameters of both ferrite and austenite
<sup>3</sup>. Thus the experimentally determined cell parameters
provide the carbon cont
ent of both phases which are key values to
confirm the transformation mechanism <sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>For YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O(<sub>7-</sub> ) neutron
diffraction has established that the c parameter of this
orthorhombic structure increases with increasing <sup>5</sup>.
The critical temperature, Tc, and other desirable properties
increase with increasing oxygen content and thus the c parameter
provides on good check on the quality of the sputtered film. We
found some unexpected informatio
n about the cell parameters in a
YBCO film on LaAlO<sub>3</sub> for potential application as a
microwave device <sup>6</sup>.</p>

<h3>From Spinel Analysis to Micro X-ray Diffraction - A Personal
View of Applications and Advances in XRD Techniques</h3>

<p><i><b>Jo Jutson</b></i></p>

<p>My first encounter with XRD was
 in 1965 while working at
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories. Powder diffraction analysis was
carried out using a Debye-Sherrer Camera - first developed in
1916 and still in use. It had low resolution compared with modern
diffractometers and all measurements were manual. The work
involved analysing the oxides which formed on stainless steels
which were candidates for use in the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors
(AGR) being built around that time. These oxides were generally
of two phases: a rhombohedral phase

(Fe<sub>x</sub>Cr<sub>2-x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and a Mn-Fe-Cr
spinel phase (AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The spinel phase was
be an important part of my later work.</p>

<p>After a gap of 20 years I returned to Berkeley Laboratories to
carry out a PhD project which included the synthesis of spinels.
XRD techniques had advanced and the instrument available was a
Phillips PW 1130 diffractometer with chart recorder. This was a
great improvement on the camera and there was soon yet another
step forwa
rd as the group I worked with obtained a Siemens D500
with all the associated software. This now included search and
match programmes and programmes for determining d-spacings, peak
intensity and lattice parameters.</p>

<p>The analysis of aqueous species of zirconium salts using SAXS
techniques followed. By this time it was possible to have an area
detector in the laboratory and when the Cu source was
insufficient trips to Daresbury to use synchotron radiation were
a regular occurrence.</p>

<p>
On to 1991 and back to a Siemens D500 diffractometer. This
time with profile fitting and particle size software; texture
attachments and heating stage. These enabled the structural
analysis of polymers destined for cable insulations as well as
compositional analysis of cable components. Software became
"windows" based and processing became quicker.</p>

<p>My final encounter with XRD was with the micro X-ray
diffractometer. Here was a very intense narrow beam
(50-500microns diameter), XYZ stage to 
locate any area on a
sample, video camera to view the sample, area detector to speed
up analysis time and all the latest software available. Now it
was possible to analyse a sample area as small as 50-500 microns
in 2 minutes. XRD techniques have advanced considerably since I
first used a camera and I am sure will continue to do so.</p>
