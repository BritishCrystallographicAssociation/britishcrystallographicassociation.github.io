</center>
<p>This meeting was held at AstraZeneca's excellent conference
facilities at their Macclesfield site, and attracted seventy
delegates. The meeting was chaired by Roy Copley and myself. We
had nine speakers and the day was split into two themes: the
morning consisted of talks of general pharmaceutical interest,
with considerable time devoted to polymorphism, and the
afternoon's talks concentrated on structure solution and
refinement. I would like to extend my thanks to the speakers for
making this such a fine meeting, with very high quality and
informative talks. The slides for these talks , when available,
are linked within the report below.</p>
<p><b>Roger Davey (Manchester University)</b> opened the meeting
with a personal perspective on <b>'Polymorphism - what have we
learnt?'</b>. Examples from over 100 years of the scientific
literature were given, illustrating the different solubilities of
polymorphs, the solution-mediated transformation of the
metastable to the stable form, the methods of discovering new
forms, the insights into molecular packing and conformation, and
the progress made in the prediction of crystal structures. In
some cases, recent work has confirmed, or re-discovered what was
known several decades ago. Roger questioned the use of high
throughput methods with thousands of experiments and huge
quantities of data. A more thoughtful approach might pay
dividends: for example, using the output from structure
prediction to identify the likely hydrogen bond motifs, and then
devising experiments to produce those motifs. Roger went on to
describe his group's recent work on understanding the links
between molecular clusters present in solution, or the melt, the
structure of the solid on nucleation, and the final crystal
structure.</p>
<p>G<b>ordon Barr (Glasgow University)</b> spoke on the use of
automated cluster analysis of XRPD and Raman data for use in
solid form screens in a talk with a thought-provoking title:
<b>'Is PXRD the Gold Standard in High Throughput
Experiments?'</b> Gordon described the benefits and disadvantages
of XRPD and Raman spectroscopy: preferred orientation and degree
of crystallinity are two disadvantages which can affect the
cluster analysis of XRPD data, while Raman data can suffer from
relatively small differences between polymorphs, variability in
background level, and cosmic ray spikes. Gordon gave examples of
cases in which cluster analysis of a combination of Raman and
XRPD data outperformed the use of either method in isolation, in
particular with respect to mixtures of forms. Gordon also showed
how cluster analysis could be used on DSC data, and gave examples
of quantitative analysis using Raman. He concluded that using a
combination of datasets is the best way of understanding the
properties of a set of samples.</p>
<p><b>Talbir Austin (AstraZeneca)</b> gave a talk titled,
<b>'Understanding relative polymorph stability through structure
and thermodynamics'</b>. She described the process of polymorph
selection of a pharmaceutical and explained how it is essential
to understand which polymorphs can form since their different
physical properties may affect bioavailability, and hence
efficacy, of the drug. Having identified which polymorphs exist,
it is then necessary to understand the stability relationships
between them, to ensure that the form chosen for development is
robust and stable. Tal demonstrated how a combination of methods
are used to understand the relationship between two forms,
including DSC, construction of the E/T diagram, competitive
slurries and sublimation experiments. In the absence of a single
crystal, powder XRD data were used to obtain a crystal structure
of one form (with refinement of the structure of the other form
still in progress). Spectroscopy was used to show that
hydrogen-bonding in the two forms was quite different. Tal
concluded that a combination of structural, thermodynamic and
kinetic studies is required in order to understand
polymorphism.</p>
<p><b>Bill Jones (Cambridge University)</b> described the use of
grinding to produce new forms in his talk <b>'Screening for New
Crystal forms Based on Mechanical Activation of Mixtures'</b>.
Grinding together of components, particularly in the presence of
a drop of solvent, can produce novel co-crystals, salts,
polymorphs and solvates, which solution experiments may (at least
initially) fail to produce. Many examples of new solid forms
produced by grinding were given, including: co-crystals of
caffeine/acetic acid (grinding gives 1:1 as well as 1:2
stoichiometry; solution only gives 1:1), caffeine/TFA (grinding
gives two polymorphs, and the seeds were then used in solution
experiments). The presence of a few drops of solvent was found to
be particularly beneficial and in the case of a salt screen on
pyrimethamine the presence of methanol allowed a reaction in
cases in which dry-grinding did not. Bill recommends including
grinding experiments in solid form screens, particularly as a
quick test for the ability to hydrate, and also recommends
grinding as a possible route to interesting solid-state organic
chemistry.</p>
<p><b>Jerry Heng (Imperial College)</b> considered the importance
of surface functional groups to the behaviour of pharmaceuticals
in his talk, <b>'Crystal Engineering: Importance of Surface
Properties'</b>. Jerry described the use of macroscopic crystals
of paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen (these crystals were
several centimetres across!) to enable physical and chemical
measurements to be made on individual faces. Jerry used a
combination of methods: contact angle measurement, XPS, and
approximations from knowledge of the crystal structure to
understand how wetting properties are affected by the chemistry
of different crystal facets. He showed that the most hydrophobic
faces are those with weakest attachment energies (calculated from
the crystal structure). Jerry went on to discuss the consequences
of this finding for pharmaceutical processing, in which the bulk
drug is milled - a process which probably reveals these
hydrophobic surfaces.</p>
<p>After (a very tasty) lunch, the <b>afternoon session</b>
concentrate on structure solution and refinement. Two themes ran
through all the talks: a sense of confidence that powder data can
be used for structure solution from powders, as long as the data
are good quality, and a requirement that complementary techniques
are used to confirm structures and avoid pitfalls.</p>

Speakers.</strong> From Left to Right: Roy Copley(chair), Fred
Vogt, Maryjane Tremayne, Johnathan Burley, Jacco van de
Streek.</small></p>
</center>
<p><b>Fred Vogt (GSK)</b> spoke on <b>'X-ray diffraction,
Computational Chemistry and NMR: A Multi-disciplinary Approach to
Understanding the Pharmaceutical Solid State'</b>. Fred
demonstrated the use of the combined approach to maximise the
understanding of the structure, dynamics and properties of
pharmaceutical compounds, in order to enable improved control
over the compound, and enable informed decision-making. Fred
described the use of ssNMR in the determination of the crystal
structure of a pharmaceutical compound for which single crystals
were not available; ssNMR showed that an initial structure had a
carboxylic acid group in the wrong orientation, and once this was
corrected it was possible to solve the structure. In another
case, ssNMR was used alongside XRPD, FTIR and GVS (gravimetric
vapour sorption) to understand the mechanism of dehydration of a
pharmaceutical, and the location of the water molecules in the
crystal structure.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Burley (Nottingham University)</b> gave an
introductory lecture - <b>'Cocrystals and Other Complex
Pharmaceutical Materials: Structure Solution from Powder
Diffraction'</b>. He described the process of data collection and
strongly recommended the use of the Debye-Scherrer (i.e.
capillary) over Bragg-Brentano (flat plate) geometry. This was to
avoid or reduce the errors associated with the latter: preferred
orientation, X-ray absorption by the sample and sample height
effects. Jonathan then described how the structure could be
obtained in three stages: indexing, obtaining an approximate
structure solution, and refinement to obtain an accurate
structure; he identified suitable computer programs for each of
these stages. The talk was illustrated by examples of structure
solution including co-crystals, a hydrate and an organo-metallic.
Jonathan concluded by assuring us that it is possible to solve a
range of structures from laboratory data, as long as the data are
high quality. <br>
<a class = "emph" href="AM07abs/JB.pdf">View Presentation</a>... a 5.2MB PDF file.</p>
<p><b>Jacco van de Streek (Frankfurt University)</b> spoke on
<b>'Semi-automated Rietveld Refinement of Molecular Crystal
Structures with DASH and TOPAS'</b>. Jacco described the use of
DASH to direct a Rietveld refinement in TOPAS, by generating
input files, then taking the output files from TOPAS and adapting
them to be used as new input files. This removes the need for
tedious manual intervention, and going back and forth between
DASH and TOPAS, and speeds up the process so that high-quality
Rietveld refinements can be carried out routinely in a matter of
minutes. Jacco confirmed Jonathan's confidence in the usefulness
of powder data for structure solution......as long as the data
are very high quality, and recommended keeping an instrument
dedicated to structure solution. He cautioned that even a
semi-automated structure solution process needs experienced,
knowledgeable scientists to obtain accurate structures.</p>
<p>The first day ended with <b>Maryjane Tremayne (Birmingham
University)</b> speaking on <b>'Powders and 'Peer-Pressure':
Pitfalls and Progress'</b>. Maryjane described her work on the
development of the Cultural Differential Evolution (CDE)
technique for structure solution from powder data. Space will not
permit me to try to outline CDE and it's predecessor,
Differential Evolution (DE) in this paragraph, but suffice to say
that the 'biological' evolutionary approach to the generation of
trial structures is enhanced with the addition of a 'cultural'
driving force, or 'peer pressure' in which the distribution in
values of structural parameters in each generation is used to
guide and enhance the optimisation process. This enables a more
rapid convergence to the global minimum. Maryjane illustrated the
benefits of CDE over DE with several comparisons in which
structure solution was achieved by CDE in far fewer generations
than DE, and one example in which DE failed to obtain a structure
(that of -methyl- -propyl succinimide). The pitfalls identified
by Maryjane included the effects of preferred orientation and the
discovery of a new polymorph when oxamic acid was deuterated.<br>

<h3>Autumn Meeting - 8<sup>th</sup> November 2007, AstraZeneca,
Macclesfield</h3>
<h4>Report BCA Industrial Group Autumn Meeting</h4>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>The British Crystallographic Associations (BCA) Industrial
Group (IG) Autumn meeting was held at the AstraZeneca Silk Road
Business Park site. The day long meeting gathered researchers and
users of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) from industry, university
departments and commercial organisations.</p>
<p>The meeting was an opportunity for BCA-IG members to present
work to their peers and develop a better understanding of XRD
techniques. The day consisted of a series of presentations split
into two sessions. The morning session focussed on the
Applications of Rietveld Refinement. The afternoon session
focussed on Crystallography in Industry.</p>
<p>The meeting was opened with a welcome from Anne Kavanagh
(Astra Zeneca) and Steve Norval (Intertek MSG), thanking all
those attending the meeting and especially those giving
presentations throughout the day.</p>
<h5>Morning Session - Rietveld Applications</h5>

</center>
<p><b>Rietveld: Pitfalls for the non-Expert</b><br>
Jeremy K Cockcroft, University College, London</p>
<p>It is nearly 40 years since Rietveld developed the idea of
whole pattern fitting of powder neutron-diffraction data in order
to refine crystal and magnetic structures. Jeremy reviewed the
method, its development and its uses. For the unwary or
uncritical user, he also highlighted some of the many potential
pitfalls.</p>
<p>H M Rietveld published a paper entitled 'A profile refinement
of nuclear and magnetic structures' in the Journal of Applied
Crystallography 1969 2 pp 65-71. Peak positions are determined by
the unit cell and may be affected by instrument set-up. Peak Area
Intensities are determined by the contents of the unit cell i.e.
crystal structure. Peak width is determined by the measurement
resolution and is a fundamental parameter factor derivation. Peak
shape is a convolution of many symmetric functions - in reality
it approximates very close to Gaussian. Jeremy pointed out that
axial divergence gives asymmetry at low angle. Historically, the
background was determined graphically (by eye) and substracted
from the data. The modern approach is to add the background to
the calibration model.</p>
<p>The refinement approach is to measure y<sub>i</sub>(obs) and
calculate y<sub>i</sub>(calc) from the model and to use classical
non-linear least squares to optimize the parameters.</p>
<p>Brief History</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>Late 1960's: Hugo Rietveld code -Algol</li>
<li>Early 1970's: Alan Hewat - Fortran IV version - distributed
around the world, although it was still only for neutron
diffraction data.</li>
<li>Late 1970's: Ray Young introduced the Rietveld method for
X-ray diffraction data.</li>
<li>Mid 1980's: Bob Van Dreele applied the method to
Time-of-Flight neutron data and laboratory X-rays.</li>
<li>Mid 1990's: New asymmetric peak shapes were
investigated.</li>
<li>Turn of the century: Fast PC's and a fundamental parameter
approach.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The uses of Rietveld have expanded. It can now be used for
structural refinement, quantitative analysis, kinetic analysis
and thermo-diffraction data-analysis. Modern computers,
diffractometers and software are easier to use. However,
beginners have limited crystallographic knowledge and are under
more time pressure and so have less time to think!</p>
<p>To avoid most pitfalls</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>Collect data for the appropriate purpose on an appropriate
instrument under appropriate conditions e.g. if structure is the
key interest then use capillary geometry. Collect high angle data
for longer times to improve the measurement statistics.</li>
<li>Get to know the XRD software and instrument - start with
simple graphical background and build knowledge of how to use the
software.</li>
<li>In getting started with Rietveld Refinement use simple
standard compounds. It is important that parameters are refined
in the correct order:- scale factor, match peak positions, match
relative intensities, match peak shape. Then tweak isotropic
value and site occupancy</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A big problem is trying to extract information not supported
by the Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) data. You could get the
wrong model and the wrong unit cell. Powder diffraction does not
measure symmetry since for high symmetry systems you have
multiple possibilities from the Laue class. Jeremy's final
message was for everyone to be self critical of refinements.</p>
<p><b>Time Resolved Synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction Study of
Biogenic Nano-Magnetite</b><br>
Tony Bell, Daresbury Laboratory</p>
<p>The presentation looked at the transformation of waste iron
oxide into commercially useful materials, by using a type of
bacteria known as Geobacter sulferreducens. Tony described how
the bacterium can produce nanoparticulate magnetite
(Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) by the reduction of amorphous
Fe(III) oxyhydroxide. High resolution synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction data has been used to study samples taken at
different stages of this reaction. Analyses were obtained at the
Swiss Light Source (SLS). Topas Rietveld Refinement and Pair
Distribution Function (PDF) software have been used to
characterize the materials. PDF gives structural information on
the transformations. The work shows that the initial amorphous
phase first transforms to goethite (FeO(OH)), before undergoing a
further transformation to magnetite. Tony said that magnetite is
formed faster in the presence of the 'electron shuttling'
compound disodium anthraquinone 2,6 disulphonate.</p>
<p><b>Versatile Rietveld - Applications to Real
Materials</b><br> Steve Norval, Intertek MSG</p>
<p>Steve began by saying that a basic and common limitation for
many laboratories, especially in industry, is the reality of
non-ideal materials. Real world materials often contain several
phases, some of which can be non-stoichiometric or have uncertain
composition. The good news is that useful information can often
be extracted from non-ideal samples using Rietveld techniques and
the goodness-of-fit criteria considered necessary for
establishing a crystal structure are often un-necessarily severe
for other applications.</p>
<p>Steve went on to discuss the aluminium hydroxide bio-protein
carrier. It has been found to be a less effective carrier after
freezing/thawing. The aqueous gel was dried onto a silicon
crystal surface. Rietveld refinement using Topas showed it to be
very oriented. Freezing followed by thawing was found to produce
colloidal clusters with random orientation. It is believed that
during freezing the gluten on the films squashed the bio-protein
plates. The orientation parameter in the Rietveld software was
used as an indicator of carrier mobility.</p>
<p>A second example was the study of silver bromide crystals in
photographic film. The crystals are AgBr(111) preferentially
aligned with the film but it was found that after developing the
film the AgBr(111) reflection was less intense and broader.
Rietveld analysis is used to study the AgBr crystal
size/distribution and to determine the presence of lattice
distortions. It was found that the silver lattice contracted by
0.09%.</p>
<p><b>Rietveld Refinement of organic molecules: investigation of
hydrogen-bond patterns</b><br>
Michela Brunelli, ESRF, Grenoble</p>
<p>Michela has carried out work at station ID31 at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The synchrotron provides a
high brightness, highly parallel, highly polarised beam with a
wide energy spectrum; 1.5 - 300keV. The particular strengths of
ID31 are accurate peak positions and very high 2-theta and energy
resolutions. 'Hard' energies in the range 6-60keV are produced.
The station can be used for structural studies, in-situ studies,
anomalous scattering, high throughput (using an automatic sample
changer), quantitative analysis, microstructural analysis,
residual strain and Glancing Incidence and Reflectivity work. The
mapping of residual stresses and strains generated by mechanical
surface treatments has also been investigated e.g. those produced
by laser peening, welding, riveting and machining. Once a good
single-phase sample has been analysed it is indexed using
Crysfire or N-Treor.</p>
<p>Michela has investigated hydrogen-bond patterns in organics
and looked into temperature effects. A particular focus has been
the analysis of new nitro-S proligands which have applications in
Biometrics. The role played by water in the crystal structure of
amino-acid has been found to be diverse.</p>
<p><b>Rietveld Fitting of High-throughput Data</b><br>
Stuart Turner, Crystallography, Birkbeck College</p>
<p>Stuart described the experimental methods that have been used
with the Rapid2 detector which is located at station 6.2 of the
Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS). Due to the high time
resolution of this detector, it is possible to collect many
'frames' of data in a short time. This not only enables fast
reactions to be monitored 'in-situ', but also presents the
problem of dealing with large data sets which need to be refined
in a reasonable time. Station 6.2 has the following</p>
<p>      - A computer controlled furnace is used to alter the
sample environment by increasing or decreasing temperature during
the measurement.</p>
<p>      - A liquid nitrogen cryojet (approximately 120K) which
can be used to study negative thermal expansion.</p>
<p>      - A mass flow controller which switches gasses
sequentially. An open-ended capillary with a 'gas-stub' lets gas
through the sample.</p>
<p>      - A solvent can be used which is introduced from a
solvent 'bubbler' inside a water bath. Air passes through the
bubbler from an air line - this transports the solvent.</p>
<p>Reasearch into the dehydration of the industrial by-product,
Gypsum, has been carried out. This has recycling issues. Kiln
Feed raw materials, calcite, quartz, dolomite have also been
examined. High temperature phase transitions have been observed
and the 'setting' times of different types of cement have been
determined. Stuart talked about the 'Le Bail' and 'Rietveld'
refinement methods in the 'Fullprof' suite. He stressed the need
to get good initial models before carrying out batch
refinements.</p>

<h5>Afternoon Session - Crystallography in Industry</h5>
<p><b>Chair: Judith Shackleton</b></p>
<p><b>Inverse Pole Figures - their application to a detailed
understanding of XRPD measurements</b><br>
Ian F. Ferguson, UKAEA, retired</p>
<p>Ian discussed what inverse pole figures are and how they can
be used to obtain a detailed understanding of anomalous intensity
and 'line' positions in X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). Inverse
pole figures are produced by the projection of a pole figure onto
an equatorial plane. A 'Nelson-Riley' function is used. They
reveal information about texture and cell-edge variations.
Specific emphasis was placed on the use of inverse pole figures
in the metals industry. Inverse pole figures can present
different characteristics of a metal such as the number of times
it had been rolled and in what direction. Ian said that this type
of information should be provided by any comprehensive Rietveld
analysis program.</p>
<p><b>Utilising energy dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction
for characterising stresses in two-phase titanium linear friction
welds</b><br>
Moataz Attallah, Materials Science Centre, University of
Manchester</p>
<p>Linear Friction Welding (LFW) is a novel welding technology,
which utlises a combination of frictional heating and plastic
deformation to join difficult-to-weld materials. Moataz discussed
the welding of the Ti-6246 two phase alloy used in the
construction of parts of aircraft engines. The application
environment is extreme with high pressures and temperatures. LFW
is a solid state joining process where frictional heat is
generated by rubbing two components together. The materials are
not melted - only softened. Using LFW for Ti-6246 is of benefit
since it has a more efficient material usage compared with other
welding alternatives. In addition, less oxides are produced
compared with 'fused' welding and the weld is 30% lighter than a
traditional weld. Work was carried out at the ID15A station,
ESRF, Grenoble. Synchrotron X-rays have excellent penetration of
metals, enable short measurement times and offer high resolution.
Multi peak fitting was carried out using GSAS. The phase
fractions and the Young's Modulus and lattice parameter were
determined for each phase. A Field Emission Gun (FEG) Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM) was also used to obtain the size of the
grains. When joining high temperature materials high residual
stresses are generated, which can be detrimental to the joint
properties, requiring development of an appropriate post-weld
heat treatment. Post heat treatment was found to significantly
reduce the stresses in the Ti-6246 alloy caused by the LFW.
Moataz concluded by saying that there are a number of limitations
to the method. These arise from variations in residual stress
across a weld, texture, deformation/re-crystallisation and the
nature of the microstructure (grain size).</p>
<p><b>Industrial Applications of Residual Stress Measurement
using XRD</b><br>
Andrew Winn, Materials Testing and Analysis (MTA) Unit,
Manchester Materials Science Centre</p>
<p>Andrew began by saying residual stresses are those stresses
which reside within a material, component or assembly when all
external forces have been removed. They add or substract from any
applied stresses. To illustrate this he referred to steel rods in
concrete. The rods are held under tension as the concrete sets.
Residual stresses result from a shape mis-fit in the
microstructure of materials (putting a peg in a round hole).
Tensile residual stresses cause cracks to open-up and propagate.
Compressive residual stresses cause cracks to close. More
information can be found at http://www.metalimprovement.com/.
Hole drilling is a destructive method whereas X-ray Powder
Diffraction (XRPD), magnetics, Raman and Ultrasonics (wave speed
measurement) are non-destructive. In XRPD it is strain that is
measured and from this stress is calculated. The lattice planes
are used as a strain gauge. Andrew uses the sin<sup>2</sup>-psi
method to calculate stress.</p>
<p><b>Application of X-ray Diffraction In-Line to Monitor
Solution Mediated Phase Transformations between Polymorphs during
Batch Crystallisation Processes</b><br>
Robert Hammond, University of Leeds</p>
<p>Robert began by saying in-line XRPD had been applied to a
flow-through cell for the quantitative analysis of a polymorphic
phase transformation, within a slurry, during crystallisation
that converted the metastable alpha-form of L-Glutamic Acid (LGA)
to the stable beta-form. Batch crystallisation, often the final
stage in the synthesis of speciality materials and fine materials
and is a quicker way to produce a 'large' amount of material.
However, it can give rise to polymorphic forms. Crystallisation
involves 'nucleation' (3D formation and assembly of molecular
clusters) and 'growth' (2D growth of clusters to crystals). The
crystals need to match the specification with respect to their
size and shape. Early detection of polymorphs is key to the
successful control of polymorphism The in-line instrument has a
Bede Microsource with a curved Position Sensitive Detector (PSD).
Profiles were recorded continuously with data acquisition times
of 200 seconds. The area under representative peaks for each
phase is proportional to the concentration of each phase at that
time. Robert said that the rate limiting process was found to be
the dissolution of the alpha phase of LGA. The study revealed the
detection limits to be 0.4 wt% for the beta form (needle-like
crystals) of LGA in LGA-methanol slurries containing mixtures of
both polymorphs of LGA. It showed that In-Line XRD is a valuable
technique for the measurement of dynamic phase
transformations.</p>
<p><b>Analysis of Polymorphic Forms - Understanding and
Quantifying Packing Similarity</b><br>
James Chisholm, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)</p>
<p>The identification, control and characterisation of
polymorphic forms is of clear importance in the pharmaceutical
industry. XRD is the natural method to identify polymorphs during
crystallisation experiments. As the physicochemical properties
(e.g. solubility, melting point, hardness, chemical stability)
can be highly dependant on the molecular packing pattern, an
understanding of the similarities and differences between
structures at the molecular level is crucial. James uses the new
Materials module of the Mercury Crystal Structures Database (CSD)
which has been used to study the packing patterns of polymorphs,
hydrates and solvates. The Mercury CSD Visualizer program can
compare crystal structures and identify similarities between
polymorphs and specific regions that are similar. It can
investigate packing to provide insights into the forces that
direct crystal growth. Other new features in Mercury allow
searching of the CSD for specific interaction motifs or more
general packing features as well as comparison of the geometries
of these features.</p>
