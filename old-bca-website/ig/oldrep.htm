<h1><a name="robin95">Instrument Sensitivity Round Robin</a></h1>

<p>The Industrial Group of the BCA are co-ordinating the UK
implementation of an international round robin exercise on Powder
Diffraction Sensitivity for the International Centre for
Diffraction Data (ICDD). The measurements are based on the NIST
standard SRM 1976 Alumina plate a number of which will be
cir
culated around participants who do not have their own. Both
Philips and Siemens have donated standards suitable for their
sample holders.</p>

<p>Participants will be required to run a series of 22 scans with
varying settings of tube current, voltage, step size, slit size
and count times. The data produced will be submitted as plots and
raw data (either hardcopy or PC readable files on floppy discs)
to the UK co-ordinator.</p>

<p>Each participant will be given a user number to ensure
anonymity a
nd on completion will be provided with a summary of
the data obtained from all participants and their individual user
number. This will allow comparison of the performance of their
equipment against the range of other participants. It will
provide a useful basis for ongoing performance tests to check
instrumentation and satisfy the instrument performance criteria
of accreditation.</p>

<p>The round robin will be launched at the Industrial Group
Autumn meeting on 3/11/95. For further information or

<h1><a name="Nov95">BCA Industrial Group Autumn Meeting
1995</a></h1>

<p>The theme of the Autumn Meeting held on the 2nd of November
1995 at the British Steel Swinden Techn
ology Centre in Rotherham
was the analysis of small samples by XRD. It was attended by
about 45 members and non-members. David Naylor welcomed the
meeting to British Steel and introduced the company and its
markets. Thanks to the process and product development carried
out at its three technical centres, British Steel has remained a
major player in the automotive and construction industries.</p>

<p>David Dyson (British Steel, Swinden Technology Centre) then
gave the meeting an historical overview 
of the scope of XRD in
steel-making, recalling the good (?) old days of pumping down the
tube with fingers crossed on a Monday. He surveyed the major uses
of the technique in quantitative analysis and texture work and
gave a glimpse of the future by showing some electron back
scatter patterns which could give pole figures for individual
grains of a sample.</p>

<p>Gordon Cressey (Department of Mineralogy, Natural History
Museum) reported work with a 120 degree curved position sensitive
detector of
 new anode design. He processed his results using a
method by which component patterns are successively stripped from
the sample pattern and quantified. Rapid data acquisition gave
usable patterns in 3 seconds from conventional sized samples and,
hot from the diffractometer, work with a sample holder only two
weeks old showed that when using more conventional counting times
equally good results could be obtained from a sample size of
0.072 cubic mm.<br>
</p>

<p>Kees Brandt (Philips Analytical X-R
ay, Almelo) continued the
small sample theme with a consideration of intensity correction
factor calculations needed when sample mounts such as obliquely
cut single crystals of silicon or quartz are used. For these
small sample holders, which show no interfering lines, the
traditional method of correcting using the intensity of a line
from the mounting plate cannot be used and instead the intensity
ratio of two lines of the sample itself must be corrected using
the intensity ratio found in an infini
tely thick sample. Some
advantages and disadvantages of reporting the results as
concentrations or mass loadings were discussed.<br>
</p>

<p>The major advantages gained by using synchrotron radiation
were exploited in work presented by Professor Watson Fuller
(Keele University) which looked at structural variation in
polymers under industrial processing conditions. Changes in
orientation and crystallinity during drawing have been observed
on a 40 microsecond time scale. Synchrotron radiation can 
be
collimated to give a spatial resolution as fine as 2 microns or
utilised for simultaneous wide angle and small angle scattering
(WAXS and SAXS) and an example was presented of each
technique.</p>

<p>After an excellent lunch and wine courtesy of Rigaku, the BCA
Industrial Group Award, a model of the kaolinite structure, was
presented to Peter Salt in appreciation of a distinguished career
in diffractometry. For over twenty years Peter has been a leader
in the development of quantitative XRD in 
the fields of clay
mineral analysis and crystalline silica determination and this
award paid tribute to his depth of knowledge and experience.
After thanking the Group for the honour, Peter then concentrated
on the vital area of the errors in quantitative diffractometry.
He focused on the importance of understanding particle statistics
illustrated by the decrease in relative standard deviation
obtained as the particle size decreases. However he also reminded
us that the X-ray amorphous layer on the 
surface of particles is
estimated to be approximately 0.03 micron thick and must form a
considerable part of the volume of a 0.5 micron particle.
Consequently very small particles lower the XRD analysis figure.
He summarised by saying that the main sources of error in XRD are
quite well known but that improving accuracy is much more
difficult.</p>

<p>Angelika Iberl (Siemens, Karlsruhe) suggested some different
approaches to the study of small samples. She discussed the use
of a graded multilayer 
as a primary monochromator which can give
a considerable gain in intensity especially with transmission
geometry and capillary mounts. Using a HiStar 2D position
sensitive detector, a point focused beam and cross coupled
mirrors more of the Debye-Sherrer rings can be observed which is
useful for example in forensic work.</p>

<p>David Taylor (Pilkingtons, Omskirk) introduced an
international Round Robin initiated by Ron Jenkins of the ICDD.
The measurements are based on the NIST standard SRM 1976 a
lumina
plate which can be borrowed by participants who do not have their
own and should give the participants a better understanding of
the accuracy of their own instrumentation. This exercise has
already been carried out in the USA, Holland and Australia.<br>
</p>

<p>For the final paper Steve Norval (ICI, Wilton) continued the
validation theme by presenting the meeting with some ideas on
how, over and above the requirements of legislation, XRD users
can ascertain that their instruments are worki
ng the way they
should. The basic instrument and also any add-ons, including
software, could be tested using reference materials or procedures
provided by the manufacturer. Specification of the results that
should be obtained under given conditions for line positions,
intensities and widths or for software line profile analysis
would give the user reassurance and make fault finding
easier.<br>
</p>

<p>The meeting concluded with thanks to British Steel for the use
of their excellent facilities at
 the Swinden Technology Centre
and to David Dyson and David Naylor for hosting the session with
the able assistance of Justin Carpenter and Richard Hughes.

<a name="rest"><strong>Residual Stress
Measurement</strong></a><br>
 

<p>Under the European VAMAS standards scheme, money to coordinate
a four year programme to provide guidelines and to identify
standards for residual stress measurement by neutron 
diffraction
has been made available.</p>

<p>The object of the programme is to produce a draft that will
form the basis for the Standards Bodies to produce an
international standard for this type of measurement. The
programme is academically based, in collaboration with the
European neutron facilities; however input from all interested
parties is welcome.</p>

<p>The current plan is for the academic bodies and neutron
facilities to hold a planning meeting in Grenoble in early
January 1996 to ide
ntify which facilities will be involved, the
scope of the work and the timetable the project will work to. It
is then intended that the national facilities (in the UK this
will be the ISIS spallation source at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory) will consult interested parties within their own
countries. The first meeting of this type could be expected in
mid-1996.</p>

<p>The working party is chaired by Professor G Webster of
Imperial College, and he has requested that the BCA Industrial
Group co
nsider forming an industrially based view of the
programme, how any recommendations might be implemented and how
effective any standards might be.</p>

<p>Although neutron diffraction is not carried out by many
industrial concerns, it is closely allied with X-Ray measurement
of residual stress. The development of procedures and standards
is thus of interest to workers in both fields. <strong>If anyone
has any views on the subject, would like information as it arises
or, hopefully, would like to con
tribute to an industrial input to
the programme, please contact :<br>

<h1><a name="Mar95">Spring Meeting</a> - University of Wales -
Cardiff</h1>

<p>The Joint Spring meeting of the BCA - BACG was held at the
University of Wales, Cardiff on March 27 - 31st 1995, during
which the Industrial Group of the BCA offered a va
ried insight
into the diverse problems encountered within Industry. Jo Jutson
and Craig Adam of the Industrial Group of the BCA brought
together a range of lecturers to offer papers on two broad
subject areas, Novel Materials &amp; Applications, and Rietveld
Analysis in Industry. The latter set of papers was designed to
complement the IG workshop held last autumn in London. A
recurring theme throughout the day was not only the
extraordinarily wide range of problems susceptible to XRD
analysis, but 
also the need for high standards of data
acquisition and the use of secondary techniques to support the
conclusions drawn from XRD.</p>

<p><a name="Pl95">The plenary</a> lecture (Chairman David Dyson)
was presented by Ron Jenkins who offered a fascinating insight
into the work of the ICDD. Ron noted that more progress has been
made in powder diffraction in the last five years than the
previous fifty in terms of new materials and techniques, with
70,000 compounds on file and additions running at 2,
000 per
annum. Of the latter, approximately 1,500 are inorganic and 500
organic, with data being culled from literature references (of
5,000 inspected each year only 1,000 are found to be acceptable
for inclusion), direct contributions to the ICDD (about 200 p.a.)
and data generated by the Grants in Aid (800 or so). The Grants
in Aid scheme was detailed, with interesting data showing that a
swing from an American to a European bias in terms of numbers of
participants has occurred over the last few y
ears. The importance
of this scheme to the continued health of the ICDD database was
clearly made. Some idea of the problems of editorial control was
presented - a diversity of measuring systems from Debye Scherrer
cameras, goniometers through to synchrotron sources to Rietveld
derived data coupled with changing database formats results in a
wide matrix of possible data sets. Choosing the correct (or most
acceptable) format for the future is not trivial, given that the
existing database must remain 
accessible or be re-run (a daunting
task!) The possibility of filing the raw data sets is under
discussion, but the existing database which has taken 60 years to
produce might require 15 - 20 years to recreate and this presents
quite a logistical problem.</p>

<p>Following the plenary lecture, the morning session on Novel
Materials and Applications was started by Tom Ryan of Philips
with a demonstration of the analysis of sub-nanometre films.
Using a sealed tube generator with an open Eulerian crad
le, three
film examples were presented. The first, using an omega - fixed
2theta scan demonstrated the epitaxial growth of a 0.4nm Au film
on Cu. Despite count rates as low as 25cps, very usable traces
were obtained. A second example, layers of 0.5 - 40nm Pd on MgO,
gave not only the mixed orientation of the Pd, but also evidence
of secondary nucleation, confirmed by TEM analysis. The final
example was of a sandwich structure - 8nm of Ni/Fe between 3nms
of Ta. Grain size and orientation were obtaine
d. The use of
standard instrumentation and its ability to analyse such thin
films was made evident.</p>

<p>Frank Buragzy of Siemens offered a interesting approach to the
analysis of thin films and irregular objects by the use of the
"Gobel" mirror - a graded multilayer parabolic reflector which
can be manufactured to yield either parallel beam or focused
optics. A marked increase in reflectivity ( 80% vs 25% for
standard systems ) and the parallel beam give enhanced signal to
noise and the abilit
y to examine rough surfaces. Thus the patina
on a 3rd century South Arabian brass camel could be analysed
directly without damage to the sample. The edge of yoghurt pot
demonstrated the ability to analyse a small area of a low
absorbing "awkwardly shaped" sample. The possibility of using two
cross-coupled mirrors to achieve a point focus system for high
resolution XRD was also presented.</p>

<p>Colin Small of Rolls Royce then presented an insight into jet
engine technology. The higher the operatin
g temperature within an
engine, the better the efficiency but with 8tons of air passing
through a jet engine each minute, temperatures of up to
2,000degC, and up to 50kg of sand per minute on take off from a
desert airfield, analysis of temperature regimes within the
engine is vital. Modelling is used, but is necessarily limited;
thermocouples and pyrometers cannot be used, so recourse is made
to thermochromic paints which reveal the temperatures components
have reached. Colin presented a study of "
reverse engineering" -
the analysis of a thermochromic paint whose precise nature was
not known. XRD played a vital role not only in identifying the
components, but also in detailed studies of the interaction of
the separated components at differing temperatures. With the data
derived from XRD, TGA, DSC and GC/MS, not only was the
formulation determined, but also clues as to the route forward
for higher temperature paints.</p>

<p>Chris Pygall of Alcan rounded up the morning session with a
detaile
d presentation of zirconium sulphate chemistry. Not only
used as hydrocarbon isomerisation catalysts, these phases are
important intermediates in Zr compound formation. The importance
of XRD in identifying the various compounds and the role of
Rietveld analysis was presented.</p>

<p>The afternoon session (chaired by Craig Adam) started with an
overview of the Rietveld method by Andy Fitch. Using this
technique, the ability to refine powder patterns with extensive
Bragg peak overlaps was introduced
, making accessible structural
information from a wide range of materials for which single
crystals were not available, or for examination of crystal phases
under realistic working conditions. Originally formulated for
neutron diffraction it was rapidly extended to time of flight
instruments, synchrotrons and conventional XRD systems. The
choice of technique enables a wide range of problems to be
solved: Fullerenes by Time of Flight experiments; Olivine
structure by XRD; the structure of benzene/hex
afluorobenzene by
synchrotron were some of the examples quoted. The capabilities of
modern Rietveld programmes include multi-phase analysis,
molecular geometry restraints; temperature factor constraints,
etc, resulting in the ability to handle complex structural
refinements. The accuracy of the initial model is, however of
paramount importance, and the latest development of simultaneous
fitting to more than one data set takes advantage of the
complementary nature of the differing radiation sources.<
/p>

<p>Paul Attfield next presented the concept of resonant powder
(anomalous scattering) XRD to elucidate the differing valence
states of absorbing elements, and to refine disordered
structures. The ability to contrast elements with similar atomic
numbers was illustrated by the refinement of the Fe/Ni oxoborate
system, and a variety of complex superconductive materials were
refined using XRD and neutron data simultaneously, taking
advantage of the high selectivity of this methodology.</p>

<p>A
 real-time video presentation was next given by David Bates
of British Gas, showing the use of the DBWS program, together
with the CERIUS molecular modelling package. The application to
ceramics and drill-core samples was demonstrated.</p>

<p>Tony Bell next presented the results of refinements of Leucite
structures ( KAlSi2O6 ) where both framework and extra-framework
cationic substitution has occurred. Using the Rietveld technique
and data derived from high resolution synchrotron XRD powder
studi
es, electron diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy and MAS NMR
( all used to produce a valid initial model ), the structures of
a wide range of compounds were derived. The use of analogues as a
starting point in the refinement was highlighted.</p>

<p>Finally Steve Andrews of ICI presented a cautionary tale.
Rietveld analysis has been used to investigate the structure of
poly(ether-ether-ketone) and poly(ether-ketone), using
crystalline oligomers as analogues of the final polymers. The low
symmetry a
nd unit cell shape (one long and two similar short
axes) results in complex overlapping patterns. Very good fits
were obtained for the 7 ring oligomers and this model was applied
to the polymers. However a recent re-appraisal based on high
resolution synchrotron XRD data of the polymers has shown that
the in-chain bond angles, and axial angles of rotation differ
very slightly between the polymers and oligomers. The need for
data of the highest quality and from as many differing sources
was stressed,
 in order to ensure that the starting model is the
best possible.</p>

<p>The meeting closed with Craig Adam offering thanks to all the
presenters and the BCA organisers.</p>
