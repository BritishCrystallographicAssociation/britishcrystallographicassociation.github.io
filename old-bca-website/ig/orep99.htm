<h1>IUCr XVIII, Glasgow 4-13 Aug 1999</h1>

<p>As you may have noticed the biggest meeting of
crystallographers in 1999 took place in Glasgow earlier this
year. Not many of the industria
l group attended however a few did
manage to get there. A bit of judicious arm twisting, and a
couple of pints of beer, produced 4 "volunteers" to write up
their experiences of a visit to IUCr, Glasgow.</p>

<h3>THOUGHTS FROM IUCr GLASGOW</h3>

<p>After several frantic days of preparing posters, arranging
travel &amp; accommodation and rearranging my family holiday
dates, (yes, there did seem to be some mix-up, which surely could
not have been my fault)
 I was finally in Glasgow for a few days
of the IUCr XVIII Congress. The journey by car from Swindon had
taken rather less time than anticipated so that I was able to
spend a full Thursday afternoon stalking the poster presenters.
Unfortunately, this also meant that I had missed Hugo Rietvelds"
talk in the morning. Arriving at the conference centre
registration desk, I was presented with a weighty conference pack
within which I eventually found a small booklet summarising all
the presentations. Noti
cing that many of the other delegates
seemed to find comfort in this booklet, I kept it to one side for
easy access. It took approximately 30 minutes of reconnaissance
(helped by an plethora of guides), before I saw some familiar,
friendly faces - Dave Taylor (representing ICDD) &amp; close by,
Kate Crennell (BCA).</p>

<p>I returned to the conference centre early on Friday morning in
order to arrange posters (I was acting as a surrogate presenter
for 2 other groups) and listen to one of the keynot
e sessions
that started at 8.25. Following this, I navigated my way through
a series of parallel microsymposia. I felt that one of the
highlights was a talk given by Bob von Dreele (of GSAS fame) who
made the refinement of protein structures from powder data seem
almost routine ! I also had to admire the other speakers in the
<i>Challenging Rietveld Refinements</i> session who showed us
that elegant solutions may be found for even the most difficult
problems &ndash; and all this with Hugo Rietveld s
itting in the
front row !</p>

<p>During the lunch period, I had the opportunity to discuss my
posters with interested delegates. In what seemed a sea of
glossy, colour pictures of proteins (one wavy ribbon looks the
same as the next, to me), there were a few powder diffraction
studies. I was quite disappointed that the materials I am
specifically interested in were poorly represented &ndash; I
don"t suppose the organisers could please all the people all the
time. Also, there did seem to be a sign
ificant number of blank
poster boards ; naturally several were posters I had been keen to
read. The afternoon sessions included a microsymposium on
industrial on-line analysis. For me, this gave diffraction spirit
through applications in the aerospace, semiconductor, cement and
other industries. For some reason, I opted not to attend the
<i>Marks &amp; Spencer shopping evening</i> later that day.</p>

<p>The final day of my attendance started with a refreshing talk
by Bill Tomlinson who impressed h
is audience with several medical
imaging applications based upon his "diffraction enhanced
imaging" technique. This was followed by microsymposia on phase
transitions and thick films all of which left me with a feeling
of inadequacy. I left Glasgow with somewhat mixed feelings. The
Congress had certainly been well organised, and I was very sorry
to have to leave and miss several of the presentations later in
the week. The IUCr Congress had attracted several of the worlds
"major players" and I found 
it gratifying to be able to finally
put faces to names. However, I found the experience rather
solitary &ndash; but that"s probably in my nature. Will I attend
future IUCr Congresses ? &ndash; probably (although the last one
I attended was in 1981!), especially if the Congress managers can
organise a daily registration fee.</p>

<h3>A VIEW FROM THE EXHIBITION HALL</h3>

<p>This was my first experience of an IU
Cr congress and manning
an exhibition stand. The exhibition saw the most extensive array
of crystallography equipment and paraphernalia that I have ever
seen together in one place. With over 40 commercial exhibitors it
proved to be a popular focus point for delegates, many drawn by
the presence of a buzzing internet cafe, food &amp; drink
stations and the ever changing poster boards. To name all the
exhibitors, their new products and the freebies on the stands
would fill the whole Newsletter. It is 
a pity more of the UK
industrial community could not spare their valuable time and
training budget to get to this prestigious event. Perhaps a
lesson to learn is that there is a need to cater for short visits
with focussed days for particular interest groups. With the
exhibition open from 9 till 6 for five consecutive days it was
surprising to see a last minute rush when delegates were informed
that it would close on Monday evening. Perhaps the most amazing
event to watch from the sidelines was on t
he evening of the J.
Monteath-Robertson Symposium Buffet when a hot meal was served in
the exhibition hall in little more than an hour to 1400
delegates. With the hall open until 7.30 that evening the
flagging exhibitors were first in the queue. The most memorable
event especially for our friends from overseas was being led from
the opening ceremony by a pipe band to the Welcome reception. I
would like to think that everyone went home better informed about
our diverse subject.</p>

<h3>30 Years of Rietveld Analysis: The Next Generation</h3>

<p>Held by: Bruker AXS<br>
At: Glasgow University<br>
On: 6th August 1999</p>

<p>Presented by:	Dr A. Kern, Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe<br>
Dr Robert Haberkorn, University of Sweden<br>
Frank Stowasser, University of Bochum</p>

<p>The workshop was intended to review the latest developments in
the field of Rietveld Analysis. As a non-user of Rietveld
Analysis, my reasons for attending the worksh
op were to gain some
background knowledge on how Rietveld Analysis works and what use
it would be in an industrial environment.</p>

<p>An excellent introduction was given to profile analysis, from
single line fitting up to the Rietveld method and microstructure
analysis. With background explained clearly, the new fundamental
parameters approach of Bruker AXS was presented complete with
examples of structural refinement. As a current non-user I didn't"t
quite follow the need to further refine a wel
l documented
structure but discussion with other users during the coffee break
cleared this up. Also, as a non-user of Rietveld analysis, I had
nothing to compare with the new software being showcased, but
judging by the approving murmurs in the audience the decreased
time to perform a structural refinement was obviously impressive.
In addition to structural refinement, ab initio structure
solutions from powder data were also presented, which with the
new fundamental parameters approach have now bec
ome possible.
However, the time required to determine new structures seems to
be on a scale of months, so still only possible for those with
plenty of time to spare!</p>

<p>As an analyst in a commercial laboratory, the applications of
Rietveld analysis were very impressive. Quantitative analysis of
multi-phase powders has long been a problem, limited mostly by
the non-availability of suitable standards for XRD. However, the
current lack of certified reference materials can now be overcome
by whol
e powder fitting by Rietveld Analysis as no standards are
required. In addition to standardless analysis, completely
overlapping phases can also be quantified. Finally,
microstructural analysis was presented, the Rietveld method being
able to determine peak broadening due to crystallite size and
strain.</p>

<p>Limitations of this method were also discussed, particularly
the effects of stacking faults, which unfortunately are not
currently taken into account in profile fitting.</p>

<p>Overall th
e workshop was of use, particularly the background
to Rietveld Analysis and the industrial applications
(quantitative analysis, crystallite size and strain). However it
is also evident that there is still room for improvement
(refinement?), particularly with regards to microstructural
modelling and profile fitting.</p>

<h3>Impressions of XVIII <sup>th</sup>. IUCr Congress,
Glasgow</h3>

<p>When I ar
rived at the IUCr congress my overall impression was
of enormous size and complexity. I have never attended a
conference run on such a "galactic" scale. Such a huge
exhibition, so many events, so many papers and posters.</p>

<p>Sometimes, at conferences the lectures can actually be a bit
of a disappointment, they are a bit dry, cobbled together at the
last minute, extremely specialised, etc. You are left feeling
that you haven"t really learned anything. The IUCr was totally
different. There were s
o many interesting papers, which were, for
the most part very well presented. There was always something new
and interesting to see. I have worked in X-ray diffraction now
for nearly 20 years, looking around the IUCr; I was struck by the
range of applications and by how little I actually know about
some of them.</p>

<p>With six sessions of lectures running simultaneously, my
principle problem was deciding which one to join. Why are two
lectures, which you would really like to hear always on at the

same time?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the conference was very well organised with
military style precision. The program was produced as a small
booklet, of 142 (!) pages and was well set out and very easy to
use. I had no problems finding the right room at the right time.
Some of the sessions were so well attended it was difficult to
get in, even with such large lecture theatres. If you arrive a
bit late and end up at the back of the room it"s difficult to see
overheads with lots of small details.</p>


<p>Sadly, I did not see very many industrial crystallographers,
from the UK, probably because of the cost and the travelling time
to Glasgow. This was disappointing as there was really a lot to
be gained from this conference both academically and socially.
It"s a shame that some company accountants do not appreciate the
value of exchanging information and making contacts.</p>

<h1>Philips 21st Durham Conference on X-ray Analysis</h1>

<h2>University of Durham 20-23 September 1999</h2>

<p>I had never been to a Durham conference before, and I was
regarding it with some trepidation, since I was convinced that
everyone else would know far more than me, and I would resort to
my usual role of being one of the most insignificant participants
who no-one wanted to talk to. However, I couldn't have been more
wrong. Not only did the conference turn out to be more
interesting
 than I imagined - I will never forget the onion model
of the surfactant or the engine testing video, but I got to see
people I hadn't spoken to for ages and meet many new
diffractionists. The wide ranging XRD program included talks
about on-line diffraction systems in places as diverse as
quarries and clean rooms, which I found fascinating, and more
applications than I could dream of -I hadn't really realised that
a diffractometer could be so useful in the everyday world. The
joint XRD/XRF sessions
 were a good idea, the Hitch Hikers Guides
meant that I finally found out what this mysterious XRF thing
was. The best part about the serious side of things was that some
people found my talk interesting, and I was relieved that my many
hours in the X-ray lab and the library trying to produce
something worthwhile that would look good on my overheads had
paid off! Of course, really what everyone wants to know about
conferences is what was the accommodation like and was the food
any good. Well, the fo
od, especially the conference banquet, was
excellent and the accommodation was warm and clean. Mercifully I
wasn't in the castle keep, so avoided the stair marathon,
although the walk too and from the conference centre just about
made up for it. There was also no chance of sitting lonely in
your room, not only were we kept busy all day and revived by
frequent coffee breaks, but we were kept occupied all evening,
relaxed by the odd free drinks reception and enlivened by a quiz
night. The overall feel
 of the conference was that you were there
to learn and to enjoy, and no effort was spared in order to
achieve both these aims. I was extremely glad that I went, and
would recommend it to anyone working in or interested in X-ray
diffraction. I had a wonderful time, and am already considering
what job to get in order to be able to go again in 2 years'
time!</p>

<h1>ICDD Workshop on X-ray Powder Di
ffraction</h1>

<h2>St Helens College, 6-8 December 1999</h2>

<p>This workshop on x-ray powder diffraction was the first of a
series. The International Centre of Diffraction Data (ICDD) plan
to build on the success of their extensive US experience and run
two workshops a year at locations around the world. The
instructors were John Faber and David Taylor, two highly
experienced people in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) field.</p>

<p>The wide-ranging program included sessions on qualitative
analysi
s, phase identification, specimen preparation,
diffractometer set-up and calibration. There were opportunities
during the workshop to gain 'hands-on' experience with search /
match exercises, using both manual and computer methods,
progressing to exercises on semi-quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>I found the workshop both educational and informative, and it
provided an opportunity to meet up with other diffractionists,
new and old.</p>
