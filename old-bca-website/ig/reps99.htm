<h1>BCA IG Forum</h1>

<h2>11-12 April 1999 Royal Court Hotel Coventry</h2>

<h2>Meeting Overview</h2>

<p>The Industrial Crystall
ography Forum, held at the Royal Court
Hotel, Coventry, was a new venture for the BCA's Industrial
Group. It was the first two-day meeting to be organized by the
Group and parallel sessions were introduced for the first time,
to cater for the growing number of members from the
Pharmaceutical industry. The aim of the forum was not simply to
present the latest developments in the field; as implied by the
title, it was an opportunity for industrial crystallographers to
meet and discuss matters of commo
n interest.</p>

<p>After the welcome and introductions by Steve Norval, the
Group's Chairman, parallel special-interest sessions were held
during the morning of Monday, 12 April. One was devoted to
various applications of diffraction methods in materials science,
from residual stress measurement to the formidable problems
associated with obtaining data from explosive materials.
Complementary techniques for determining the structure of
polymorphic pharmaceutical materials were covered in the other

session.</p>

<p>A workshop on applications of the Rietveld method occupied the
early part of the afternoon, followed by the Group's Annual
General Meeting. The Chairman then presented the Industrial Group
Award to Dr David Rendle of the Forensic Science Service. This is
made from time to time in recognition of a sustained contribution
to industrial crystallography and David Rendle is a worthy
recipient of the award. He joined the Metropolitan Police
Forensic Science Laboratory in 1975 and has sin
ce developed
equipment and a range of techniques for working with very small
specimens. His work, involving a wide range of materials and
using X-ray diffraction, fluorescence and radiography, has of
necessity been carried out to the exacting standards required in
the law courts. Appropriately, the award consisted of a mounted
model of the heroin structure! David Rendle then gave the Alun
Bowen Lecture, an annual event to commemorate a former Chairman
of the Group, entitled 'Forensic Applications of
 X-rays'. This
provided an interesting and entertaining insight into the work of
the Forensic Science Service, such as the identification of paint
flakes, glass fragments, hair, fibres and other 'contact traces',
the analysis and quantification of drugs, often providing a means
of ascertaining their source, and the use of radiography to
detect fraud and forgery.</p>

<p>The morning session on Tuesday, 13 April, opened with
contributions on the alignment and performance testing of
diffractometers, 
of importance in ensuring the quality of XRD
data, and this was followed by further papers on industrial
applications. Parallel sessions during the afternoon were devoted
to studies of thin films and to contributions from members in the
pharmaceutical industry. The proceedings concluded with an open
discussion.</p>

<p>The Organizing Committee are to be complimented on devising so
balanced a programme, with about the right mix of plenary and
parallel sessions and a diverse scientific content which

reflected the range of crystallography practised in industrial
laboratories. The forum was well supported, through sponsorship
and active participation, by several firms which provide
diffraction equipment or services. Indeed, it is questionable
whether such an ambitious meeting could have been held without
this support. That the forum attracted in the region of 85
participants demonstrates the value of such a meeting to the
industrial crystallographic community.</p>

<h1>Industrial Group Award 1999</h1>

<h2>Dr David Rendle</h2>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="award/99AWRD.jpg" alt=
"Award Presentation Photograph"></p>

<p>David Rendle (Left in picture)was presented with an Industrial
Group award during the Industrial Crystallography Forum held at
Coventry. The award recognized David's long-term contributions to
the application of crystallography in forensic science.</p>

<p>David studied at Loughborough Universit
y of Technology, then
in Canada at the Universities of Waterloo and Guelph. After a
post doctoral period at the University of British Columbia he
joined the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory in
1975 where he has continued through changes in his role and the
organisation's name. David has also had a long association with
the BCA Industrial Group. He was a founder member and a member of
the Committee from 1989-92.</p>

<p>David has a fine record of analytical work, largely within the
d
iscipline of forensic science. He has specialized in working
with small samples in XRD. This has led to a range of published
papers covering sample preparation, use of Debye-Scherrer cameras
including back reflection, a simple Gandolfi attachment, paint
pigment analysis, drugs and metabolite identification. Special
mention has to be given to the automated Debye-Scherrer camera
developed by David in the Police Forensic Laboratories. He has
also been involved in developing the use of soft X-rays for
d
etecting forgeries, re-sealed envelopes and even serial numbers
filed off engine blocks. All this work has, of necessity, been
carried out to the exacting standards needed for a Court of
Law.</p>

<p>To bring David's involvement with crystallography up to date
and into the wider world, he is an active member of ICDD. He has
championed the cause of organic phases in the Powder Diffraction
File and currently chairs the Organic Materials
sub-committee.</p>

<h1>Diffraction &amp; the Material Scientist</h1>

<p><b>Judith Shackleton</b> of Philips Analytical chaired the
session. The first speaker was <b>Mike Fitzpatrick</b> from the
Open University who talked about the complimentary use of
neutrons and x-rays for residual stress measurement. He briefly
explained the two techniques and highlighted the similarities and
differences (particularly cost and penetration depth) between
them. Mike emphasised t
hat the major benefit of neutrons is that
they can provide a validation method for models and for x-rays in
the case of near surface measurements. He then showed some
results on welds in a 27mm thick section plate. Mike finished by
mentioning some future developments such as the new ENGINE X
neutron instrument at ISIS and the growing use of synchrotron
x-rays.</p>

<p><b>Arnold Vermeulen</b> from Philips Analytical Holland,
talked about techniques for line profile analysis. He showed that
with val
ues of integral breadth, FWHM and peak position from
profile fitting, along with a spreadsheet program such as EXCEL,
it was possible to determine size and strain broadening using
plots created in EXCEL. Examples of instrument resolution
functions, Williamson-Hall plots, and multiple line methods were
shown.</p>

<p><b>Ian Brough</b> from the Manchester Materials Science Centre
talked about Electron BackScattered Diffraction. He briefly
introduced the experimental technique and talked about its use

for texture and grain size measurement/misorientation studies.
The advances in PCs over the last few years has meant that fully
automated data acquisition is now possible with up to 100000
patterns /hr being collected. This meant that data for pole
figures could be collected in minutes compared to several hours
for a conventional x-ray diffractometer. Ian finished off by
talking about some of the applications of the technique such as
crystallography of fracture and phase identification.</p>

<p><
b>Michael Cartwright</b> from Cranfield University was next
up talking about the hazards associated with x-ray diffraction of
explosive materials. He gave an outline of the hazards (e.g.
toxicity,spontaneous combustion in air), and the safety
procedures employed. Mike spoke about several systems such as
RDX, HMX TATP and Azides and explained how x-ray diffraction had
been used to investigate the different polymorphs of these
materials. Lastly, he described a piece of glass apparatus
developed in-hou
se to prepare samples under an inert atmosphere.
He finished the talk with a list of factors to be considered when
dealing with hazardous materials.</p>

<p>The last talk of the morning was by <b>Colin Small</b> of
Rolls-Royce Derby who described how x-ray diffraction was used to
solve a problem with ceramic cores used to manufacture
high-pressure turbine blades. These operate at temperatures above
the material's melting point and therefore require internal
cooling channels Problems were encountere
d with dimensional
stability and flaking of surface layers. The cores are made from
a mixture of amorphous silica, alumina and zircon. Phase analysis
using x-ray diffraction showed that there were differences
between the volume fractions of Cristobalite and amorphous silica
between the surface and centre of the ceramic cores. The
formation of Cristobalite with its associated 6% volume change,
which offset the shrinkage on firing, resulted in improved
dimensional stability of the cores.</p>

<h1>Pharmaceuticals Polymorphism:</h1>

<h2>Supporting Techniques for Structure Determination</h2>

<p>Although the theme of this meeting is industrial applications
of X-ray powder diffraction, the pharmaceutical industry almost
always uses this technique as part of a panel of analytical
techniques for the characterisation of polymorphs and solvates.
It is rare for a single 
technique to provide all the answers.
This, combined with practical considerations such as limited
amounts of sample or the requirement for robust methods at
manufacturing sites, means that a team approach toward
characterisation using a range of methods (usually in R&amp;D) is
required. The presentations in this session covered a range of
techniques, highlighting their advantages and complimentarity to
powder diffraction.</p>

<p><b>Norman Shankland</b> (Univ. of Strathclyde) presented on
"Struct
ural Transformations Observed By Diffraction" and
highlighted the advantages of neutron diffraction for structure
solution using the HRPD (high resolution powder diffractometer at
the ISIS spallation neutron source. Examples described included
the transformations between pyrene II and pyrene I on heating and
the reverse transition on cooling a single crystal. The use of
neutron diffraction to determine the site occupancy of the water
molecules in norfloxacin hydrates, which could not be determined
u
sing X-rays, was discussed.</p>

<p>"Polymorphism Studied by Solid-State NMR" was presented by
<b>Robin Harris</b> (Univ. of Durham) describing the use of
magic-angle spinning NMR for the recognition and quantification
of polymorphs. The number of molecules in the asymmetric unit,
intermolecular interactions and non-bonded interatomic distances
can be determined to provide constraints for full structural
analysis using powder diffraction. Solid-state NMR can also
distinguish static and dynamic diso
rder, be applied to amorphous
systems and be used to characterise heterogeneous systems (e.g.
tablets).</p>

<p>The usefulness of molecular modelling was described by
<b>Roger Davey</b> (UMIST) using the 2 forms of 2,
6-dihydroxybenzoic acid to illustrate how crystal solvent
interactions determine which form is isolated. Crystals of each
form were grown and the molecular interactions at the
fast-growing surface were determined. It is hoped that a more
detailed understanding of these interactions c
an be used to help
the chemist design a more robust isolation procedure.</p>

<p><b>Ian Cooper</b> (Roche Discovery) discussed "Thermal
analysis and thermodynamics in the study of the solid state
properties of drug discovery compounds". DSC,
Modulated-temperature DSC (MTDSC), TGA and Hot-stage microscopy
are powerful discriminatory techniques but can also be used to
determine the relative stability of the known crystalline forms.
Understanding these relationships is important in preventing
convers
ions during scale-up or storage. MTDSC is a relatively new
approach that can offer useful insights into the properties of
amorphous materials via measurement of the glass transition.</p>

<p><b>Gary Nichols</b> (Pfizer Central Research) spoke
provocatively on "Polarised Light Microscopy - probably the most
versatile crystal polymorph probe in the world !" Polarised light
microscopy is more than a century old and there is a danger that
its capabilities are neglected in favour of the more "high-tech"

approaches. Different polymorphs can be distinguished by their
optical properties under polarised light. A hot-stage can be used
to detect solvated crystals and to study conversions between
crystal forms. Polarised light microscopy can also be used to
identify the crystal system.</p>

<p>Finally, <b>Bob Lancaster</b> (Glaxo Wellcome) spoke on
"Vibrational Spectroscopy - Does it still have a role now we all
have powder diffraction capability ?" He answered this in the
affirmative by describing the 
recent advances in these
techniques, particularly FT-Raman spectroscopy and Raman
microscopy. Raman is particularly well-suited to the
characterisation of drug substance in formulations because of the
reduced overlap (<i>c.f</i>. IR) from the excipient signals. IR
is particularly sensitive to hydrogen bonding and hydration.</p>

<h1>Pharmaceutical Special Interest - Polymorphism:</h1>

<h2>Case Histories</h2>

<p>The second pha
rmaceutical session was based upon case
histories of polymorphism. There were six presentations given
from representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. The
presentations focussed on how different analytical techniques
were utilised in conjunction with X-ray crystallography to solve
real problems in solid state chemistry.</p>

<a name="Riet"></a> 

<hr>
<h1>Workshop - Rietveld Analysis</h1>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Jamshed Anwar (Kings College London) started
the workshop by introducing the princi
ples of the Rietveld
method. The technique uses least squares to minimise the
difference between observed and calculated points to give the
best fit over the full powder profile. He stressed the importance
of a high ratio of observations to parameters and that
simultaneous refinement of multiple data sets or rigid body
constraints can be used to obtain this.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A number of applications of the Rietveld
method were then discussed. Martin Vickers (Birkbeck College)
showed that Ri
etveld is not only used for structural refinement
but that profile fitting can be used for quantitative phase
analysis provided that the structure and pattern of the analyte
is known. He demonstrated (after receiving numerous samples!) how
X-ray powder diffraction data can be used to quantitatively
determine the ratio of amorphous to crystalline content in
chocolate.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a least squares analysis, Rietveld needs an
approximately correct structural model to enable successful
s
tructure refinement. This was demonstrated by Bill David
(Rutherford Appleton Lab) in a talk that focused on the structure
determination of pharmaceutical compounds from powder diffraction
data. It is clear that although traditional direct methods can be
used for initial structure solution as in the case of
chlorothiazide, the use of global optimisation methods employing
molecular connectivity represents the most promising route for
the structure solution of more complex molecular materials from
pow
der diffraction data.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Ian Langford (Birmingham University) talked
about the application of the Rietveld method to modelling sample
imperfections by line profile analysis. He explained that
although line breadths and shapes have recently been modelled as
a function of <i>hkl</i> for anisotropic effects, it is difficult
for Rietveld programs to make provision for all possible cases of
sample-induced modifications to instrumental line profiles.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the f
inal presentation, Arnt Kern
(Bruker-AXS) introduced the new fundamental parameters approach
to profile analysis. Instrument and sample contributions are
calculated from first principles both reducing the number of
parameters to be refined and giving refinable parameters that
have real physical significance. The use of this approach along
with improved refinement algorithms was demonstrated by a fully
automated refinement that achieves convergence significantly
faster than conventional Rietveld prog
rams, and is capable of ab
initio structure solution from powder data as part of the
refinement process.</p>

<hr>
<h1>Assuring Quality of XRD measurements</h1>

<p>Performance Testing of XRPD Instruments - <b>Burkhard
Peplinksi,</b> from the Federal Institute for Materials Research
and Testing discussed how the recent advances in computer system
and instrumentation now allow whole pattern Rietveld techniques
to be used to
 determine the precision of X-ray powder diffraction
systems.</p>

<p>Whole pattern methods have allowed a much more rigorous
assessment of the influence of our choice of, for example fixed
or automatic divergence slits. There were some surprising
conclusions regarding the best choice of slits for Rietveld and
other applications. Ordinary, commercially available, calcium
fluoride was used as a standard as well as a pure, synthetic
Cordierite for low 2 theta calibration, always a problem!
Si<sub>3<
/sub>N<sub>4</sub> was also described as a useful
standard. A round robin is also being organised using a silicon
nitride, powder standard, contact burkhard.peplinski@bam.de for
further details.</p>

<p>Diffractometer Alignment- <b>Dave Taylor</b>, a well-known
consultant in the XRD field, outlined the importance of regular
tests to insure that your diffractometer is in good working
order. Many of us treat instruments as " black boxes" to the
detriment of our results! You can use all or part of the

procedures in the BCA Round Robin on Diffractometer Performance.
The tests are available on a floppy. Even just a measure of peak
position and the FWHM, at high and low 2 theta will give insight
into potential problems. Dave talked about the influence of
various aberrations (axial divergence, etc) and how to minimise
them. The procedure for aligning a diffractometer was also
described together with the pros and cons for the various NIST
standards. It appears that the famous silicon standard may ind
eed
be too transparent for precise alignment tests on modern
machines.</p>

<p>A lively discussion followed about the various types of
standards. Also, NIST are preparing a new low angle standard,
silver behenate, the largest d spacing is about 19.5&Aring;.</p>

<p>Determination of Crystallinity and Unit Cell Size of
Faujasites - Faujasites are zeolites and are used as catalysts in
the chemical industry. The crystallinity and unit cell size is
important to their performance. <b>Jan van Mechelen</
b> Shell
International, Amsterdam described a new program, which has been
developed to determine these properties quickly, easily and at
reasonable cost. Jan also discussed the influence of humidity
control, background fitting and the choice of reflections.</p>

<p>Micro-diffraction of Industrial Samples - <b>Jo Jutson</b>
BICC Cables Ltd Energy Technology has just taken delivery of a
new micro-diffraction system. The X-ray beam can irradiate a spot
from 50 to 500&micro; . The instrument uses an ar
ea detector,
which has reduced analysis times from several hours to a few
minutes. Using the laser alignment system you can choose the
exact area of the component which you would like to analyse.
Consequently, the time spent on sample preparation has also been
greatly reduced. Jo described various fascinating applications,
for example she determined the composition of some filaments
which are just 500&micro; across, in situ, with a data collection
time of just 3 minutes. The new instrument had only 
one
disadvantage; Jo's in-tray is now full to overflowing.</p>

<p>Application of Powder Diffraction to Mineral Systems -
<b>Gordon Cressey</b> of the Natural History Museum described
another application of high-speed diffraction. A diffractometer
with a 120 &deg; PSD and a primary Ge 111 monochromator has
enabled whole diffraction patterns to be collected in only 15
seconds. "Snap shots" can be taken of fast reactions, for example
hydration in clays, which occur in only a few seconds. These
"snap
 shot" patterns are of sufficient quality for unit cell
refinement.</p>

<p>A quantitative method based on the subtraction of whole
patterns has also been developed. Good results were obtained as
the problems, which usually arise from preferred orientation, are
reduced when the entire pattern is used.</p>

<p>The system is also excellent for the analysis of very small
samples. For, example a very tiny sample of a black deposit,
removed from the ribs of an ancient skeleton found at an
archaeologic
al site proved to be wood charcoal. The residents had
been breathing in the smoke from their fire.</p>

<p align="right"><em>Judith Shackleton</em></p>

<a name="thflm"></a> 

<hr>
<h1>Thin Films</h1>

<p><b>Paul Fewster</b> (Philips Research Laboratories) opened the
session with a lively presentation entitled 'Analysis techniques
for thin films'. He described how samples need to be defined in
terms of their macroscopic and microscopic properties in relation
to the size of the X-ray probe. An 
appropriate theoretical
approach (i.e. dynamic, kinematic, extended dynamic, optical) and
an appropriate experimental arrangement then need to be selected.
The theoretical approaches were briefly described and a number of
examples provided, with an emphasis on the characterisation of
Epitaxial thin films.</p>

<p><b>Don Wood</b> (RMCS Shrivenham) followed with a well
structured presentation entitled 'Depth Profiling in Solar
Cells'. After a brief introduction about the theory / fabrication
of sola
r cells and the current state of the solar cell industry,
he went on to describe how XRD of bulk specimens of
CdS<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>1-x</sub>. has provided fundamental
structural information - including phase and lattice parameter.
Depth profiling had been achieved by successively etching the
surface in 0.2 micrometer steps and collecting diffraction data.
Changes in lattice parameter and stress close to the junction had
been revealed.</p>

<p><b>Robert Scott</b> (Biomet Merck) gave an excellent
p
resentation about 'Bioprosthetic Coatings' used in orthopaedic
implants (joint replacements). He outlined the importance of
Hydroxyapatite coatings (similar in composition to human bone)
and described how they increase the rate of new bone growth onto
implants. XRD is used to measure the amorphous / crystalline
ratio in these coatings. Control of this ratio is crucial so as
to avoid the undesirable effects of high crystallinity, e.g.
decreased dissolution rate into the body, increased porosity,
decr
eased adhesion to the implant. The results of clinical trials
were outlined including an interesting study of implants that had
been obtained from autopsies (!).</p>

<p>The final presentation of the session was given by <b>Keith
Rogers</b> (Cranfield University). This was a presentation with a
difference. The title, 'Thin Films and Aliens: the Roswell
Mystery Material', gave a clue as what was to come. Keith
described how this 'mystery' material had come into his
possession and the techniques used
 to characterise its structure.
It had been found to be a layered structure containing magnesium,
bismuth and some other minor constituents. Although it is not a
typical Mg engineering alloy, it appears to be of terrestrial
origin. The fundamental questions of how it was produced and why
it was produced still remain largely unanswered. The truth is out
there <i>somewhere</i>!</p>

<h1>Industrial Group Autumn Meeting</h1>


<h2>Workshop on Crystallography, the Internet and
Spreadsheets</h2>

<p>The meeting was opened by Steve Norval, the chairman of the
BCAIG and subsequently run by the organiser, Jeremy Cockcroft.
The first speaker, Lachlan Cranswick, is currently responsible
for CCP14 which covers software for single crystal and powder
diffraction. The role of Collaborative Computational Projects
(CCPs), is to assist universities in developing, maintaining and
distributing computer programs and promoting the best

computational methods. However, Lachlan was keen to point out
that most of this software is also available to industrialists,
either free or for a nominal charge. The tour of software
available in CCP14 started with routines for data conversion from
one format to another (often a real nuisance), though
crystallographic data bases and search match (not much search
match software freely available), peak fitting, powder indexing,
unit cell refinement, full profile fitting and Rietveld
refinement. Thi
s then led to single crystal suites for structure
determination and refinement and programs for structure
visualisation. There is only a limited amount of software for
texture and size/strain analysis. One of the advantages of having
software together in one place is that you can choose the program
best suited to your particular problem. Inevitably there is a
learning curve for every program. There are tutorials for many of
the packages but to get good results programs always need
informed and intel
ligent users. Kate Crennell, the second
speaker, is webmaster of the BCA site. This is a comprehensive
site which includes the BCA news, the Industrial Group
newsletter, notices of forthcoming meetings, for sale and wanted
notices, many matters of general interest and the most visited
spot, job vacancies. The site has links to other useful sites
such as other crystallographic organisations, train timetables
and maps. Do explore the site, use it and tell Kate if there is
something else that you think
 should be added.</p>

<p>After lunch Steve Norval outlined the pros and cons of buying
commercial software, acquiring software from elsewhere or writing
it yourself. In the last category he mentioned the well used
Fortran, C, different types of BASIC, software systems such as
Mathcad or Mathematica and spreadsheets. Steve then showed some
examples of work in a variety of packages. David Taylor continued
on the theme of spreadsheets and showed a list of those that have
been contributed to do basic 
and more complex calculations. It is
anticipated that this list will be made available. If you have
spreadsheets that you are willing to share and could be of
interest to others, do contact Dave. Robin Shirley described the
CRYSFIRE system which now links together 8 of the most useful
programs for indexing unit cells from powder data. These programs
differ and thus data which cannot be indexed by one program
should be indexed by another (assuming that the data is of
sufficiently good quality). CRYSF
IRE is available at the CCP14
site. After both the morning and the afternoon talks there was an
opportunity to test most of the software and discuss particular
points with the speakers. Judging by the rate at which people sat
down by a PC the hands-on session was popular. Fortunately
Birkbeck is well equipped and most people got a PC. About 20
people attended the workshop. The general feeling is that the
workshop was interesting, useful and that Jeremy organised
everything very well.</p>
