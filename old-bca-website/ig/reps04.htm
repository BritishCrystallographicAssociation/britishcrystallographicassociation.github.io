<h3>A Report on The SAS Programme of the BCA Spring Meeting held
at UMIST April 2004.</h3>
<p><a href="admin/news2.htm#sas">Photograph of speakers</a>.</p>
<p>The SAS programme really started on Wednesday morning during
the Instrument Calibration session with Dr.Manfred Kriechbaum
from the Institute of Biophysics and X-Ray Structure Research,
Austrian Academy of Sciences;</p>
<p><b>Practical Aspects of SAXS in Industrial Research:</b></p>
<p>In this talk the technical features, setup and application
fields of a modern laboratory small-angle X-ray scattering camera
in industrial research were presented. Emphasis was put on the
nanostructural information content of SAXS in condensed
heterophase (porous) systems, very common in industrial research
and quality control, where SAXS can be an excellent complementary
and even superior method (with respect to gas sorption methods)
for the determination of inner surfaces and interfaces, as it
'sees' also enclosed pores and can be applied to wet samples.
Industrial laboratories are also often faced with the task of
high-throughput screening of multi-component formulations where
the SAXS method can quickly yield nanostructural information when
the SAXS camera is equipped with a flow-through sample cell
attached to an autosampler. Furthermore, there is also the
possibility to combine SAXS simultaneously with another thermal
or spectroscopic method (E.g. simultaneous SAXS-DSC
measurements).</p>
<p>To start the first parallel SAS session it was Vladimir Kogan
of PANalytical with a presentation entitled <b>Comparative SAXS
Measurements Performed by Different Techniques</b></p>
<p>Nowadays modern laboratory x-ray diffractometers are being
considered as possible platforms to perform SAXS experiments,
challenging the performance of dedicated systems.</p>
<p>Vladimir presented the preliminary results of comparative SAXS
measurements on polymers and bio-polymers, obtained using
different experimental set-ups.</p>
<p>This was then followed by Manfred's second talk of the
day;</p>
<p><b>Time-Resolved SAXS Measurements at Synchrotrons:</b></p>
<p>The high-flux and brilliance of X-rays from modern 3rd
generation synchrotrons enable us to follow the nanostructural
development, the supramolecular assembling or molecular mechanism
of phase-transitions in situ and in real-time with a
time-resolution in the millisecond time regime by small-angle
X-ray scattering.</p>
<p>As examples, a variety of such time-resolved experiments,
mostly on biological samples, performed at the SAXS beamline at
ELETTRA, Trieste, Italy, were presented. Among them T-jump and
p-jump relaxation studies on phospholipid phase-transitions
followed by time-resolved SAXS as well as individual setups and
current limitations were discussed.</p>
<p>This was followed by Mary Vickers with <b>Solid Polymers to
Particles in Solution</b> which covered topics as diverse as;</p>
<p>Oriented lamellae in blown polyethylene film,<br>
 Lamellar repeat distances, tie molecules and mechanical
properties,<br>
 Lyocell (Tencel) and voids,<br>
 Hair and breast cancer,<br>
 CaCO<sub>3</sub> in fuels &amp; lubricants,<br>
 PbZrTiO<sub>3</sub> particles in suspension.</p>
<p>The final SAS session of the afternoon was from Andrew
Harrison of Edinburgh University with <b>"In-situ diffraction
studies of microwave driven processes in materials chemistry and
biology"</b></p>
<p>Andrew described how microwave heating is becoming
increasingly important as a method of driving chemical synthesis
and materials processes, both in solution, and in the solid
state. He also highlighted the increasing concerns about the
possible harmful effect that such radiation - as used in mobile
'phones - may have on biological tissue, over and above what
might be expected from consideration of the likely heating
effects at low exposure level. However, both aspects of this
field are served by almost no direct experimental measurements of
the nature of such effects.</p>
<p>The team at Edinburgh University have developed several
different types of microwave reactor that enable them to perform
X-ray or neutron scattering measurements on powders, single
crystals, colloidal and liquid crystal systems during microwave
irradiation, and to measure temperature accurately and precisely.
He described the principles of designing and operating such
equipment, and described some of their work on colloidal growth,
and the potential to use such methods to probe the possible
effect microwave radiation may have on the structure of proteins
and biological membranes.</p>
<p>Thursday 8th April saw the Small Angle session kicking off
with Dmitri Svergun of the European Molecular Biology laboratory
- Hamburg Outstation With <b>Small Angle Scattering Studies of
Biological Macromolecules in solution.</b></p>
<p>Small-angle scattering of X-rays and neutrons (SAS) is a
fundamental tool in the study of biological macromolecules. SAS
allows one to study the structure of native particles in nearly
physiological solutions and to analyse structural changes in
response to variations in external conditions. The scattering
data bears information about the overall shape and internal
structure at a resolution of 1-2 nm. The method is applicable to
a broad range of sizes, from individual macromolecules to
multi-domain proteins and large macromolecular assemblies. Recent
progress in instrumentation and data analysis significantly
enhances resolution and reliability of structural models provided
by the technique and makes SAS a useful complementary tool to
high-resolution methods, in particular, in large-scale structural
studies.</p>
<p>Advanced methods to analyse X-ray and neutron scattering data
from solutions of biological macromolecules were presented
including: ab initio low resolution shape determination;
modelling of quaternary structure by rigid body refinement; ab
initio analysis of medium-angle data to obtain domain structure
from X-ray data; the use of specific deuteration combined with
contrast variation in neutron scattering to construct detailed
inhomogeneous structural models; addition of missing loops and
domains to high resolution protein models; quantitative analysis
of equilibrium mixtures of oligomeric proteins. Practical
applications of the methods were illustrated by recent
examples.</p>
<p>This was then followed by a chap called Richard Morris from
Huntsman Surface Sciences, Oldbury with; <b>"He Scrubs Up Well -
Doesn't He?" or, New Aspects of Expanded Lamellar Surfactants -
Aqueous, Sugar Based Exfoliates.</b></p>
<p>Currently there are two types of body scrub available; aqueous
and non-aqueous.</p>
<p>Aqueous scrubs contain insoluble abrasives e.g. shells, seeds
or pumice and are sold as pastes, gels or thickened
emulsions.</p>
<p>Non-aqueous scrubs contain soluble abrasives i.e. sugar and
salt. Oils, glycols and silicones are used in place of water.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of these products are that the aqueous
scrubs are viscous, difficult to manufacture and the insoluble
abrasives may lead to bacterial contamination. The non- aqueous
scrubs are pastes, which have an oily or greasy feel, difficult
to spread and are expensive.</p>
<p>However, it is now possible to produce water based sugar
scrubs!</p>
<p>It has been discovered that surfactants can be made to form
liquid crystals in saturated sugar solution.</p>
<p>We can see from the SAXS data that the inter-lamellar spacing
is in the region of 500 A. These liquid crystals can support
additional solid particles of sugar. The solid sugar crystals are
suspended indefinitely and act as an exfoliate.</p>
<p>The presentation demonstrated the application of SAXS in the
development of new surfactant technology and Richard also gave a
brief demonstration of how to make you own sugar scrub from
everyday chemicals found in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Markus Winter from Bruker then followed with SAXS from
multi-functional XRD instruments; <b>NanoSTAR - The Universe of
Nanostructure Analysis</b> that described the new Bruker XRD
instrument.</p>
<p>Richard Heenan of ISIS at RAL delivered the final morning
session;</p>
<p><b>SANS - Practicalities and prospects</b></p>
<p>Small angle neutron scattering, SANS, remains a powerful tool
in many areas of science, despite many advances in X-ray
instrumentation. Accelerator based, pulsed neutron sources, such
as ISIS, are the way forward for the future of neutron
scattering. Major new pulsed sources are under construction in
the USA and Japan and a second target station, optimized for cold
neutrons, is to be built at ISIS which will enable a new world
class SANS facility within the UK.</p>
<p>The advantages of pulsed source SANS were outlined and
examples given of SANS science from both LOQ at ISIS and the
continuous source D22 instrument at the ILL reactor in Grenoble.
SANS contrast variation, using deuterated components enables
unique information to be obtained on increasingly complex
systems. Complex sample environment such as pressure cells, flow
and shear cells and stop-flow techniques are readily available to
map system behaviour rather than simply measure single
structures.</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon saw Pete Laity from Cambridge with
<b>Scattering from segmented Co-polymers - a reinterpretation of
SAXS data</b>;</p>
<p>Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been widely used to
study the microphase-separated morphology exhibited by
polyurethanes, which arises through the immiscibility of 'hard'
and 'soft' chain segments. The results are often analysed on the
basis of a lamellar model, which appears to be justified on the
basis of the expected volume fractions of 'hard' and 'soft'
microdomains.</p>
<p>Peter's recent work has re-examined the SAXS data from a
series of segmented co-poly (ether-urethane)s, using a number of
alternative morphological hypotheses. The results suggest that a
lamellar interpretation might not be the best model for
polyurethane systems. On the contrary, the scattering data
obtained from the co-poly(ether-urethane)s under various
experimental conditions could be reproduced using 'globular'
scattering models of the Zernike-Prins or Percus-Yevick types.
This suggested relatively small volume fractions of hard segment
microdomains and a significant persistence of segmental mixing.
Analysing the SAXS data by curve-fitting these models has
revealed considerable new insight into the morphological response
to deformation in these materials and indicated possible links to
mechanical and thermal behaviour.</p>
<p>Next up was Mark Farnworth from Pilkington Glass with <b>X-ray
reflectivity in the glass industry</b>;</p>
<p>Mark described how the techniques of XRPD, GAXRD, pole figures
and X-ray Reflectivity measurements can be used to examine
samples from all stages of glass manufacture, from the
crystalline raw materials to the amorphous final product.</p>
<p>GAXRD is used to examine thin coatings on the glass surface of
hydrophobic coatings, which disperse water.</p>
<p>Refractory materials are examined to determine how much
non-crystalline material is present and the amounts of quartz,
cristobalite and tridymite.</p>
<p>Also, multi-layer stack coatings are examined E.g. Ti
ZrO<sub>2</sub> Ag Si.</p>
<p>Texture maps can be produced which show the degree of texture
in the silver layer of the coatings and the thickness, density,
top and bottom roughness of each individual layer can be
measured.</p>
<p>Finally, Richard Clapperton of Huntsman Surface Sciences
Oldbury gave a fascinating insight into the world of detergent
research with: <b>SAXS Interpretation of Deflocculated Vesicles -
The Route to Superconcentrated Detergents</b></p>
<p>Richard described how liquid detergents contain concentrated
solutions of surfactants and their phase behavior determines the
key physical properties of the detergent, such as viscosity and
storage stability. Whilst the latter can be measured through
techniques such as rheometry, and phase can be identified by
optical microscopy, there are few tools available to the
formulator to characterize the liquid on a molecular level. Small
Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a fast, versatile technique that
enables the finer details of surfactant phases to be determined.
This includes confirmation of phase type and measurement of phase
dimensions, such as water layer thickness between surfactant
bilayers. The effect of additives on phase structure can be
monitored by SAXS, thus assisting product development. The
challenge of achieving superconcentrated detergents has been
greatly simplified by SAXS characterization.</p>
<p>This concluded the SAS sessions and everyone agreed that it
had been an enjoyable and successful event.</p>

<h3>Instrument Calibration Session &ldquo;How to be a
star&rdquo;</h3>
<p><a href="admin/news2.htm#cali">Photograph of speakers</a>.</p>
<p><b>Introduction - <i>Dave Taylor and Jim Kaduk</i></b></p>
<p>The opening introductory session was shared by Dave Taylor and
Jim Kaduk (the new ICDD Chairman). Jim explained the criteria for
a star quality pattern in the ICDD powder diffraction file. Dave
went on to cover the standards available for instrument testing
including non-ambient calibration and gave a reminder of the
lists maintained on the IG web pages. The rapid expansion of the
PDF is a significant factor in driving us towards better
instrument alignment to ensure that phase identification software
pulls up the right matches with the push to tighter search
windows. The need for testing was demonstrated with examples from
the IG Instrument Sensitivity Round Robin and a new spreadsheet
will be available soon to automate checks. The basics of
instrument alignment were then covered. Dave also announced
details of a new low angle Round Robin based on a Ag Behenate
film being launched by the IG this summer. Jim rounded off by
explaining the procedures for submitting &ldquo;star&rdquo;
quality patterns to ICDD for all those new compounds currently
missing from the PDF database.</p>
<p><b>Aspects of calibration in SAXS - <i>Manfred
Kriechbaum</i></b></p>
<p>Manfred covered the difficulties of calibration for SAXS
measurements with nothing in the way of absolute standards.
Rat-tail (tendon collagen) with a spacing of approximately 67nm
is used for checks but it is not very stable especially to
moisture. He also gave an overview of the role of SAXS at the
Austrian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p><b>The European XRPD Standard - <i>Steve Norval</i></b></p>
<p>Steve explained the background to this standard. For XRPD,
there are different instruments, techniques and applications. It
is not the easiest technique to standardize. The motivations for
putting together a 'standards' document include good practice, a
point of reference for producing acceptable data and
demonstrating competence. The title of the document is 'X-ray
Diffraction from Polycrystalline and Amorphous Materials'. It has
been put together by a working group of a technical committee of
the European Commission for Standardisation. 'General Principles'
and 'Procedures' documents were released in 2003 under the
following codings: BSEN 13925-1 and BSEN 13925-2 respectively.
The aim is to release a third document 'Instruments' this year -
BSEN 13925-3. Beyond that, documents on 'Reference Materials' and
'Terminology' will be released. Steve gave an overview of the
contents of the 'Instruments' document. It covers issues such as
types, components, calibration and testing. For the control of a
diffractometer there is component selection, component
configuration, alignment and testing. Procedures have been
established for calibration and instrument
alignment/verification.</p>
<p><b>Lined-Up or Spot-On? The Ups and Downs of Diffractometer
Alignment - <i>Martin Vickers</i></b></p>
<p>Martin gave a very useful and practical guide to the alignment
of the equipment at Birkbeck College which includes both
transmission and reflection geometry. Good alignment produces
accurate 2-theta positions, maximises intensity and produces nice
peak shapes. Useful tricks and a well thought out approach,
designed especially to assist Bruker Users in the tricky art of
alignment, were well received.</p>
<p><b>Stress Instruments - <i>Judith Shackleton</i></b></p>
<p>Judith gave a good overview of the approach required for
residual stress analysis and stressed the importance of accurate
results when measurements rely on very small changes in high
angle measurements. Additional complications arise with the
complex shapes of the components for analysis. Stress is
calculated from Hook&rsquo;s Law [Young's Modulus &ndash;
Stress/Strain] using the sin<sup>2</sup>&psi; method. In effect,
the crystallographic planes act as an atomic scale strain gauge.
A stress-free standard is not required and the method is easy to
carry out, however, the method is only sensitive to the top few
tens of microns of a surface. She explained how an algorithm
developed in conjunction with Rolls Royce was being applied to
peened samples.</p>
<p><b>Calibration for Silver Halides - <i>David
Beveridge</i></b></p>
<p>David explained the problems associated with the photographic
industry and the difficulties of resolving phases which requires
the very precise measurements of a few lines at moderately high
angles. Calibrations are required for peak position, width and
peak profile. Peak widths are often variable and depend upon
chemical variability, strain and grain size. Often in house
standards are required as calibration aids.</p>
<p>The session ended with the chair <b><i>Jeremy
Cockcroft</i></b> thanking the speakers for their contribution to
an interesting session.</p>

<h3>Catalysts in Industry</h3>
<p><a href="admin/news2.htm#catal">Photograph of
speakers</a>.</p>
<p><b>X-Ray Diffraction at Johnson Matthey From Cell Parameter to
Fuel Cell. <i>Tim Hyde, Johnson Matthey</i></b></p>
<p>Johnson Matthey's core products are catalysts, precious metals
and specialty chemicals. Tim described the role X-ray diffraction
has played over many years in the support of their research and
development interests. He described how autocatalysts for either
petrol or diesel vehicles are comprised of a ceramic honeycomb
support coated with the catalyst. XRD analysis of the coating
involves phase ID, Crystallite size and lattice parameter
determination of the platinum group catalyst, comprising a
platinum group metal catalyst and various promoters on an oxide
support. After accelerated aging, XRD has proved a useful tool in
determining the efficacy of catalysts towards meeting legislative
emission standards.</p>
<p>Highly efficient and clean fuel cell technology is likely to
be used in future stationary and mobile power application with
catalysts and catalyzed components at their heart. He described
the use of platinum alloy catalysts in proton exchange membrane
fuel cells (PEMFC) and the relationship between observed enhanced
activity, structural features and the x-ray diffraction data.</p>
<p><b>Catalysts In Situ. <i>Steve Norval. ICI plc.</i></b></p>
<p>Heterogeneous catalysts are crucial in making a large
proportion of the chemicals we use daily. Steve described how
they helped produce the fuel in our cars and clean the exhaust
gases. The margarine that many of us eat was oil until it was
catalytically solidified. A catalyst is usually defined as a
substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without
itself being changed by it. The reality is not as simple as that
and the "science" of catalysts can be more like a black art.
Solid catalysts transform chemically and physically as they are
activated for use and throughout their life span. Much of the
relevant information about the performance is at the level we
probe by XRD - phases, crystal structure and microstructure.
However, there is always the likelihood that the catalyst in the
reactor is not the same as the one put in or the one taken out
and that is why the use of in situ measurements are vital to real
understanding. Steve used examples of typical catalyst systems to
describe of the role of XRD in their characterization.</p>
<p><b>Powder X-Ray Diffraction and Heterogeneous Catalysis.
<i>Justin Hargreaves , University of Glasgow.</i></b></p>
<p>Justin gave an academic perspective on the application of
powder x-ray diffraction to heterogeneous catalysts. Many
published studies have simply concentrated on the identification
of catalyst phase composition by standard fingerprint techniques
with the consequent loss of the full range of information
available. Justin described a number of studies which have
concentrated on the deeper understanding of catalytically
relevant systems. Particular emphasis was placed on the
application of line profile analysis for the determination of
microstructural detail with an example from the recent literature
on the Cu/ZnO system being cited. The application of Debye
Function Analysis to the study of highly dispersed supported
metal particles was also reviewed with recent examples of in-situ
application being given.<br>
 <i>Editor's note: Justin's talk will be featured in a special
edition of Crystallography Reviews which will be distributed to
all BCA members in 2005.</i></p>

<p>END OF SPRING MEETING REPORTS Three other 2004 meeting reports follow.</p>
<hr>
<a name="3b"></a> 
<h3>Introduction To Powder Diffraction - One Day Workshop</h3>
 <h5>Manchester Materials Science Centre<br>
10th June 2004</h5>
<p>This event was hosted by Judith Shackleton and was aimed at people new to powder diffraction, those with some experience who need a refresher course or those considering the purchase of equipment.  Our contingent from Liverpool John Moores University fitted that description perfectly.  There were three of us in the party:  myself, an academic with some experience of PXRD; a technician who has considerable experience; and a PhD student with none.  We have recently purchased a new instrument and were appreciative of the opportunity to receive some training by the expert speakers at this meeting.
</p>
<p>The venue was cosy, a seminar room in the Manchester Materials Science Centre.  After being welcomed by Judith Shackleton, the first session was an Introduction to Powder Diffraction led by Jeremy Cockcroft.  He outlined the differences between single crystal and powder diffraction and gave an overview of the factors that dictate the positions and intensities of peaks on a PXRD pattern.    
</p>
<p>Judith then discussed instrumentation and sample preparation and gave valuable insights into the operation and maintenance of a powder diffractometer.  I had no idea that X-ray tubes lose intensity over time and have to be regularly checked and eventually replaced.  She also talked about the importance of good sample preparation and how to overcome the difficulty of small quantities of sample.  This was one of the most interesting and useful sessions for me and the smell of the awaiting lunch did not detract from the speaker.
</p>
<p>After the buffet lunch, Dave Taylor spoke about the ICDD powder diffraction file and how this came to be the standard way of recording powder diffraction data.  He related the history of the system and how it has arrived at its present form and the products currently available.  
</p>
<p>Jeremy Cockcroft took the floor for a second time to explain how powder diffraction can be used in quantitative analysis.  He used a whole range of case studies from minerals to pharmaceuticals to illustrate how the different methods can be applied.  For those with some knowledge of structural crystallography, the Reitveld method of refinement of data was discussed.
</p>
<p>Judith Shackleton led the final session, which explored the use of other diffraction techniques including neutron and synchrotron techniques and residual stress measurement.  
</p>
<p>The day included several plenary sessions when the audience could pose questions to the panel of speakers, related either to the material covered or to problems encountered elsewhere.  This was one of the most useful aspects of the day with many attendees asking questions and all of the speakers contributing to the answers.  These sessions were often extended beyond the allotted time and even sent Judith off to the basement, returning with examples of equipment and sample holders to show the audience.  
</p>
<p>This workshop was extremely accessible in terms of duration and fee.  Long training courses are hard to make time for and finding funds can be difficult.  The geography, duration and low cost of this workshop meant that a contingent of three rather than a single representative was able to attend and as a result we were able to consolidate our understanding by discussions after the event.  This was a very successful day, which should become a regular entry in the BCA calendar.

<h3>Report on BCA Industrial Group - Pharmaceutical SIG Meeting
on 5th October 2004. 
<img alt="AZ logo (1K)" src="images/AZspons.jpg" height="41" width="142"></h3>
<p><a href="admin/news6.htm">Photograph of speakers</a>.</p>
<p>This meeting of the Pharmaceutical Special Interest Group was
superbly organised by <b>Anne Kavanagh</b> (AstraZeneca) and
<b>Roy Copley</b> (GSK), and hosted by AstraZeneca at the
company's picturesque Alderley Park site.</p>
<p>After a warm welcome to the meeting by Anne, <b>Rebecca
Booth</b> (AstraZeneca) explained the importance of hydrate
formation in the development of new drugs and the strategies
available for screening compounds for hydrate formation. Whilst
vapour sorption studies are very valuable for studying hydration
processes that are governed by fast kinetics, they are not so
useful for investigation of hydration processes that are under
thermodynamic control and for which the kinetics may be slow.
Such systems are best studied using a slurry method that relies
on the activity of water being directly related to relative
humidity. Rebecca illustrated the advantages of the slurry method
using two case studies, theophylline and an AZ compound. For both
cases, the slurry method proved much faster at assessing the
relative stabilities of hydrates and anhydrous forms.</p>
<p><b>Chris Hunter</b> (University of Sheffield) then explained
how 1H NMR methods can be used to study crystal nucleation in
solution. The technique was originally developed to obtain
structural information from the changes in chemical shift caused
by complexation between two components to form a weakly bound
complex. Chris explained how the technique can be extended to
obtain structural information about molecular aggregates during
the initial stages of precipitation. Chemical shifts are
calculated <i>ab initio</i> for small molecules and then these
are applied to larger molecules. A genetic algorithm approach is
used to refine the chemical shifts allowing the structural model
to be optimised by comparison of calculated and observed chemical
shifts. The technique was illustrated with sulfamerazine, for
which the solution-phase aggregate matches very closely the X-ray
crystal structure, and carbamazepine for which the solution-phase
structure is solvent dependent. In general, the method works well
for relatively rigid molecules and for those for which there is
an abundance of chemical shift information.</p>
<p>After coffee, <b>Gareth Lewis</b> (AstraZeneca) introduced the
importance of salt selection studies in order to optimise the
physicochemical properties of a drug. Interestingly even taste
can be an important factor, especially for paediatric medicines.
Gareth illustrated how remacemide, a potential antagonist for
epilepsy, Parkinsonism and Huntingon's disease, was crystallised
as a variety of salts that were subsequently investigated by
X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures clearly showed
hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic regions depending on the nature of
the counter-anion. The hydrogen-bond motifs were also analysed.
Interestingly, the size and shape of the anions appeared to have
very little effect on the types of structure observed.</p>
<p><b>Ed Collier</b> (formerly UMIST, but now The University of
Manchester) continued with the theme of salt selection and
described the work performed during his PhD. This involved the
preparation of a further 23 salts of the pharmaceutical compound
(1R, 2S)-(-)-ephedrine using combinatorial techniques. Ed
highlighted that during these crystallisation studies, several of
the acids showed variations in their apparent acidity that
depended on the solvent. From these salts, 19 crystal structures
were obtained and the hydrogen-bonding networks and
structure-property relationships were analysed. In addition to
hydrogen-bonded motifs it is clear that - stacking interactions
play an important role in many of the structures. The work has
provided a starting point for a salt screening strategy and has
improved understanding of the reasons for success and failure of
commonly used anions to provide stable, crystalline salts.</p>
<p>After an excellent lunch and photo opportunity, <b>Chris
Gilmore</b> (University of Glasgow) kicked off the afternoon with
a presentation about how to identify polymorphs from the results
of high-throughput screens that involve computer-controlled
crystallisation and data-collection methods. Such data are
frequently complicated by the presence of mixed phases, broad
diffraction peaks, and preferred orientation. Chris explained how
his program PolySNAP can be used to circumvent these problems.
The technique relies on point-by-point matching of powder
patterns rather than simply by matching peaks. A combination of
non-parametric (Spearman) and parametric (Pearson) statistical
methods are used to obtain a correlation matrix. This is then
used to generate a distance matrix, which acts as a source of
classification to generate dendrograms, multidimensional metric
scaling, silhouettes, fuzzy clusters and minimum spanning trees.
These tools allow the data to be partitioned into clusters of
related patterns. The program is very powerful and can readily
detect mixtures of phases or components. Chris and his team have
extended the technique to include additional data from Raman,
infrared, and DSC measurements.</p>
<p><b>Doug Minick</b> (GSK, North Carolina) then described the
chiro-optical technique, of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD)
to aid in the assignment of absolute configurations of chiral
drug molecules. In VCD, polarised infrared spectra are first
recorded for a compound in solution. Because of the time-scale of
the infrared technique, contributions from all of the conformers
present contribute to the observed spectra. Molecular mechanics
calculations are therefore used to identify possible conformers
and then <i>ab initio</i> calculations are then used to obtain
the relative proportions of conformers present and most
importantly the contribution each one makes to the VCD infrared
spectra. After correction of gas-phase frequencies to
solution-phase frequencies, the experimental and theoretical VCD
spectra are compared and conclusions can be drawn about the
absolute configuration of the chiral compound. Although the
technique has some limitations, Doug currently reported a 96%
success rate and he has had 15 assignments subsequently confirmed
by X-ray diffraction.</p>
<p><b>Colin Pulham</b> (University of Edinburgh) finished off the
day with a presentation about the use of high pressure as a means
of searching for new polymorphs and solvates. Although high
pressure is widely recognised in the Physics and Geosciences
communities as a powerful means of inducing phase changes, it is
not a technique that has been widely explored by the chemical or
pharmaceutical communities. Colin illustrated how
recrystallisation in diamond anvil cells can be used to prepare
and characterise new polymorphs and solvates of phenanthrene,
paracetamol, and piracetam. These experiments can be scaled up
and in some cases bulk quantities of these polymorphs and
solvates can be recovered to ambient pressure. He also
demonstrated how the technique can be used to screen for
polymorphs by showing that the 3 known forms of piracetam plus a
new form can be selectively recrystallised simply by changing the
pressure.</p>
<p>Roy Copley concluded the day's proceedings by thanking the
speakers and participants, and urged everyone to support the
Spring BCA Meeting that will include two sessions on the subject
of non-ambient pharmaceutical studies.</p>

<h3>Autumn Meeting "DIY Crystallography" 4<sup>th</sup> Nov 2004  </h3>
<h5>School of Crystallography, Birkbeck College, 
London. </h5>
<p><a href="admin/news7.htm">Photographs of speakers and equipment.</a>.</p>
<p>Forty delegates from UK Universities, Commercial and Industrial institutions attended this one-day meeting, organised by the Industrial Group of the British Crystallographic Association (BCA). The meeting was organised into two main sections - Hardware and Software. The speakers addressed the Do-It-Yourself aspects of crystallography which are widespread in the field due to the specialised nature of many activities which are not easily catered for in commercial instruments and software. 
</p>
<p><b>Building a High-Resolution Powder Diffractometer </b>(Chiu Tang, DIAMOND)<br />

The synchrotron will have a 'medium' electron beam energy of 3.0GeV. The storage ring has a diameter of 561.6M and it has more than 20 bending magnets. Chiu showed a number of photographs obtained by a colleague flying a model helicopter containing a camera over the site! With 3 diffraction circles its design is highly versatile. The sample chamber is large (40x40x40 cm3) and there is a high precision, heavy-duty, xyz table. 
</p>
<p><b>Oscillating a sample for in-situ furnace studies</b> (Olivier Leynaud, Birkbeck College, UCL)<br />

The project is focussed on in-situ experiments using gasses or vacuum at high temperatures. The furnace needs to be able to heat up to 950C and needs to accommodate capillaries with diameters up to 2mm. Different types of oscillating systems were investigated to oscillate, backwards and forwards, capillaries in the furnace: polarity, piston, wheel-like and it was the latter that was selected. Olivier showed some photographs of the completed device. The device oscillates at 68rpm with a 12V battery. 
</p>
<p><b>Industrial Polymer Processing Studies using Combined SAXS/WAXS Techniques</b>
(Ellen Heeley, Polymer Centre, University of Sheffield). <br />
Ellen began by saying that there is extensive use of polymer films in packaging. Texture is developed during processing but the nucleation in crystallisation is still largely a mystery. Ellen can record Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) data at the same time, which can be combined with rheology studies. The main areas for research are quiescent (slow processes) and sheer induced crystallisation / orientation. 
</p>
<p><b>Multiple Sample Holders</b> (Mark Farnworth, Pilkington plc).<br />
 Mark described two multi-sample holders for the PANalytical Materials Research Diffractometer that he had designed and then had fabricated out of aluminium plate. Use is made of the batch programming software in X'Pert Data Collector. Sample x, y, and z values and the name of the data acquisition program are entered into the 'batch' program. Z values for each sample are determined in the conventional manner, using the dial contact gauge. Mark explained that the plate dimensions had to be carefully calculated to avoid contact with the primary optics and the sample stage.    
</p>
<p><b>A Multi-Sample X-ray Diffractometer with Photographic and Counter Recording</b>
(Jamie Nelson, Gemmological Instruments). <br />
Jamie described the work that he had carried out on the Debye-Scherrer photographic camera. His passion for tinkering with the camera, attaching items such as proportional counters, eventually led to him to receive Fellowship of the Institute of Physics. Jamie described several aspects of diffractometry hardware and used, for a relatively younger audience, unfamiliar terms such as Hole, Slot and Plane mounting or the 'Kelvin Mount'.
</p>
<p><b>MATLAB: A Software Tool for Quick Data Analysis</b> (Christopher Hall, University of Edinburgh). <br />
Christopher described his use of MATLAB 7. He finds several features particularly useful. These include good data input/output, built in utilities and functions, scripting (the stitching together of MATLAB commands into small programs) and a good graphic environment for reports and producing a common 'house' style. Christopher has built up a collection of scripts and utilities for handling synchrotron diffraction data - called XMAT. 
</p>
<p><b>Sharing Software Toolkits </b>(By Ron Ghosh, ILL).<br> Ron explained that over the last thirty to forty years there have been numerous computer languages from 'Plot 10' in the 1960's to modern day 'Windows'. Many of the packages have individual scripting languages and so this, and other complications, often deter the 'novice' from getting involved. He gave a simple demonstration of the use of Fortran for data display, plotting and filtering routines. Individual peaks can be selected for analysis e.g. line broadening. Ron finished the presentation by giving a number of useful internet links (see web version of report). 
</p>
<p><b>DIY Single Crystal Structure Analysis</b> (Richard Cooper, University of Oxford)<br>
Richard described the use of the 'Crystals' package for the analysis of single and twinned X-ray/Neutron Diffraction data.  There are three main areas, Guidance, Validation Criteria and Tools. The Guidance step covers data collection (initial hkl analyses), early refinement, getting a complete model, later refinement, weightings and publication. The script language can access any crystal data or results. The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) can be used to validate chemical geometry. 
</p>
<p><b>CCP14 Developments </b>(Richard Stephenson, UCL, Birkbeck College). <br>The CCP14 website at www.ccp14.ac.uk contains freely available software, including state of the art algorithms and utilities. There is a concentration on crystallography. User feedback optimises the direction of the project. CCP14 contains multiple single crystal suites and multiple powder indexing programs and suites. It has 60GB of software and help files and has 35,000 monthly hits. It has a 'wiki' component (!) by which users can add comments that can be edited by any other user. Thus, the quality of the data is continually refined and improved. 
</p>
<p><b>Making do without the JCPDS </b>(David Beveridge, Ilford).<br> David gave a series of steps that could be used to identify a diffraction pattern without the use of the JCPDS database. A good prior understanding of the sample would be ideal since this could drastically reduce the number of options for identification. A local library of patterns from reference materials can then be used for the search. A good understanding of the crystalline components in common materials would also be helpful. For example, paints contain rutile and anatase titania, kettle fur, soil and building dust contain calcium carbonate (calcite) whereas plaster contains hydrated calcium sulphate (gypsum). 
</p>
<p><b>CRYSFIRE Update </b>(Robin Shirley, University of Surrey)<br>
 Indexing a powder pattern may only be a 6-parameter problem, but can still be a challenge. While methods of treating data have improved greatly, there is till great reliance on high data quality. Robin described the new CRYSFIRE now includes ten indexing programs with different approaches, nd gives figures of merit for 10 or more indexing patterns. The newest version works with Windows XP.
