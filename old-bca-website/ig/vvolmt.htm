SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS</a></h2>

<p>As part of its continuing series of specialist interest
workshops we are holding a meeting to discuss the experimental
industrial Crystallography of samples in special environments.
The choosing of the title for this workshop has been the most

taxing aspect but it is our intention to concentrate on
methodology and to cover particularly x-ray powder diffraction in
high and low temperatures and pressures and gaseous environments
(humidity, corrosion studies etc.) but also probably learning
from experiences in topography and single crystal structure
analysis; and also conditions such as electric or magnetic
fields, radiation, liquids, vibration etc. The intention is that
this should be a workshop rather than a lecture meeting, so the
agend
a is not fixed - it is owned by the participants, however I
am asking some people to chair specific sessions - if you have
any suggestion please let me know . A number of manufacturers
have also been approached for brochures and details of
equipment.</p>

<p>A registration form is included herewith, numbers are strictly
limited (to keep a workshop feel to the meeting) and will be
filled on a first come first served basis. A buffet 'working
lunch' will be provided and after the meeting the bar is no
t far
away, Xmas shopping is a little further away and tours of the
largest Crystallography Department in a British University will
also be available. Student bursaries for travel will be available
and applications should be made to Jim Chisholm (Mineralogy
Dept., British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Road,</p>

<p>London SW7 .5DB 01-938 8816). Participants will be surveyed to
give us list of the more important topics for discussion, and a
list of these, along with a location map and further d
etails will
be returned nearer the date.</p>

<h2><a name="Feb87">IDENTIFICATION AND THE JCPDS POWDER
DIFFRACTION FILE</a></h2>

<p>The sixth in the series of Spe
cialist Symposia, arranged by
the Industrial Group, will be an INTRODUCTORY WORKSHOP on the use
of the Powder Diffraction File, of the JCPDS-International Centre
for Diffraction Data, for identifying unknown materials. It will
be held at the GEC Hirst Research Centre, East Lane, Wembley,
Middlesex (near Wembley North B.R. Station) on Thursday, 19
February 1987, starting at 10.00 a.m. and ending at about 4.00
p.m.</p>

<p>This workshop differs from previous Specialist Symposia; it
will be a practic
al meeting, with workbooks provided by JCPDS. No
previous experience of the use of the Powder File is necessary.
The meeting is open to all - students, technicians, etc. - but
only a limited number of participants can be accommodated. The
charge for the workshop will be &pound;10 and this includes the
cost of a buffet lunch.</p>

<p>Reservations for the workshop, together with payment, should
be sent to me at the above address. Cheques should be made

<p>Following the very successful Workshop which took place during
the last Spring Meeting of the BCA held in York, it is intended
to hold a similar Workshop at the Spring Meeting which takes
place in Edinburgh in April 1987.</p>

<p>The aim of the Workshop is to stimulate discussion and the
interchange of ideas between users of X-ray diffraction
equipment. The emphasis will be on practical aspects and it is
hoped to highlight problem areas and to identify possible
solut
ions.</p>

<p>The Workshop is NOT limited to Industrial Group participants
and all BCA members are welcome. This is your chance to air real
practical problems, no matter how small on any aspect of
diffraction techniques.</p>

<p>Contributions may vary in length from between 5 and 15

<h2><a name="Oct86">BCA INDUSTRIAL GROUP,</a> SPECIALIST INTEREST
WORKSHOP</h2>

<h3>COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR POWDER* DIFFRACTION PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>It is planned to hold an informal, limited attendance,
workshop on the subject of computer programs for-powder
diffraction.</p>

<p>It will be held in the Microstructural Studies Centre 
of the
Springfields Nuclear Power Development Laboratories, Salwick,
PRESTON, Lanes, PR4 ORR, on Thursday 9 October 1986.</p>

<p>The meeting stems from the concern that I have had for many
years with respect to the extensive but fragmented effort which
is put again and again into this problem.</p>

<p>How do we get those dream programs written and tested. How can
they be immortalised? Who will switch them between languages? Who
should be doing this? Who really understands what he is trying to
do
 in toto? Can the task be co-ordinated? WHO WOULD PAY FOR
IT?</p>

<p>The problem is that successful powder crystallographers tend
to be hidden in industrial corners under paymasters who cannot
spare them.</p>

<p>It is not planned that the meeting will be very big and it
will be attendance by invitation. If interested parties will get
in touch with me at the above address, or at York, or with Judith
Shackleton who is also at Springfields, we shall see what we can
devise that will please everyone
!</p>

<p>*Note deletion of x-ray - the meeting is not meant for example
to exclude neutron diffraction.</p>
