<p><strong>High Throughput Screening: How to Use Raman Spectroscopy and XRPD 
Together.</strong><br>
<strong>Gordon Barr</strong> and Prof. Chris Gilmore, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ.</p>
<p>High throughput screening experiments that search for salts, solvates and 
polymorphs traditionally use X-ray powder diffraction as the gold standard, 
but Raman spectroscopy is becoming increasingly important, 
and instruments to carry out both measurements simultaneously are now on the horizon. We have shown how 
cluster analysis and multivariate statistics can be used to classify data from XRPD sources [1]. In this 
presentation the method is extended to show how Raman spectroscopy data can be incorporated into the 
clustering. The method is non-trivial - merely averaging the results of the two data sources is shown not to work.

<p><strong>The Evolution Of FAFNIR, And The Application Of FENRIS To Crystallite 
Size And Strain Determinations In Pyrolytic Silicon Carbide.<br>
Ian F Ferguson, </strong>Retired (UKAEA).
</p>
<p>
The results of crystallite size and strain measurements on pyrolytic silicon 
carbide will be described. These results were obtained using the program FENRIS. 
The development of this program from FIDO will be described as well as its 
subsequent evolution into FAFNIR. The talk will contain various personal 
reminiscences from the prehistory of XRPD.

<p><strong>Combinatorial CVD- X-ray powder diffraction mapping for the formation and quantification of 
new coatings on glass</strong><br>

<strong>Prof Ivan P Parkin</strong>, Department of Chemistry, University College London.                  
</p>
 

<p>This talk covers the recent work achieved at UCL at developing an area mapping strategy using 
X-ray powder diffraction for thin films on glass.  The strategy involves using a microfocus x-ray 
set up so that a glass plate (8 cm x 20 cm) can be divided up into small 3x3 mm squares and the 
diffraction pattern measured of each square using a microfocus x-ray source.  this enables an X-ray 
contour map of the surface to be built up.  It also enables us to investigate strain, preferred orientation 
and phase change across a surface in a uniform and systematic way.  a couple of commercially relevant 
coatings- self cleaning glass and electrochromic coatings will be presented as examples of the technique.  
In the self-cleaning glass case- the phase mapping enabled surface texturing and phase analysis of 
rutile/ anatase mixtures.  this mapping technique provided a very useful guide to the functional 
properties of the coating.

<p><strong>Applications of XRPD and X-ray Reflectometry in the glass industry <br>  

Mark Farnworth, </strong>Off Line Coatings and Science Support Group, Pilkington Group Ltd.       
</p>
 

<p>Glass is not traditionally thought of as a good material for analysis by XRPD 
due to its amorphous nature. However, the glass making raw materials and the 
refractory materials that make up parts of the Float Glass Process are 
crystalline and their nature needs to be understood. The presentation will 
begin by showing how refractory materials are measured by XRPD, how the silica 
polymorphs quartz, tridymite and cristobalite are quantified and how the glassy 
phase contents are determined. Attention will then be turned to the XRPD 
analysis of thin coatings applied to the glass surface by Chemical Vapour 
Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD). Of particular interest 
is the measurement of crystallite size, strain and crystallographic texture 
within coatings and the presentation will cover how these various parameters 
are measured. The technique of X-ray Reflectometry (XRR) will also be discussed 
in which the layer thicknesses, densities and surface/interface roughnesses in 
multi-layer coatings stacks are measured.  
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The role of XRPD at BP.		</strong><br>
Andrew Hodge ,  BP Chemicals, Saltend, Hull.</p>
<p>A brief background to BP will be given as context to the chronology of 
the PXRD capability in BP, and how it fits in with other analytical techniques.  
The D8-TXS (rotating anode) and Vantec detector are an incredibly fast 
combination useful for catalyst work, including insitu studies.  
Work typically includes detailed catalyst studies, mineral semiquantitative 
analysis of exploration cores, marine engine deposits, and various unknown 
solids. These require various degrees of crystallographic skill, but where 
the operator is inexperienced then it is very beneficial to have easy to use, 
reliable, current software (PDF4+, Topas, EVA). 
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Dog Food &lsquo;n Diffraction.</strong><br>
Richard Morris, Morris Analytical X-ray Ltd.</p>
<p>
This presentation will describe the use of X-ray powder diffraction in the 
development of a crystalline form of anhydrous trisodium pyrophosphate &ndash; 
Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> &ndash; as used in the industrial 
preparation of meat based pet-food products.

<p><strong>Characterisation of Advanced Semi-conductor Materials using HR XRD and how this 
compares with other techniques, such as TEM, PL, SIMS.<br>
</strong>
<strong>Chris Staddon</strong>, School of Physics &amp; Astronomy, University of Nottingham, NG7 2RD.
</p>
<p>As the demand for cheaper, faster, smaller, electronic devices increases there is a 
requirement for more precise control over device fabrication and hence a need for more 
sophisticated characterisation techniques to assess the quality of new materials for f
uture device manufacture. 
In this talk several examples of advanced electronic materials grown at Nottingham 
University will be given, showing how HR XRD can provide detailed information about 
crystal quality and orientation as well as thickness, strain and composition. Data 
from complementary techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Photo 
Luminescence (PL) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) will be given as a comparison.

<p><strong>Powder X-ray Diffraction for Process and Product Support in Shell Global Solutions.</strong><br>
Graham C. Smith, Shell Global Solutions UK,</p>
<p>The Analytical Technology group within Shell Global Solutions provides consultancy, 
analytical services and support to R&amp;D for customers within and external to the Shell group.  
Powder X-ray diffraction is used widely in support of product quality, process R&amp;D, 
product development and in the provision of data to enable rapid solution of production 
issues.  A very wide range of sample types are analysed, covering suspended particulates 
in fuels, lubricants, industrial fluids and process streams through to solids and 
deposits on engine components and process plant.  The talk will outline the 
facilities available and the sample preparation methods used.  Examples will 
be taken from applied R&amp;D, product development and rapid-response problem solving.
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Applications of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) at the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL)</strong><br>

Peter R Stacey, Health and Safety Laboratory, Harpur Hill, Buxton, SK17 9JN.</p>

<p>The talk will discuss the wide range of applications for XRPD in health and 
safety work with an emphasis on how XRPD is used within HSL to assess the risk 
of the exposure of workers to respirable crystalline silica, and to suppor the 
investigative work of the Health and Safety Executive. In addition, the talk 
will describe XRPD's increased use to characterise roofing materials from 
fatal accidents and give an example of some recent commercial work to quantify 
hydroxyapatite in sprayed coatings involving the application of internal s
tandard and external standard and external standard relative intensity ratio 
(RIR) ASTM 2024-00 methods.
