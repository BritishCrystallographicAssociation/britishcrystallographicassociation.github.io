<h1><a name="Course96">Essential Crystallography</a></h1>

for Industrial Powder Diffraction Users 

<h2>1-3 April 1996 at the BCA Spring meeting</h2>

<strong>Course tutor :</strong>-Dr Jeremy K Cockcroft, Department
of Crystallography, Birkbeck College 


<p>A short course is planned on essential crystallography aimed
at industrial users to coincide with the BCA Spring meeting in
Cambridge. The course will commence on the Monday afternoon and
revolve around the Industrial Group session on Structure and Data
(Wednesday morning) with the final session on Wednesday
afternoon. This leaves Thursday morning free for the session on
preferred orientation. The course will consist of eight sessions
and is aimed primarily at XRD users who have little knowledge o
f
the basic crystallography that underpins their day to day
work.</p>

<p><br>
 An outline of the syllabus is given below.<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real Space:</strong><br>
 Crystals including morphology, lattices and planes, unit cells,
packing of atoms and molecules, crystal symmetry, equivalent and
special positions, bonding, interatomic distances and
angles.</li>

<li><strong>Reciprocal Space:</strong><br>
 Diffraction, Reciprocal lattice and hkls, Laue symmetry,
reflection multiplici
ty, systematic absences, space group
determination, d-spacings and indexing, structure factors and
intensities, 3D versus 1D data (single crystal v powder).</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
 Although the level of computational mathematics will be low,
participants should have a reasonable understanding of the
mathematical concepts involved. To ensure that these basic
principles are understood it is planned to distribute to
participants a short primer of relevant mathematical and
crystallographic concepts befo
re the course.</p>

<p><br>
 Attendance at the course is conditional on registration for the
full Spring Meeting. Application will be part of the Spring
Meeting Registration form. For further information contact the
course organiser:- David Taylor<br>

<h1><a name="Award95">Industrial Group Award 95</a></h1>

<h2>Call for Nominations</h2>

<p>It is the intention of the BCA Industrial group to make an
Industrial Crystallography Award to suitable UK crystallographers
working in industry or in academic institutions. The Award will
be given i
n recognition of a sustained contribution to industrial
crystallography including crystallographic and diffraction work of
all kinds.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Industrial group will make the final
decision concerning the Industrial crystallography Award. They
intend the Award to take a form that fittingly marks the
contribution made by the recipient.</p>

<p>Nominations for this Award are invited now and should be sent
to the Secretary of the Industrial group at the address below.
Besides the 
name and affiliation of the person proposed,
nominations should state briefly why she or he merits the Award,
giving a brief account (ideally not more than one sheet of A4) of
her or his crystallographic work and its industrial significance.
The proposer may, if desired, suggest the form which the award
should take.</p>

<h1><a name="robin95">Instrument Sensitivity Round Robin</a></h1>


<p>The Industrial Group of the BCA are co-ordinating the UK
implementation of an international round robin exercise on Powder
Diffraction Sensitivity for the International Centre for
Diffraction Data (ICDD). The measurements are based on the NIST
standard SRM 1976 Alumina plate a number of which will be
circulated around participants who do not have their own. Both
Philips and Siemens have donated standards suitable for their
sample holders.</p>

<p>Participants will be required to run a series
 of 22 scans with
varying settings of tube current, voltage, step size, slit size
and count times. The data produced will be submitted as plots and
raw data (either hardcopy or PC readable files on floppy discs)
to the UK co-ordinator.</p>

<p>Each participant will be given a user number to ensure
anonymity and on completion will be provided with a summary of
the data obtained from all participants and their individual user
number. This will allow comparison of the performance of their
equipment a
gainst the range of other participants. It will
provide a useful basis for ongoing performance tests to check
instrumentation and satisfy the instrument performance criteria
of accreditation.</p>

<p>The round robin will be launched at the Industrial Group
Autumn meeting on 3/11/95. For further information or a
registration form contact the UK co-ordinator - Dave Taylor
