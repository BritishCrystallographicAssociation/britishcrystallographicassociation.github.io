<h1>New Scheme for BCA Membership via Industrial Group NON MEMBER
FEES</h1>
<h6>The Industrial Group has introduced an increase in meeting
fees for NON BCA Members. Details follow:</h6>
<ul>
<li>NON Members will now pay more than members to attend an
Industrial Group meeting.</li>
<li>However, anyone paying the higher NON MEMBER fee has an
option to fund BCA Membership or even BCA Membership
renewal.</li>
<li>Anyone opting to take advantage of using the extra payment to
buy membership will be enrolled for the NEXT full membership year
(January to December).</li>
<li>Existing BCA members can opt to pay the higher NON Member fee
and use the extra payment to fund the following years membership
RENEWAL.</li>
<li>Concessions (Retired, Unemployed and Full time students) are
also included in the scheme, but will find it less expensive to join or renew independently  through the BCA. </li>
<li>The extra cost payable by NON Members will be equivalent to
the highest price BCA FULL membership fee.</li>
<li>The meeting registration form includes all the details
required to process the optional BCA membership application.</li>
<li>All membership applications for a particular year will be
processed after 30th September and NEW members may qualify for a
complementary copy of that years December edition of
Crystallography News.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Your questions answered:</h5>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> Why change from the old
scheme of including free membership in the meeting
fee?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> The old scheme involved a significant
administration burden and some mistakes were inevitable. Members
attending more than one meeting in the year effectively
subsidised other attendees. The costs of arranging meetings and
supplying lunches are increasing and the updated scheme will
allow the Industrial Group to keep its meeting fees as low as
possible for BCA members but still include a route into BCA
membership or renewal.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> Is it less expensive to
independently join the BCA rather than pay the NON MEMBER FEE
?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> IT CAN BE! The additional NON MEMBER cost levied by the
Industrial Group is the same as the equivalent BCA FULL membership
fees when paid by cheque or credit card. However, the BCA does
offer lower fees to STUDENTS, RETIRED, UNEMPLOYED and some members
of the Institute of Physics.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> I am not a BCA member
and will be attending two IG meetings this year. Do I need to pay
two NON MEMBER FEES?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> If you want to become a BCA member then your
best option is to independently enrol for BCA membership and
allow a week before you register as a BCA member for the first IG
meeting. To become a BCA
member an online <a class = "emph" href=
"http://www.crystallography-meetings.org.uk/membership.php">membership form</a> is available.<br>
If, for any reason, you don't want to become a BCA member, then
you will have to pay the NON MEMBER FEE for ALL the meetings you
plan to attend.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> How do I use the scheme
to renew my membership?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Pay the higher NON MEMBER FEE for the
meeting and tick the "Renew a current BCA Membership" Box
.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> Why hold membership
applications until the following year?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> To keep things simple. Often our qualifying
meetings are well into the year so you get the best value, a full
years membership. It also gives the IG flexibility to administer
the scheme more efficiently.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> I am attending an
Autumn meeting in November 2008 what membership period will be
covered?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Membership is for the next full year so in
this case it will be January 2009 - December 2009.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> What happens if I join
through the scheme at a meeting in 2008 but I don't attend a
meeting in 2009 and miss the option of renewing my
membership?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Your BCA membership will become due for
renewal in January 2010. You will receive a membership renewal
notice by post from the BCA and an appropriate payment form to
use if you wish to renew your BCA membership for 2010.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> What is the difference
between a current and lapsed member?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> The only difference is that details of a
lapsed member may still be available on our membership database
and it may be possible to resurrect the old entry.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> What is the definition
of "RETIRED"?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Someone who is no longer in full time
employment.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> What is the definition
of "STUDENT"?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Someone who is a FULL TIME STUDENT.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> What is the definition
of "UNEMPLOYED"?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Someone who is no longer in full time
employment but is actively seeking work.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> Why do I need to fill
out all the information about BCA Groups?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> The registration form combines all the
information required for the meeting registration and for
enrolling as a BCA member. The information on BCA groups helps to
identify your specific interests and allows the Groups to keep
you informed of their activities.</i></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Question:</b> I want to attend an
Industrial Group meeting but don't want to become a BCA member
what should I do?</font></p>
<p><i><b>Answer:</b> Pay the NON MEMBER FEE and tick the box at
the bottom of the form "Please tick this box if you have paid a
NON MEMBER FEE but do NOT wish to take up BCA
Membership".</i></p>
