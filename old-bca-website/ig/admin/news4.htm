<h2>BCA 2005 SPRING MEETING.</h2>
<h3>An overview by the Programme Chair</h3>
<p>Next year&rsquo;s meeting will take place at Loughborough
University from Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> to Thursday
14<sup>th</sup> April. As in recent years, the meeting will run
from 11.00 on the Tuesday to the Thursday afternoon. As this is
not the week immediately before Easter, and recent meetings have
generated internal pressure to increase the time available for
both sessions and informal contacts, there is a possibility we
may run later run a little later on the Thursday than in recent
years (what do you think? &ndash; let me know!). Timings will be
similar to previous years with sessions being made up generally
of one or more 1.5 hour slots.</p>
<p><b>The review theme and plenary sessions.</b></p>
<p>The overall theme to be addressed in four linked plenary talks
is &ldquo;In situ and non-ambient crystallography&rdquo;, which
will include discussion of following structures under change.
This is a very hot area at present and promises some really neat
new ideas and results. Details remain to be fully confirmed, but
the session will include a talk from Phil Coppens, State
University of New York at Buffalo, entitled &ldquo;X,Y,Z and
Time: Introducing the time dimension in crystallographic
research&rdquo;, and one on Process control in the cement
industry using both X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. The
two remaining plenaries are still under discussion, ideas being
followed up including aspects of phase transitions, pressure
induced chemical change, photochemistry, and the trapping of
intermediates in macromolecular crystallography. With this
particular review theme, it seems natural to follow the plenary
talks with a plenary session in which manufacturers of equipment
for non-ambient experiments will be offered a platform to present
the kit they have available.</p>
<p><b>Scientific sessions</b>.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the meeting will be built up of parallel
sessions, of which the following have so far been agreed.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In situ diffraction. This session will probably take place on
the Wednesday, and will likely include processing of inorganic
materials and opportunities for non-ambient and in situ
crystallographic work at central facilities including
DIAMOND.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>On the Thursday, Pam Thomas will lead a session on phase
transitions. Following on from the successful teaching session at
UMIST on using International Tables, this session will start with
an introductory teaching session (do you really know what a phase
transition is? How can you characterise one? Is there really such
a thing as a second order phase transition?).</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Photocrystallography. This session will be chaired by Paul
Raithby (Bath).</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Modern techniques for crystal structure refinement. This
session should be of interest to all crystallographers, as many
of us &ndash; biologists, physicists, chemists, geologists
&ndash; have similar problems and can learn from how others get
round them. Bill Hunter and Simon Parsons will chair this
session.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Sessions are introduced for the X-ray fluorescence community,
who will run a <a href="../meet5xrf.htm">parallel session</a> throughout the meeting that is
likely to be of interest to many of us. It will be organised
jointly by BCA Treasurer Dave Taylor and David Beveridge of
Ilford Ltd. Sessions will include presentations on state of the
art equipment and consumables, working with liquid and awkward
samples (aren&rsquo;t <i>all</i> liquids difficult
samples?&hellip;.), standards and calibration, and light element
analysis.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Other sessions currently being put together address
non-ambient aspects of pharmaceuticals, crystallography in
industry, membrane proteins, high throughput methodologies in
macromolecular crystallography and in situ drug discovery. More
on these later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Workshops.</b></p>
<p>By popular request (yes, really!) we will continue to include
a number of workshop sessions in the programme. For 2005, there
will be, in addition to the workshop aspect of the Phase
Transition session, a Crystals workshop organised by David Watkin
and Richard Cooper from Oxford, and industrial crystallography
and WinGX workshops. Other possible workshop sessions are still
under discussion. We are also examining the possibility of a one
day &lsquo;satellite&rsquo; white beam workshop on the Monday
preceding the meeting.</p>
<p>We are also examining the possibility of building on last
year&rsquo;s experience of holding one or two facility user
meetings just before or after the main meeting.</p>
<p><b>Offer a talk</b>.</p>
<p>Two final points.</p>
<p>Although the Young Crystallographers session at UMIST was
thought to be a great success, we want this year to improve
integration! I heard many of the Young Crystallographers&rsquo;
talks and felt strongly that it was a great pity they
weren&rsquo;t seen and heard by a wider audience. So next year,
we are purposely not filling all the &lsquo;slots&rsquo; in the
scientific sessions with invited speakers. Rather, we are calling
for offers of talks from everyone in the community, a procedure I
have seen work very well in other meetings. Details of how to bid
for of these slots through submitting an abstract will be
publicised later when the overall programme is finalised. But do
begin to think <i>now</i> about either submitting an abstract for
an oral presentation, or encourage your students and postdocs to
do so. There will of course be poster sessions as well, and we
are working to improve the integration of the posters with the
rest of the meeting.</p>
<p>And in addition, check your diary now and make sure that you
have &ldquo;BCA meeting&rdquo; blanking out everything else for
12-14 April 2005. It promises to be an excellent and exciting
three days. If you have any queries or suggestions about the
programme &ndash; perhaps there&rsquo;s a really exciting
development that we haven&rsquo;t included? &ndash; please get in
touch with me. If you have suggestions concerning the individual
sessions, please also contact either me or the session
organiser.</p>
