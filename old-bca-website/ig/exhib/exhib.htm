<p>The Commercial Exhibition is a vital part of the BCA Spring
Meeting and will be located at the heart of the conference. It is
designed to be the main gathering area for delegates throughout
the meeting. All tea/coffee breaks, lunch and Poster Sessions
will take place in the Exhibition area and all lecture theatres
are located close to the Commercial Exhibition.</p>
<p>The Commercial Exhibition will run throughout the duration of
the meeting. It will run from 09.00 hrs on Tuesday 12th April
2005 until 15.30 hrs on Thursday 14th April 2005.</p>
<p>Exhibitors will be given the opportunity to give short
presentations to delegates on the first day of the meeting,
conveniently timed to encourage delegates to visit your stand
during the evening Poster and Exhibition Session. More details
will be given in the Scientific programme, but please note that
the XRF and crystallography exhibitor sessions run in parallel,
so to be involved in both you will need two speakers.</p>
<p>An exhibitor meeting will be held at the venue on 24th February 2005.
This gives exhibitors the opportunity to check out the venue, the
location of their stand, familiarise themselves with access to
the building and raise questions with the organisers. You are
strongly advised to attend this meeting especially if you intend
to display instrumentation on your stand.</p>

insurance cover.</b></p>
