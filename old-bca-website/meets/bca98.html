<h1><a name="Gen">General</a> Information</h1>
<P >
The 1998 Spring Meeting will commence after lunch on Sunday 5th April and
end before lunch on Wednesday 8th April.  Moving the meeting forward by one
full day will allow ease of travel both to and from St Andrews, given the
comparatively long distances involved for many participants.  Those who wish
to fly up are encouraged to do so on the Saturday and accommodation will be
available on the Saturday night.  Good Friday is on the 10th April, so the
earlier finish will allow for easier return travel before the Easter rush -
or you may like to spend Easter in Scotland!


<P>
All scientific sessions, including lectures, workshops, poster sessions and
the commercial exhibition, will be held in the Physics Building. 
Accommodation will be provided at the nearby John Burnett and McIntosh
Halls.  St Andrews is a delightfully picturesque small town with everything
within easy walking distance of the conference site. <P>

<P >
Contributions of posters are invited on any subject within the wide
interests of the BCA.  Prizes will be awarded for the best posters in the
various categories.  A limited number of BCA Bursaries are available to
assist students to attend the meeting.  Information on the submission of
poster abstracts <B>(deadline 16th February)</B> and applications for
Bursaries <B>(deadline 15th January)</B> are given on a later page.  Please
note that electronic submission of Abstracts is a requirement this year.
 <P>

<P >
Early registration is encouraged, and an additional fee will be charged for late registrations <strong>(those received after 6th March)</strong>.
<P >

<P >
The format for the scientific programme (next page) will differ slightly
from recent years in having a <strong>BCA Plenary Session (on Disorder)
</strong>which will draw speakers from each of the BCA's constituent groups. 
Each Group will then have one main session [denoted (1) in the programme]
and one subsidiary session [denoted as (2)], with some of these running in
parallel.  Session titles are: <P >

<h2><a name="Why">BCA </a>SPRING MEETING 1998</h2><strong>
<BR>UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS<BR>Sunday  5 April - Wednesday  8 April 1998
</strong>

<P >
<strong>Why you should attend the St Andrews Meeting</strong>
<P >

1.	A full, varied and exciting scientific programme has been arranged
incorporating a BCA Plenary Session for the first time, together with
constituent Group sessions, Workshops, Posters and a Commercial Exhibition.

<P >
2.	Poster contributions will feature prominently, giving maximum opportunity
for all participants to display their work.  Prizes will be awarded for the
best poster presentations, with the CCG and PCG having an oral session to
encourage participants to visit the posters. <P >

<P >
3.	The Commercial Exhibition will be centrally positioned in the large foyer
area of the Physics Building.  A wide range of companies will display their
latest products, including crystallographic hardware, software, teaching and
research aids and more. <P >

<P >
4.	Take a break! - Why not arrive early? or stay on for Easter in Scotland?
St Andrews is a beautiful and historic town, with a proud academic tradition
and famed for being the "Home of Golf".  As well as providing the
opportunity to play the world's leading courses, there is ready access to
the spectacular Scottish Highlands, with some of Britain's finest scenery
and walking, all within a 2 hour drive. <P >

<P >
5.	St Andrews will provide a real "Taste of Scotland" for those wishing to
get in the mood for IUCr-XVIII in Glasgow 1999, including the traditional
Scottish Ceilidh on the opening evening. <P >

<P >
6.	Costs have been kept to a minimum:  Full BCA members arriving Saturday
and leaving after lunch on Wednesday will pay &pound;255 including all
lunches, the conference dinner and the Ceilidh.  Students and retired BCA
Members can deduct &pound;20 from this total. <P >

<strong>Lecture and Poster Abstract Instructions  (deadline 16th February)<BR></strong>
<P>
<strong>Lecturers </strong>are reminded that they should submit an abstract
of their lecture following the guidelines and instructions given here.

<P >
<strong>Poster </strong>contributions are invited on any aspect of
crystallography: they are an essential part of a successful meeting.  A good
poster has both high scientific content and clear presentation.  Points to
remember:  What are the main points you wish to convey?  Is the poster
eye-catching?  Is there too much text and can it be read from a few feet
away?  Poster boards 1.2m high by 1m wide. Velcro fixings will be provided
for each accepted poster.  <strong>There are prizes for the best poster in
each subject grouping</strong>. <P>

<P >

<P >
<strong>Abstracts may only be submitted electronically</strong> unless there
are serious extenuating circumstances. Full submission details are at
<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/bca98">http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/bca98</a>
 Remember that the UK is hosting IUCr-XVIII in Glasgow in 1999
and we need to get as much experience as possible with electronic abstracts. 
Camera-ready copy may be used by agreement with the Abstracts Organisers
[black print on a single A4 sheet, side margins at least 3cm, top and bottom
margins at least 4cm, minimum type size 12pt].    <P >

<strong><em><a name="CCGtwin">CCG</a> Workshop on Twinning</em> 
(Tuesday 7 April, 14.00 - 15.30)</strong><br>

<P>
With the increasing use of area detectors and more powerful radiation
sources in small-molecule crystallography it is becoming possible to obtain 
data on samples which would have been
discarded a few years ago.  However, many of these samples are not simply
weakly-diffracting but exhibit other problems, including twinning.  The CCG
has organised a Workshop on Twinning which will be led by <strong>Dr Regine
Herbst-Irmer</strong> of the <em>University of G&ouml;ttingen</em> and will begin
at 1400h on Tuesday 7th April.<BR>

<P>
Nowadays most crystal structures of small molecules are solved and refined
by powerful programs with little human intervention. However, there are
still some problems that need the knowledge of the crystallographer and one
of these is twinned crystals.  In the Workshop it will be explained what a
twin is and how one can detect that a crystal is twinned. For the
description of a twin two things are necessary: a description of the
orientation of the different components relative to each other (the twin
law) and the fractional contribution of each component. The derivation of
the twin law will be explained with the help of several examples.  It is
possible to distinguish two kinds of twins, one where there is an exact
overlap of the reciprocal lattices of the components and the other where
they have different reciprocal lattices. Examples of both kinds will be
presented. It will also be shown how it is possible to obtain data from a
non-merohedral twin, where the reflections do not overlap exactly, using a
CCD area detector.  Refinement of twinned structures will be illustrated by
reference to examples using SHELXL, although the principles will be relevant
to other program packages.  There will also be a consideration of special
factors that need to be taken into account.<BR>

<P>
There is no formal registration procedure for the Workshop at which
attendance is free.  However, a charge of not more than &pound;1 will be
levied to cover the cost of producing handouts (purchase optional but
recommended).
