<P>
The University of Nottingham started life in 1798, first as an adult school
and then as a college in the centre of Nottingham before moving to its
current site after World War I. This large estate, three miles west of the
city centre, was provided by one of Nottingham's most famous dignitaries,
Sir Jesse Boot, later Lord Trent, founder of
<A HREF="http://www.boots-plc.com/">The Boots Company</A>.
It has greatly expanded into today's 330-acre University Park Campus.
Set in an extensive belt of woodland, parks, and playing fields, it is now the
focus of life for more than 22,000 students. University Park
is one of the largest and most attractive campuses in the UK, with modern
teaching facilities, 12 halls of residence, a conference and exhibition centre,
and an award-winning main library.

<P>
All delegates who do not wish to book accommodation at the University of
Nottingham will be charged a non-resident supplement of &pound;55.00. This fee
covers morning and afternoon refreshments and all lunches (25, 26, & 27 March),
but <I>not</I> evening dinners.
Non-residents can also buy a &pound;30.00 conference dinner ticket, reduced
rate &pound;15.00 for students.
<P>
Please note that the deadline for early registrations is
<FONT COLOR=#DD0000><B>22 February 2002</B></FONT>.
<B>ALL</B> registrations received after this date will be charged the
late registration rate of &pound;180.00.
<P>
<B>Accommodation</B>
<P>
Please note that accommodation at the University of Nottingham can only
be purchased on a full board basis in three-day packages.
<P>
Each three-day package entitles the delegate to accommodation on the nights
of Monday 25, Tuesday 26, and Wednesday 27 March 2002. All meals apart from
the Conference Dinner are included in this package (i.e. dinner on Monday 25

dinners will be served in Hugh Stewart Hall.
<P>
Two three-day packages are available:

</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Please note: en-suite accommodation is limited and will be allocated
on a first come basis, so early registration is recommended. An
allocation of bedrooms has been reserved in the Hugh Stewart Hall, which
is a short walk from the Pope Building.
Once this allocation is filled, accommodation if available, will be in
outlying halls a 15 to 20 minute walk from the Pope Building.
We would therefore recommend that you register early.
<P>
Please note: en-suite rooms have the sole use of a shared bathroom.
<P>
<B>Meals</B>
<P>
On Monday 25, Tuesday 26, and Wednesday 27 March, lunch will be served in rooms
A13 and A14 of the Pope Building. Dinners (including the Conference Dinner)
will be served in the Hugh Stewart Hall. All meals apart from the conference
dinner are included in the three-day accommodation packages.
<P>
A non-resident supplement of &pound;55.00 will be charged to those delegates
who do not wish to book accommodation at the University of Nottingham. This will
entitle the delegate to lunch on Monday 25, Tuesday 26, and Wednesday 27 March
and to tea/coffee at all breaks.
Please note: the supplement does <I>not</I> include
any evening dinners. The Conference Dinner can be purchased at
a cost of &pound;30.00, reduced to &pound;15.00 for students.

The format of the scientific programme at this BCA Meeting will differ
from previous years.
The sessions are based on current "hot-topics" in the field of
crystallography and cross the boundaries of the various groups of the BCA.
Most sessions are therefore organised by several groups.
There are also many parallel sessions to try and ensure that there are
interesting sessions (hopefully with no conflicts) for all delegates
throughout the conference.
<P>
There is one plenary and one parallel session on <B>New Methods of Structure
Solution and Phasing</B> covering single crystal and polycrystalline analyses.
There are also sessions on <B>Rietveld Refinement</B> and <B>Polymorphism and
Structural Changes</B>, these are areas of great activity in industry and
academia.  "Hot-topics" in the biological field include
<B>DNA Recombination and Repair</B> and the more general area of
<B>Protein Crystallography, Drugs and Disease</B>
and these both have three-hour sessions each.
<B>Detectors</B> are of interest to us all and there is a session on this topic.
<B>Thin Films</B> is a diverse area of activity and a very important
technology requiring challenging methods in analysis and
three hours are devoted to this topic.
In addition, throughout the meeting there will be a series of workshops
including <B>Thin Film Analysis</B>, <B>Amorphous Materials</B>,
<B>Powder Diffraction</B>, <B>Macromolecular Crystallisation</B>,
the <B>CCP4 Program Suite</B> and the <B>CRYSTALS Software</B>.
Also there are prize lectures and special interests groups (SIGs) on
<B>Educational Matters</B> and on the status of the <B>DIAMOND Synchrotron
Project</B>.
<P>
The posters are also a critical part of this meeting bringing a great
opportunity to discuss your latest work over a glass of wine.
All poster exhibitors will have the opportunity to give a brief oral
presentation and a chance to win one of the poster prizes.
We hope that you will find this meeting a very fruitful and enjoyable
scientific experience.

<P>
<B>PCG/ISIS Workshop: Introduction to the Principles and Practice of
Rietveld Refinement</B>
<P>
The workshop will take place immediately prior to the Nottingham BCA meeting,
on Sunday 24 and Monday 25 March, 2002, in Room A63a in the
Economics & Geography Building.
<P>
This meeting is intended to begin a series of tutorial workshops
organised by the PCG on powder diffraction profile refinement methods.
This technique, much used and a vital component of much of
physical crystallography, is very powerful but if improperly used
can lead to problems both in the refinement process itself and
in the resulting structural models.
The aim of these workshops is to provide a general introduction
to the method and its applications. They are aimed both at those
new to the technique, particularly research students and post-docs,
and those who feel the need for a refresher.
<P>
The first of these workshops will introduce the basics of profile
refinement using the Rietveld method.
The workshop will include introductory lectures, demonstrations
and hands-on examples. Topics will include:
<UL>
<LI>principles of Rietveld refinement, including minimisation;
<LI>crystal structure refinement and what it achieves, including the use of constraints and restraints;
<LI>data collection strategies, including angle- and energy-dispersive techniques with both X-ray and neutrons;
<LI>basic refinement strategies - how to give yourself the best chance to get the right result;
<LI>an introduction to some of the software suites available.
</UL>
<P>
Registration forms are now available in
<A HREF="/bca/pcg/rietreg.doc">MS Word</A> or
<A HREF="/bca/pcg/rietreg.pdf">Adobe PDF</A> format.
The cost is just <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>&pound;25</FONT> including accomodation
and meals on Sunday 24<SUP>th</SUP> March.
<P>
Speakers will include <B>Bill David</B> (ISIS/UCL),
<B>Jeremy Cockcroft</B> (Birkbeck) and <B>Kevin Knight</B> (ISIS).
