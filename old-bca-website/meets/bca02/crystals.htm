The CRYSTALS Workshops attached to previous BCA (and other) meetings have
proved astonishingly popular.
A similar small workshop has been scheduled for the morning of
Thursday 28 March.
The format will be the same as at Reading -
a brief presentation on new and changed features,
followed by hands-on experience of the current release
using the 20 PCs available to us.
<P>
We were a bit over-run with participants at Reading,
leading to overcrowding at the workshop.
This year there is a tick-box for the workshop on the meeting registration form.
It would be very helpful if we knew in advance how many people were planning to
attend.
<P>
Richard Cooper and David Watkin will be available throughout the
Spring Meeting to try to help new and experienced users who bring
them particular problems.
