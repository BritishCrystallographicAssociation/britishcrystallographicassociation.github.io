Panel Session: Chaired by J.K.Cockcroft
</CENTER>
<P>
Following on from the highly successful workshop on sample preparation
organised by Steve Norval at the BCA 2000 meeting at Heriot-Watt University,
the Industrial Group of the BCA plans to hold a "Powder Diffraction Surgery",
for which <B>active audience participation</B> is sought. So bring along all your old
powder diffraction problems that have been tucked away for years in drawers and
fire them at experts on the panel who will try to suggest some ideas for
solving them! Subjects up for discussion will include theoretical concerns
versus practical realities, software issues, do thermal ellipsoids mean anything?, best quantitative practice, and many more.
