A Tutorial session in two parts:
<P>
Part I - by <B>J. M. Parker</B>, University of Sheffield.
<P>
For many purposes the diffuse X-ray scattering produced by a glassy 
phase is regarded as a nuisance when trying to obtain diffraction data 
from crystalline phases. However it does contain useful information 
about the structure and quantity of glassy phase present, although there 
are no diffraction pattern datafiles available to aid this process. In 
this tutorial session methods of measuring and interpreting the 
scattering from the glassy phase will be discussed and a number of case 
studies of applications of these techniques presented. Finally the 
application of neutron diffraction will be shown to provide additional 
valuable information, complementing the results obtainable using X-rays.

Part II - by <B>G. R. Mitchell</B>, University of Reading.
<P>
Many materials exhibit structures containing both crystalline and 
non-crystalline phases. A key characteristic of such semi-crystalline
materials is the degree of crystallinity. We can easily distinguish
between the scattering from the crystalline and amorphous regions of the
sample by the sharpness of the diffraction peaks. In this tutorial
session, quantitative methods of evaluating the crystalline and
amorphous fractions of these samples from x-ray scattering data will be
introduced and a number of examples which illustrate the methodology
will be followed. The relationship between the level of crystallinity or
fraction of amorphous material measured using x-ray scattering
techniques and other physical techniques will be discussed.
