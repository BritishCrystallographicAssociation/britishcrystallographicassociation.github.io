(Tutorial on Reflectometry)</B></FONT>

Tuesday 26 March, 9:00 - 10:30
<P>
Organiser: Judith Shackleton
</CENTER>
<P>
The tutorial is designed to give a basic introduction to the analysis of 
thin films. This method is often referred to as 
"Glancing Incidence X-Ray Analysis (GIXA)" or 
"Reflectometry". 
It is used to determine the thickness, roughness, density, etc. of layers, 
which are less than (about) a micron in thickness. 
Typical examples are layers deposited to form electronic devices and 
also optical coatings on glass.
<P>
The tutorial will be divided into three sessions:
Firstly, <B>Paul Fewster</B>, (Philips), will introduce some of the physics 
behind reflectometry. 
Next, the practical aspects of aligning the sample, collecting 
and analysing the data will be discussed by 
<B>Christoph Schug</B> (IBM SSD Mainz, Germany). 
Finally, we will describe some practical examples.
<P>
This workshop is designed for the beginner as well as those who have 
some experience of the technique. There will be time to ask questions 
and to discuss any problems which you have encountered. 
<P>
The Physical Crystallography Group have a session on 
<A HREF="tfanalys.htm">"Thin Film Analysis"</A> 
on Wednesday morning, when you will be able to test your new skills.
