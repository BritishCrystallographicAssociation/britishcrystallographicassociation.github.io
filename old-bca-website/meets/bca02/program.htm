<P>
The format of the scientific programme at this BCA Meeting will differ
from previous years.
The sessions are based on current "hot-topics" in the field of
crystallography and cross the boundaries of the various groups of the BCA.
Most sessions are therefore organised by several groups.
There are also many parallel sessions to try and ensure that there are
interesting sessions (hopefully with no conflicts) for all delegates
throughout the conference.
<P>
There is one plenary and one parallel session on <B>New Methods of Structure
Solution and Phasing</B> covering single crystal and polycrystalline analyses.
There are also sessions on <B>Rietveld Refinement</B> and <B>Polymorphism and
Structural Changes</B>, these are areas of great activity in industry and
academia.  "Hot-topics" in the biological field include
<B>DNA Recombination and Repair</B> and the more general area of
<B>Protein Crystallography of Drugs and Disease</B>
and these both have three-hour sessions each.
<B>Detectors</B> are of interest to us all and there is a session on this topic.
<B>Thin Films</B> is a diverse area of activity and a very important
technology requiring challenging methods in analysis and
three hours are devoted to this topic.
In addition, throughout the meeting there will be a series of workshops
including <B>Thin Film Analysis</B>, <B>Amorphous Materials</B>,
<B>Powder Diffraction</B>, <B>Macromolecular Crystallisation</B>,
the <B>CCP4 Program Suite</B> and the <B>CRYSTALS Software</B>.
Also there are prize lectures and special interests groups (SIGs) on
<B>Educational Matters</B> and on the status of the <B>DIAMOND Synchrotron
Project</B>.
<P>
The posters are also a critical part of this meeting bringing a great
opportunity to discuss your latest work over a glass of wine.
All poster exhibitors will have the opportunity to give a brief oral
presentation and a chance to win one of the poster prizes.
We hope that you will find this meeting a very fruitful and enjoyable
scientific experience.

<P>
I am planning another session on "Education" for the BCA meeting in
Nottingham, and wondering what form it should take. What do you think? Are
there any burning educational issues which you think the BCA is neglecting?
Would you like to tell your fellow members about them in a short talk
lasting between 5 and 10 minutes?  If so, please send me a brief abstract,
just a sentence or two, preferably by email
(<A HREF="mailto:bca@isise.rl.ac.uk">bca@isise.rl.ac.uk</A>),
so that I can select some for
presentation. I would be delighted to see any new teaching aids you find
useful, diagrams for teaching symmetry, software new or old which your
students can use, new molecular or crystal models, etc so that I can update
the BCA list of educational resources.
<P>
I can tell you about BCA plans for an improved "educational website" aimed
at showing children and the general public something of the excitement of
crystallography or I can demonstrate the paper cut out "molecular models of
the crystal classes" which I hope to have available from the BCA Website
soon.
<P>
It has been suggested that since education affects all BCA Groups, there
might be a Special Interest Group (SIG) for those members interested in
education. We might have a regular article in "Crystallography News" on
teaching topics, such as "Designing a Winning Poster", "How I teach the
stereographic projection", "Helping students to use the International
Tables", "Teaching crystallography to Toddlers".  Is this a good idea?
Do you want a SIG?
<P>
Your ideas are welcome. Come along to the session on Monday 25 March 2002 at
17.30 or catch me at any time during the meeting to tell me about them. I
plan to submit a Poster on Education with a few of my ideas, but leave lots
of space, so come to the Poster session with an A4 page of your ideas and help
me make a better Poster.  Should a section of the Posters be devoted to
"Education"?

<P>
The structural complexity of many molecular systems offers the possibility
of many different crystal structures of a single compound.
This property of polymorphism and the associated phenomenon of
structural transformation means that the structural study of these
compounds, and the understanding of the relationship between different
forms, can be challenging.
This session will reflect the importance of undertaking
structural studies across multiple polymorphs or
structural variants in providing a complete understanding of the
behaviour of such materials.
Comprehensive structural characterisation in this area also has
significant benefits for polymorph prediction and
computer modelling which work best when an existing polymorph
is already well characterised crystallographically.
This area has important implications, for example, in developing
new pharmaceutical compounds.
The session will also reflect on the fact that in developing our
understanding of structure-property relationships and
phase transformations from one crystal form to another,
a broad range of physical characterisation techniques are
required in addition to crystallographic methods.

<FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=#FF0000><B>IG Workshop: Introduction to Thin Films
(Tutorial on Reflectometry)</B></FONT>
<P>
Tuesday 26 March, 9:00 - 10:30
<P>
Organiser: Judith Shackleton
<P>
The tutorial is designed to give a basic introduction to the analysis of
thin films. This method is often referred to as
"Glancing Incidence X-Ray Analysis (GIXA)" or
"Reflectometry".
It is used to determine the thickness, roughness, density, etc. of layers,
which are less than (about) a micron in thickness.
Typical examples are layers deposited to form electronic devices and
also optical coatings on glass.
<P>
The tutorial will be divided into three sessions:
Firstly, <B>Paul Fewster</B>, (Philips), will introduce some of the physics
behind reflectometry.
Next, the practical aspects of aligning the sample, collecting
and analysing the data will be discussed by
<B>Christoph Schug</B> (IBM SSD Mainz, Germany).
Finally, we will describe some practical examples.
<P>
This workshop is designed for the beginner as well as those who have
some experience of the technique. There will be time to ask questions
and to discuss any problems which you have encountered.
<P>
The Physical Crystallography Group have a session on
<A HREF="tfanalys.htm">"Thin Film Analysis"</A>
on Wednesday morning, when you will be able to test your new skills.

A Tutorial session in two parts:
<P>
Part I - by <B>J. M. Parker</B>, University of Sheffield.
<P>
For many purposes the diffuse X-ray scattering produced by a glassy
phase is regarded as a nuisance when trying to obtain diffraction data
from crystalline phases. However it does contain useful information
about the structure and quantity of glassy phase present, although there
are no diffraction pattern datafiles available to aid this process. In
this tutorial session methods of measuring and interpreting the
scattering from the glassy phase will be discussed and a number of case
studies of applications of these techniques presented. Finally the
application of neutron diffraction will be shown to provide additional
valuable information, complementing the results obtainable using X-rays.
<P>
Part II - by <B>G. R. Mitchell</B>, University of Reading.
<P>
Many materials exhibit structures containing both crystalline and
non-crystalline phases. A key characteristic of such semi-crystalline
materials is the degree of crystallinity. We can easily distinguish
between the scattering from the crystalline and amorphous regions of the
sample by the sharpness of the diffraction peaks. In this tutorial
session, quantitative methods of evaluating the crystalline and
amorphous fractions of these samples from x-ray scattering data will be
introduced and a number of examples which illustrate the methodology
will be followed. The relationship between the level of crystallinity or
fraction of amorphous material measured using x-ray scattering
techniques and other physical techniques will be discussed.

The CRYSTALS Workshops attached to previous BCA (and other) meetings have
proved astonishingly popular.
A similar small workshop has been scheduled for the morning of
Thursday 28 March.
The format will be the same as at Reading -
a brief presentation on new and changed features,
followed by hands-on experience of the current release
using the 20 PCs available to us.
<P>
We were a bit over-run with participants at Reading,
leading to overcrowding at the workshop.
This year there is a tick-box for the workshop on the meeting registration form.
It would be very helpful if we knew in advance how many people were planning to
attend.
<P>
Richard Cooper and David Watkin will be available throughout the
Spring Meeting to try to help new and experienced users who bring
them particular problems.
