<h1>The Dorothy Hodgkin Meeting</h1>

There will be a one day meeting at <em>the Royal Society,</em> London on 
<strong>Friday 12th July 1996 </strong> to mark the publication by the
Indian Academy of Sciences of the collected works of Dorothy Hodgkin .  It
is opportune now to hold a meeting in which we shall review the current
progress in areas of research which Dorothy started over 60 years ago as
well as looking into the future of this science.  The meeting has been
generously sponsored by the British Crystallographic Association, the Royal
Society and some pharmaceutical companies who have long been associated with
Dorothy's work and its direct impact in their fields; Glaxo-Wellcome, 
Lilly,  Roche, Novo Nordisk, Smith Kline Beecham. and  Zeneca .   The Royal
Society library will display some of Dorothy's papers during the day of the
meeting. <p>
