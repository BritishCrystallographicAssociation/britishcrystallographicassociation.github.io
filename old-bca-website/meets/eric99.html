<h2>CRYSTAL ENGINEERING:</h2>
<h2> FROM MOLECULES AND CRYSTALS TO MATERIALS</h2>
 <br>
The 28th crystallographic course at the Majorana Centre, Erice,
will be directed by Dario Braga, Bologna, Italy and A. Guy Orpen,
Bristol, UK  from <strong>May 12 to 23, 1999.</strong> <br>
<p>
This course will follow the three principal steps of crystal engineering :
 design, synthesis and evaluation.  It is intended to bring  together  those 
who have focused on the properties of crystalline materials,   analysts of
 crystal structures, supramolecular chemists and crystallographers to
 describe and discuss their views on this rapidly evolving field.
<p>
A few sessions will be organized jointly with the participants in the course
on Data Mining.

<h2>DATA  MINING  IN  CRYSTALLOGRAPHY</h2>
 <br>

The 29th crystallographic course to be held at the Majorana Centre, Erice,
from May 12 to 23, 1999, will be on the topic of "Data Mining in
Crystallography" and will be directed by Tom Blundell, Cambridge, UK and
Suzanne Fortier, Kingston, Canada.
<p>
This meeting will bring together researchers from the areas
of crystallography, informatics and machine-learning for in-depth
discussions of the fundamental concepts, methodologies and tools
of data mining. These will be illustrated through presentations of
applications in the crystallographic domain, including structure 
classification and prediction, structure-activity relationships and 
materials design.
<p>
A few sessions will be organized jointly with the participants in the
course on Crystal Engineering.
