A SHELX Workshop will take place at the University of Goettingen from
9:00 on Sept.18th to 20:00 on Sept. 23rd 2003. The Workshop will
concentrate on phasing and refinement of macromolecules and we will
attempt to provide a general introduction as well as tutorials on SHELX
and related or competitive programs; confirmed speakers and tutors
include Gerard Bricogne, Kevin Cowtan, Regine Herbst-Irmer, Duncan
McRee, Garib Murshudov, Tassos Perrakis, Thomas Schneider, George
Sheldrick, Dale Tronrud and Isabel Uson. It is not out of the question
that new additions to the SHELX program system will be released at the
Workshop.

The number of 'students' will be limited to 30. Thanks to generous
support from the EU MAXINF project, we are able to provide accommodation
(2 to a room) and some travel support. The closing date for applications
is June 1st 2003. There is no formal application form but applicants
should attach one PDF file to an email to workshop@shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de
containing name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address,
nationality, M or F, brief details of your academic qualifications and
of your research project, including (very briefly) results achieved so
far, the name of your reseach supervisor or other person who may be
consulted if necessary, and whether you wish to apply for accommodation
and travel support. All this information will be treated confidentially.
There will be opportunities for participants to present posters (if you
wish to do so, please provide a title) and to bring their own data.
Goettingen is easily accessible by high-speed train (2 hours from
Frankfurt airport).
