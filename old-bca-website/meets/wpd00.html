Course Description<br>
The course is intended for beginners as well as advanced users of powder
diffraction methods in materials, geo, physical, chemical and pharmaceutical
sciences. There are no special requirements for this course but participants
should be familiar with the principles of X-ray diffraction and
crystallography. The course will provide an overview of state of the art
methods for structure determination and refinement from powder data. After
the lectures, all participants will have the opportunity to practice on
PC’s. Examples at different levels of complexity will be provided. Your are
also welcome to bring your own datasets.
</p><p>
The lectures and exercises include:<br>
 <ul>
  <li> Data reduction (including data from high pressure, high/low
temperature experiments).
  <li> Peak fitting and intensity extraction (LeBail- and Pawley methods)
  <li> Traditional structure determination methods for powders (Direct
methods, Patterson search method)
  <li> Methods for structure determination in real space (Monte-Carlo and
simulated annealing)
  <li> Combination of structure refinement and energy minimization
  <li> The Rietveld method (including the use of soft constraints and rigid
bodies)
  <li> Fourier analysis versus maximum entropy
