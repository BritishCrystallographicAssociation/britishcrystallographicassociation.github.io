<h2>&quot;X-rays and Diamonds&quot;</h2>
<p>
<h3>Andrew R. Lang, H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol</h3>
<p>
Kathleen Lonsdale's X-ray studies of diamonds were marked by originality and insight,
as was typical of her work.  Two lines of experimentation she pursued,
photography of the anomalous <i>spike</i> diffuse reflexions and of divergent-beam (Kossel)
diffraction patterns, are still under productive development.  Other avenues for
improved experimentation on diamond have opened up since her lifetime, most notably
the use of synchrotron radiation, which has made possible several novel X-ray experiments
with diamonds.  Important is the <i>topographic</i> approach in understanding the varied
diffraction behaviour of diamonds; and scientific benefit accrues from combining this
with other spatially sensitive characterization techniques.  An early link with optical
microscopy showed that the beautiful triangular pyramidal pits, <i>trigons</i>, on diamond
octahedral surfaces were natural dislocation etch pits.  Correlating both normal and <i>spike</i>
reflexion topographs with patterns of optical absorption and cathodoluminescence emission
gives data on size and number density of the <i>platelet</i> defects that generate the <i>spikes</i>.
X-ray and cathodoluminescence topography complement each other in growth-sector mapping in
natural and synthetic diamonds, the X-rays revealing growth-sectorial dependence of lattice
defect content, and, via synchrotron X-ray double-crystal topography, of lattice parameter also.
Dynamical diffraction phenomena are well demonstrated by the more perfect diamonds; for example,
a new manifestation of coherent n-beam diffraction was recently encountered during experiments
with a modern version of Lonsdale's divergent-beam technique. (<a HREF="#top">Top of this page</a>).

<h2>&quot;Gordon Cox, Leeds and the increasing power of X-ray Structural
Analysis&quot;</h2>
<h3>Prof. D. W. J. Cruickshank (U.M.I.S.T.,Manchester M60 1QD)</h3>

Sir Gordon Cox died in June 1996 at the age of 90.
His crystallographic career lasted from 1927, when he joined Sir
William Braggs group at the Royal Institution, to 1960 when he left the
University of Leeds to become Secretary of the Agricultural Research
Council. In the years just after the end of World War II, Leeds was a
hive of crystallographic activity.  Besides Cox's large group in
Chemistry, there were W. T. Astbury in Biomolecular Structure, G. W.
Brindley in Physics and H. J. Woods  in Textiles.  I arrived in Leeds
in 1946 just in time for the post-Congress Symposium of, what may be
called, the zeroth Congress of the International Union of
Crystallography.
<p>
I will discuss some key events in the progress of X-ray
structure analysis between 1912 and the present day, but with
particular emphasis on those between 1927 and 1960.  In 1927
two-dimensional Fourier syntheses had yet to be applied in structure
analysis.  By 1960 electronic computers were no longer novel.  In 1997
we are in an era of synchrotrons and nanosecond time-resolved protein
crystallography.
<p>
Topics to be mentioned will include:
<dt>- W. L. Braggs wonderful advance from sodium chloride to lysozyme
<dt>- Coxs work at Birmingham on sugars, vitamin C and coordination compounds
<dt>- Astbury,and his reaction to Paulings alpha helix
<dt>- pioneer three dimensional Fourier syntheses and the wagging tail of
geranylamine
<dt>- programming the first electronic digital computers
<dt>- the discovery of the librational effect by cooling the crystallographer plus
crystal
<dt>- estimating the precision of small molecules in 1949 and of proteins in 1997
<dt>- the moon is not made of cheese- the white radiation Laue method of Ewald,
Nishikawa, Wyckoff and Pauling
<dt>- synchrotrons and nanosecond time-resolved protein crystallography.

<h1><a name="hodgkin">The Dorothy Hodgkin Prize and Lecture</a></h1>
<p>
The Dorothy Hodgkin Prize has been awarded to Professor Michael Woolfson who will deliver the following
lecture:
<h2>&quot;From Rock Salt to Viruses&quot;</h2>
<p>
Early structure solutions of simple materials depended on crude
trial-and-error methods. The introduction of the Patterson function
enabled larger structures to be solved although success often depended on
individual insights. The process of solving small-to-medium-size
structures was automated by the development of direct methods while, in
parallel, the multiple-isomorphous-replacement method led to spectacular
progress in protein crystallography. The availability of synchrotron
sources together with very sophisticated instrumentation for data
collection is making multiple-wavelength anomalous scattering an
increasingly-used technique for solving proteins. Current attempts to
solve proteins by ab initio methods have so far met with limited success
and the theoretical reasons for this wil be discussed.
