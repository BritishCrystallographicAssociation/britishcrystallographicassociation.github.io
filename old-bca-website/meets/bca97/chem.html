<H2>Area Detectors</H2>

<DT>Recent years have seen a rapid development of area detectors for use
in chemical crystallography with both standard laboratory and synchrotron
X-ray sources. Systems based on TV technology, image plates, and CCD chips
are now being routinely used in many crystallography laboratories in the
U.K. and around the world. The opportunities for faster and more precise
data collection presented by such devices are considerable, but the associated
problems are not negligible and there is scope for much more development
and improvement in the detectors themselves and in their use. Two half-day
sessions on area detectors at the 1997 BCA Spring Meeting are particularly
timely.&nbsp;</DT>

<P>The Monday afternoon session is not in parallel with any other. It will
include a main plenary lecture reviewing the topic as a whole, a series
of presentations under a common title by users of various types of area
detector system, and a time of discussion led by a panel. The CCG AGM will
be held at the end of this session.&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Tuesday morning session will consist of a number of more specialised
applications of area detectors in chemical crystallography. The session
will end with the now traditional Oral Poster session, in which poster
authors will be asked to give an extremely short advertisement for their
posters.&nbsp;</P>
