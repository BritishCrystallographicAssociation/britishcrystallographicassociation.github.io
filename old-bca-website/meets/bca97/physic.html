The development of diffraction from a static to a 'dynamic' probe of structural
changes has been greatly enhanced in recent years by improvements in specimen
environment for in situ variation of sample conditions, and by increases in
flux available from both X-ray and neutron sources.  The PCG session at the
1997 BCA Spring Meeting in Leeds will focus on work in time-dependent
diffraction using X-rays and neutrons.  Applications reviewed will reflect the
range of both science and timescales in time-dependent diffraction: among the
materials to be discussed are ferroelectric systems, high Tc superconductors,
minerals and biological molecules, while the timescales under consideration
range from the microsecond to the several minute or several hour range.
<p>
One of the two sessions is being organised jointly with the Neutron Scattering
Group of the Institute of Physics/Royal Society of Chemistry, which has kindly
offered a prize for the best neutron-related poster presented at the Leeds BCA
meeting (in any of the subject areas).
