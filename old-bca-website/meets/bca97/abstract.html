<DT>The scope of X-ray crystal structure analysis has improved greatly
with the evolution of better detectors.&nbsp; Different technologies have
sought to combine the 2-D nature of photographic film and the sensitivity
and 'on-line' nature of the scintillation counter.&nbsp; Different detectors
utilise different physical mechanisms to record the X-ray reflections.&nbsp;
The multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC) uses an absorbing gas and delay
line electronics for coordinate encoding of each X-ray photon.&nbsp; The
solid state TV and charge coupled device (CCD) use a sensitive phosphor
and charge scanning with analogue to digital (AD) readout.&nbsp; Image
plates (IPs) record the signal via colour centres followed by a laser scan
and also AD readout. The devices have various strengths, where no single
detector offers an ideal performance over all parameters.&nbsp; Important
parameters include detector quantum efficiency (DQE), dynamic range, number
of resolution elements (derived from the aperture size, point spread factor
and pixel size), readout time and wavelength range capability.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>Novel opportunities have arisen for structure analysis with these devices.
Several examples, especially involving synchrotron radiation, will be given.&nbsp;
An 0.94A resolution study of the 25kDa protein concanavalin A has become
possible.&nbsp; This involved use of intense synchrotron radiation and
a fibreoptic type CCD, where the DQE proved critical to make good measurements
beyond 1.05A resolution, compared with the use of an IP on the same beam.&nbsp;
However, four crystals were needed, although cryocooled, because of the
limited aperture of the CCD detector.&nbsp; In another study the CCD and
an intense 0.5A wavelength synchrotron beam, as well as cryocooling, proved
effective in extending the resolution of an octahexylphthalocyanine to
0.8A resolution, compared with 1.2A with a rotating anode CuKa single counter
diffractometer.&nbsp; Anomalous dispersion applications at multiple wavelengths
highlight the need not only for precise measurements but also fast and
automatic read out, e.g. from online IP or CCD devices, as multiple data
sets are measured.&nbsp; Examples of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion
(MAD) studies of a brominated oligonucleotide, a selenomethionine labelled
protein, manganese concanavalin A and mixed metal aluminophosphates will
be given.&nbsp; In a final category of examples the advantage of fast readout
greatly improves perturbation and dynamical crystallography studies.&nbsp;
The determination of the space group transition temperature of the octahexylphthalocyanine
liquid crystal referred to above will show the complementary characteristics
of a fast readout CCD and a large aperture, but slower readout IP.&nbsp;
A time-resolved Laue diffraction study of the K59Q slow mutant of hydroxymethylbilane
synthase and its enzymatic reaction in the crystal will be described based
on a large aperture and fast readout image intensified type CCD.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>For the present many new opportunities exist then to harness the current
generation of detector devices. Further device development will involve
mosaic CCDs to provide increased aperture for the fibreoptic type CCD;
parallel readout IP scanners to speed up these devices; novel pressurised
MWPCs e.g. for use at longer wavelengths in protein microcrystal data collection;
and finally the 'pixel detector', with readout electronics for each individual
pixel, ideal for harnessing the highest count rates for fast data collection
either in genome related structure studies or fast time-resolved work.

<DT>The time required for data collection for single crystals may be cut&nbsp;
drastically by use of an area detector diffractometer. Typically&nbsp;
6-15 hours are needed as opposed to several days with a conventional&nbsp;
four-circle diffractometer. This study analyses the quality of&nbsp; results
obtained using each method of intensity data acquisition. A comparison
is presented of X-ray structures whose data collections&nbsp; have been
made on both three-circle area detector (Siemens SMART)&nbsp; and four-circle
(Siemens P4) diffractometers. Samples for analysis&nbsp; were chosen so
as to represent a range of small molecule crystal&nbsp; types: organics,
organometallics; different crystal systems and&nbsp; crystal qualities.
Methods of absorption correction were compared&nbsp; for data collected
on both diffractometer types. In common with&nbsp; other studies involving
comparisons of data sets, the quality of&nbsp; each structure analysis
was evaluated by examining the crystal and&nbsp; intensity data, refinement
parameters and also the data collection&nbsp; conditions. Data have been
analysed using a variety of statistical&nbsp; techniques (including normal
and half-normal probability plots) on&nbsp; intensity data, coordinate
and displacement parameters and&nbsp; uncertainty estimates.&nbsp;</DT>

<H2>Badly diffracting crystals and large molecules</H2>

<H4>Dr Harry Powell,&nbsp; Automation Office, University Library, West
Road, Cambridge.&nbsp;</H4>

<DT>Area detectors in the laboratory rather than at a synchrotron offer
the crystallographer the opportunity to collect data on samples which would
previously have been rejected. The principal reasons for this lie in the
ability to collect many data simultaneously; the implications of this will
be discussed with reference to a number of data collections and structure
determinations performed in the Chemistry Department in Cambridge, none
of which would have been attempted with a conventional four-circle diffractometer.
The examples range from a small organometallic through large organic species,&nbsp;
main group and transition metal clusters, to synthetic &quot;biological&quot;
molecules.</DT>

<DT>A new high-flux single-crystal diffraction facility, designated as
Station 9.8, has been constructed at the Synchrotron Radiation Source,
CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, for use in chemical and materials crystallography.&nbsp;
X-rays in the wavelength range are selected and focused by a bent triangular
silicon monochromator and glancing-angle palladium-coated mirror, to achieve
a highly collimated beam of size similar to, or smaller than, those generally
used from conventional sources, but several orders of magnitude more intense.&nbsp;
An Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer with scintillation detector is available
for single-reflection measurements, and a Siemens SMART CCD detector with
three-circle goniometer is installed for rapid data collection in most
cases. Low-temperature facilities (Oxford Cryostream) are in routine use;
high-temperature and high-pressure experiments are planned.&nbsp; Provision
for sample handling includes a Schlenk line for air-sensitive materials
and a high-power microscope with micromanipulator for very small crystals.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>In six weeks of available beam time to date, a wide variety of samples
has been studied, provided by several research groups.&nbsp; They include
organic, inorganic, and organometallic compounds; molecular, supramolecular,
polymeric, and microporous structures; medium to weak diffractors, very
small and thin plate crystals, most of which are not amenable to examination
with conventional laboratory X-ray equipment.&nbsp; Some samples previously
rejected as unsuitable for area detector systems with rotating-anode X-rays
have been successfully characterised, with fully refined structures of
publishable quality.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>A selection of results will be presented, together with a description
of the station, and prospects for its future development, use and availability.</DT>

<H2>SOLVING MORE DIFFICULT STRUCTURES USING CCD TECHNOLOGY.</H2>

<H4>Mark R.J. Elsegood, Department of Chemistry, The University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 7RU, UK.</H4>

<DT>No matter what the era and state of data collection technology there
have always been limits as to what size of crystal or type of structure
can be determined. The limits may be set by a number of factors including
available X-ray flux, detector sensitivity, crystal sensitivity, software
development and a host of others.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>We have recently experienced the transition from one era to another
as technology has advanced so radically as to significantly push back the
fontiers of samples amenable to study. This transition involves the use
of area detector technolgy, in this case Charge Coupled Device (CCD) technology,
as as it has begun to replace the use of single point scintillation counters.
The CCD detector offers considerably enhanced sensitivity, resulting in
weaker data being measured more accurately. Having an area detector additionally
results in data being acquired very rapidly with the inherant advantages
of, often huge, data redundancy. A hemisphere of data is typically collected
in 6-15 hours.</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>The talk will specifically aim to present results obtained over the
past two years using the new technolgy where we firmly believe results
would not have been achieved using a conventional 4-Circle instrument with
a single point counter. These samples range from large polyoxometallate
and calixarene species with nearly 200 non-H atoms in the asymmetric unit,
to samples with awful reflection profiles, to tiny crystals with weak scattering
characteristics, to highly sensitive crystals containing substantial solvent
of crystallisation, to those cursed by substantial disorder, or indeed
a combination of these.</DT>

<H2>Systematic Data Errors and their Correction</H2>

<H4>Dr. N.W. Alcock, University of Warwick&nbsp;</H4>

<DT>After many years of experience, achieving good data on four-circle
diffractometers has become reasonably routine.&nbsp; This is not yet&nbsp;
true for area detectors, and this talk examines some of the&nbsp; problems
and some solutions.&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>The principal problem is absorption, and neglect of it can&nbsp; produce
very obvious effects in the final structure.&nbsp; Both&nbsp; straightforward
absorption by the crystal and absorption by the&nbsp; mounting materials
need to be considered.&nbsp; It seems that the latter&nbsp; in particular
may be reduced by careful crystal mounting and&nbsp; perhaps by the data
collection strategy.&nbsp; Precise correction for&nbsp; crystal absorption
(analytical or Gaussian) is, of course, possible&nbsp; in principle.&nbsp;
However, it seems that no program to do this for area detector data has
yet been widely distributed.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp; new experimental
techniques, such as oil-drop mounting, make it&nbsp; more difficult to
determine precise crystal dimensions. When absorption is moderate, correction
of area detector data&nbsp; for both types of absorption by a ‘psi-scan’
procedure is very&nbsp; powerful, because reflections are sampled with
substantial&nbsp; redundancy in many diffraction directions.&nbsp; Although
this procedure&nbsp; affects the physical reality of the refined thermal
parameters&nbsp; (because of uncertainty about the theta-dependence of
the&nbsp; correction), it provides a good procedure in cases where absorption&nbsp;
is not critical.&nbsp; The post-refinement pseudo-correction procedures&nbsp;
(‘DIFABS’, etc.) have the same severely adverse effects with area&nbsp;
detectors as with four-circle data; their application is probably&nbsp;
never justifiable, because of the effectiveness of the psi-scan&nbsp; method.&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>The ideal, for which the routine procedures still have to be&nbsp;
developed, is the application of an analytical or Gaussian&nbsp; correction
to a well-measured crystal, followed by a psi-scan&nbsp; correction to
remove the small additional non-crystal absorption.&nbsp;</DT>

<h2>Coping with the flood of results </h2>
<H4>J.E. Davies, (University of Cambridge), &nbsp;</H4>

<DT>With the advent of area detectors, the time taken to collect a small-molecule
dataset can be drastically reduced: two to three datasets per day are&nbsp;
possible if suitable crystals are available.&nbsp; But this increase in
data-collection efficiency can cause problems elsewhere ....</DT>

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>'<I>Even now, the majority of single-crystal structures are not accessible
in the databases because they have not yet been published.&nbsp; The barriers
to publication include lack of time to prepare the publication; lack of
desire to publish because the structure is not 'good enough' but the chemistry
is adequately determined; or the compound is proprietary.&nbsp; To address
this, worldwide electronic deposition of unpublished data, with validation&nbsp;
safeguards, must be strongly encouraged</I>.'&nbsp; R.A. Sparks et al.

<DT>&nbsp;</DT>

<DT>Although direct deposition is the most likely solution to this ever-growing
problem, very few structures enter databases via this route.&nbsp; Attempts
to directly-deposit some structures will be described and some serious
problems with existing direct-deposit mechanisms will be highlighted.</DT>

<H2>Use of the whole diffraction pattern</H2>
<H4>Prof M.B. Hursthouse (University of Cardiff)</H4>
<DT>Over the last seven years we have demonstrated in some detail the 
enormous scope for small molecule work provided by use of a "thin-
slice" area detector diffractometers (successful structure
determinations now in excess of 2000). In addition to the possibility 
of rapid data collections of a few hours for routine samples, 
additional special applications have been data collections for small 
crystals, structures with large unit cells and crystals grown from 
liquids, and data collections for charge density studies (more than a 
dozen now completed).</DT>
<DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DT>More recently we have been concentrating on procedures which
capitalise on the possibility of full recording of reciprocal
space to tackle other problems such as twins (and triplets etc), diffuse
scattering, diffraction patterns from deformed crystals, incommensurate
phases etc. to extract useful structural information. The results of
some of these studies will be described.</DT>

radiation)</FONT>.Additionally, symmetry equivalent data are also needed
to improve statistics. These experimental conditions give rise to a large volume
of data and, using a single-point detector, the data collection times can be 
as long as three months. It would therefore represent a great saving in time
if an area detector could be utilised for these experiments.
<DT>&nbsp;</DT>
<DT>To assess the feasibility of using an area detector, a model compound was chosen
for which high resolution data collected on a single-point detector was available
for comparison. A series of experiments were performed to optimise the data
collection strategy. The results of these initial experiments will be presented.
