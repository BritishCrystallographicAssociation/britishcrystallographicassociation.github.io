<h3>Tuesday 15 April, 2-5pm</h3>

<h2>Big Screen demonstration of CAMERON/CRYSTALS/SIR suite of programs.</h2>
	This suite of programs running on PCs give you fully interactive
computing for all your crystallographic needs, from data reduction to final cif
tables and publication quality diagrams. The powerful crystallographic routines
are supported by integrated graphical structure editing and pre-packaged
procedures for dealing with routine structures. A vast array of tools are
available for dealing with non-routine structures, including twinning and
pseudo-syummetry.
<p>
<b>Do you have a problem structure?</b>

<br>The demonstration, which will be given by Dr David Watkin, is interactive and
uses a PC connected to an overhead projection facility. If you have a structure which may
be a challenge to these programs (eg. twin, pseudo-symmetry, won't solve, requires unusual
restraints, doesn't refine properly etc etc) and <b>you have registered for the
conference</b> send the relevent data to David (E-mail <a href="mailto:david.watkin@chemical-crystallography.oxford.ac.uk">david.watkin@chemical-crystallography.oxford.ac.uk</a>). He (and the SIR team) has agreed
to have a crack at it and, if suitable, will use it as part of the demonstration.
