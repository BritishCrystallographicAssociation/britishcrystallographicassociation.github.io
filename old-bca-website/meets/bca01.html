<P><B>Location and Travel</B>
<br>The University of Reading is located about 3 miles from the city centre at
Whiteknights Park. Traffic in that area can be congested, you are advised
to use Public Transport. The Main Railway station has good connections to
London and the West. Heathrow International airport is easily reached using the
'Railink'  buses which take about 45 minutes from the railway station.
Gatwick airport is bestreached by train, it takes about an hour from Reading
to Gatwick.</p>
<p>General information about The University of Reading is at
URL<a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk">http://www.reading.ac.uk/</a>.
<p>Travel information and maps can be found at
URL:<a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/Maps/home.html">http://www.www.reading.ac.uk/Maps/home.html</a>
which gives details of the regular bus service to the campus from central
Reading.
Rail timetables can be found at
<a href="http://www.rail.co.uk/ukrail/planner/planner.htm">UK rail</a>.</p>
<p><B>Scientific Programme</B><br>As at previous meetings, the meeting opens
with a <B>Plenary</B> sessionon Saturday with
speakers from each of the BCA interest groups. This year the Plenary session
will be on the topic of <B><I>Visualisation</I></B>.  It will be followed by
a short discussion on <strong>Education,</strong> where you can put forward
your ideas on what the BCA should be
doing to educate the general public and school children.<br>
<br>This year there is a <strong>Bragg Lecture</strong> to be given
by<strong>Professor David Stuart,</strong> <em> Oxford University</em>just
after the BCA AGM and before the Conference Dinner on Monday.
Details of the history of the Bragg lecture and of past lecturers can
be found on the
<a href="http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/CNews/Spe97/namel.html#Bragg">BCA Web
site. </a><br><br> On other days sessions from the interest groups will run in
parallel, the CCG and PCG workshops are on Monday afternoon, the IG workshops
are on Sunday and Monday.
<P>The individual session themes are as follows:<br>
<dl>
<DT>BSG Biological Structures Group
<DD>(1) How MAD can you get?

<LI>Saturday - Evening reception at the
<a href="http://www.readingmuseum.org">Museum of Reading</a> in the citycentre.
Buses will be provided. Cost is included in the registration fee, but we need
to know numbers so that we can hire enough buses. Please mark the Registration
Form to tell us. <br><br> Delegates will have the opportunity to view some of
the Museum's galleries at leisure, whilst enjoying a drinks reception and
finger buffet. We will be in the atrium area with Roman mosaics found at
Silchester about 10 miles south of Reading, and plenty of 'hands on' exhibits
for crystallographers to enjoy. You can find out more about the excavations
<a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/la/silchester">by clicking here.</a><br>
<br>The Museum is less than 5 minutes walk from the main railway station, why
not call in again on the way home on Tuesday to see the sanitised replica of
the 'Bayeux Tapestry' beautifully stitched by prudish Victorian ladies; see
if you can spot the differences from the original.
<br><br>Oscar Wilde died just over 100 years ago in November 1900, he wrote
a famous poem <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/major/reading.htm">The
Ballad of Reading Gaol</a>. The Gaol itself is not far from the station
but is not open to visitors.
<P>
<LI>Sunday - Posters and Exhibition evening with wine reception for a
more relaxed feel.
<P>
<LI>Monday - Conference dinner and Drinks

<a name="Why"><HR NOSHADE></a>
<h3>Why you should come to Reading</h3><p>Come and hear
the latest research results on all aspects of crystallography, learn about
progress on new national facilities, meet old friends and chat about the
good old days.  These things are part of any BCA meeting, but this one in
Reading is really special because of its location.
<P>Reading is the County town of Royal Berkshire, you can see Windsor Castle on
the skyline from the airport coach. Reading boasts the remains of one of
England's largest and richest abbeys, the burial place of Henry I.
The town grew rapidly in Victorian times on a diet of beer and biscuits, the
major employers being Simmonds Brewery and Huntley &amp; Palmer
biscuit manufacturers. It now has a thriving business community and is seen as
a town of the future, being adjacent to the  'Silicon Valley of the UK',
the'M4 corridor', where many new 'high tech' industries are located. The
University of Reading is a leading International Research Institution; its
academic roots were established approximately 100 years ago.
<BR>It lies in the heart of the Thames Valley, with excellent rail
communications, just 40 miles from London with an hourly Railair coach link
from Heathrow airport to Reading railway station (journey time 45 minutes).
Further information about the University of Reading can be found on the
website:  <B><a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk">http//www.reading.ac.uk</a> </B>
or for useful local informationabout the Chemistry Department look at
<strong><a href="http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk">http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk</a></strong>
<P><B>The Whiteknights Campus</B>
<P>The BCA Spring Meeting will take place in the Conference Centre, situated in
the Palmer Building on the Whiteknights campus, 300 acres of parkland around
Whiteknights Lake, near to the fascinating Museum of Rural Life which is
well worth a visit if you can bear to miss any of the exciting Scientific
Programme arranged for you.  The Campus is less than 10 minutes from Reading
City Centre by taxi and there are frequest buses from the main railwaystation.
<p>So come and learn something new, meet more crystallographers and of course,
enjoy the meeting.</p>
