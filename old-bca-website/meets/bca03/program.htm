<P>
The scientific sessions for the 2003 BCA Meeting will continue last year's
emphasis on "hot-topics" in the field of crystallography.
The programme will cover a large range of interesting sessions including
<B>High Through-put, Databases and Data Mining</B>, which is the topic of the
3&nbsp;hour plenary session and two 4.5&nbsp;hour parallel sessions, which
should be of interest to all groups.  These sessions will form the basis for
the 2003 BCA Review Symposium issue of Crystallography Reviews.
Crystallography is very important in the advancement of technology (e.g. in
the area of magnetic, optical, semiconductor materials) and there is a
3&nbsp;hour session on <B>Crystallography for Technology</B> this year.
To probe materials deep into the bulk there are advantages in using
<B>High Energy Diffraction</B> and 3&nbsp;hours are devoted to this subject.
Crystallography has always been concerned with the molecular structure and
when a good single crystal cannot be grown powder diffraction is the only
feasible method, so again in York we will have sessions on <B>Structure
Solution from Powders</B> (3h) and a <B>Discussion on the Rietveld Method</B>
(1h). <B>Quantitative Phase Analysis</B> is a very important tool for
industry, e.g. for the analysis of cement and metal ores,
and there are 6&nbsp;hours covering this subject.
We have sessions on the complexities of modeling and
interpreting data from structures with more than one independent formula unit
<B>Structures with Z'>1</B> (1.5h) and the advances in the use of
<B>Synchrotron Radiation</B> (1.5h) for structure determination.
<P>
At York there is a <B>Max Perutz Memorial Lecture</B> to be given by Venki
Ramakrishnan and also the long established prize lectures.  As usual we are
also running workshops at this conference with more interactive presentations
on <B>Introduction to Powder Diffraction</B> (1.75h) and a series on
<B>Phase Identification</B> (4h).
There are also workshops on the <B>CCP4</B> (1.5h) and the
<B>CRYSTALS</B> (3h) software.
Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are an important part of the BCA activities and
the new <B>DIAMOND SIG</B> (0.75h) is becoming established along with the
<B>Education SIG</B> (0.75h).
The posters, as always, are an important part of the BCA conference and as
usual to give greater coverage we will be running the popular
<B>Oral Poster</B> session and in the evening you can scrutinize the
<B>Posters</B> (3h) with a glass of wine in your hand!
<P>
Much of the activity in the world of crystallography is covered by this
conference and with its new condensed format this is an event you should
not miss!

The conference is opened with the plenary session and there are four speakers
covering aspects of "High Throughput, Databases and Data Mining".
<P>
Crystallography has moved a long way from its early days of lengthy structure
solutions and database searching with books, etc.
Now all crystallographic activities benefit from rapid computer searching
and fast data collection and this has lead to quite different ways of working
and of course the automation of the growth and selection of crystals.
Rapid data collection methods eventually create vast databases of structures
that can benefit drug design, for example, by rapid search for structural
analogues.
The databases and extracting the right data (data mining) has now become a
very important topic.  The identification of structural phases by X-ray
diffraction has long been an important tool and building quality databases is
an essential part.  This session will cover aspects of rapid data collection
and handling large quantities of data, the use of databases and the use of new
synchrotron diffraction methods capable of simultaneously monitoring multiple
grains within a single bulk sample as a function
of time, temperature and 3 dimensional space.

Powder Diffraction is widely used for identifying phases of polycrystalline
materials and is a widely used technique in many industries and academe.
This session introduces the Phase Identification Workshop by explaining some
of the fundamentals of the technique so that those who are not fully
versed in the method, will gain the necessary background to get maximum
benefit from the Wednesday sessions.

This modular workshop, which follows on from the Introduction to Powder
Diffraction session, has emphasis placed on the practical use of powder
diffraction phase identification.
The modules are linked to give a good grounding in best practice for phase
identification and are suitable for both novice and experienced
practitioners. You can choose to attend any of the modules that fit into your
meeting schedule.
For those who attend all the sessions an optional certificate of attendance
is available for your professional development file.
<P>
The purpose of this workshop is to build proficiency in the interpretation of
experimental powder data, especially in the application of the
Powder Diffraction File (PDF) and new relational databases.
On the type of information the database contains: its history; the way this
information is organised; how data may be retrieved and interpreted;
how to collect experimental data; how interpretation is affected by accuracy
of experimental data; how to detect and understand common
instrumental and specimen induced errors; how new relational databases
extend search options.  Hands-on work sessions will allow you to become
familiar with the application of both printed and computer
media to phase identification.

The science and methods of crystallography are widely applied across 
disciplines for the investigation of materials with technological applications, 
both potential and realized. Our aim is to demonstrate the 
widespread and continuing importance of crystallography and its methods to 
current materials research through a varied programme of talks, 
which are intended to be accessible and interesting to the wider 
audience of the BCA. This session brings together in the programme a 
number of expert speakers who are united by their use of diffraction 
and scattering methods to address problems in the physics and 
chemistry of technologically important materials.

"Structures having more than one independent formula unit are interesting
because they are unusual; only 8% of the structures in the CSD have Z'&gt;1 and
fewer than 1% have Z'&gt;2.
In some Z'&gt;1 structures the pseudosymmetry is so
strong that the structures are best described as modulated;  in others the
molecules have such different orientations and/or conformations that an
analogy can be made with co-crystals.
Because Z'&gt;1 structures are exceptional they can provide new insights into
crystal packing.
They also present interesting technical problems.  As a group these structures
are wonderful and informative puzzles that too often remain unpublished.
Consideration of Z'&gt;1 structures is timely because anecdotal evidence
suggests they are more likely to be recognized when a CCD or image-plate
detector are used." Professor Carolyn P. Brock, Department of Chemistry,

Quantitative Phase Analysis is a very powerful X-ray diffraction analysis tool
and is widely used in many industries from pharmaceuticals to cement.
There is a range of methods from the comparison of peak intensities of
different phases through to full profile fitting.  Complexities of texture,
micro-absorption and for some methods finding suitable pure phases for
standards.  This will lead on from the Phase Identification Workshop,
i.e. now I know how to find what phases I have: what is proportion of each in
my sample?

The ability to perform full structure solutions from powder diffraction data
has perhaps been one of the most significant crystallographic advances of the
past decade.
Continuing advances in computational methodologies mean that structures of
increasing complexity can be successfully tackled by powder methods.
In this joint session between the CCG and the PCG the speakers will highlight
how a variety of different approaches (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms,
combined annealing and refinement) of different data (lab/synchrotron X-rays,
time-of-flight and constant wavelength neutrons) can be used to target both
molecular and extended systems of pharmaceutical and technological relevance.

The CRYSTALS Workshops attached to previous BCA (and other) meetings have 
proved astonishingly popular.  
A similar workshop has been scheduled into the York meeting.  
It will include a brief presentation on new and changed features, followed by 
hands-on experience of the current release using up to 69 PCs available to us.
