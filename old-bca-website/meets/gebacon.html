<hr>
<BIG>In 1997, there was a ground swell of opinion within the neutron 
scattering community that something should be done to mark the 80th birthday 
of George Bacon.</BIG>

<P>
<BIG>George built the first neutron diffractometer in the U.K. at 
A.E.R.E., Harwell and used it in the first neutron diffraction experiments to 
be performed outside the U.S.A. </BIG>
<P>
<BIG>He publicised the advantages of neutron scattering to the scientific 
community and therefore laid the foundation for the present community of 
neutron scatterers in the U.K. which arguably holds a pre-eminent position 
in the world. </BIG>

<P>
<BIG>George was the author of the classic text "Neutron Diffraction" 
(Oxford University Press). This seminal volume ran into three editions and 
was essential introductory reading on the topic for many of today's leading 
neutron scatterers.</BIG>

<P>
<BIG>The title of this meeting is perhaps not very original, - since it is
 almost identical to that used for the book </BIG>
<P>
<BIG>"50 Years of Neutron Diffraction" which George was commissioned to 
write (as a companion to the earlier histories of X-ray and electron 
diffraction), by the International Union of Crystallography.</BIG>
<P>
<BIG>The title is nevertheless highly appropriate, since it was in 1947, 
at the age of 30, that George made his first neutron measurements with 
monochromator crystals at GLEEP at A.E.R.E., Harwell.</BIG>

<P>
<BIG>The organisers of this meeting are pleased to announce that the 
Council of the University of Sheffield has recently agreed to confer the 
Honorary Degree of DSc on Emeritus Professor George Bacon as </BIG>
<P>
<BIG>"an acknowledged pioneer and one of the most respected names in the 
field of neutron scattering."</BIG>
