These things are part of any BCA meeting, but thisone in Reading is really special because of its location.<br><strong> Visit the birth place of a famous crystallographer!</strong><P>Reading is the County town of Royal Berkshire, you can see Windsor Castle onthe skyline from the airport coach. Reading boasts the remains of one ofEngland's largest and richest abbeys, the burial place of Henry I.  The towngrew rapidly in Victorian times on a diet of beer and biscuits, the majoremployers being Simmonds Brewery and Huntley &amp; Palmer biscuitmanufacturers. It now has a thriving business community and is seen as atown of the future, being adjacent to the  'Silicon Valley of the UK', the'M4 corridor',  where many new 'high tech' industries are located. TheUniversity of Reading is a leading International Research Institution; itsacademic roots were established approximately 100 years ago.  <BR>It lies in the heart of the Thames Valley, with excellent railcommunications, just 40 miles from London with an hourly Railair coach linkfrom Heathrow airport to Reading railway station (journey time 45 minutes).Further information about the University of Raeding can be found on thewebsite:  <B><a href="http//www.reading.ac.uk">http//www.reading.ac.uk</a> </B>  or for useful local informationabout the Chemistry Department look at <strong><a href="http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk">http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk</a></strong><P><B>The Whiteknights Campus</B><P>The BCA Spring Meeting will take place in the Conference Centre, situated inthe Palmer Building on the Whiteknights campus, 300 acres of parkland aroundWhiteknights Lake, near to the fascinating Museum of Rural Life which iswell worth a visit if you can bear to miss any of the exciting ScientificProgramme arrnaged for you.  The Campus is less than 10 minutes from ReadingCity Centre by taxi and there are frequest buses from the main railwaystation.<p>So come and learn something new, meet more crystallographers and of course, enjoy the meeting.</p><a name="Time"><hr></a><h3> Timetable</h3><p>There are three files showing the timetable,<a href="TT01A.html">a complete one, text only,</a> quicklyand easily seen by any browser, and two others which have fixed size textin images <a href="TT01L.html">Saturday, Sunday</a> or      <a href="TT01R.html">Monday, Tuesday</a>, both <em>last updated 30 October 2000.</em></p><a name="Reg"><hr></a><h3>Registration</h3><p>The last date for Early Registration is <strong>2 March 2001</strong>after that date everyone will be charged the full rate of &pound;165.00</p><strong>Early Registration Fee</strong> &pound;135.00<br><br>Students, retired and unemployed persons early Registration fee &pound;95.00</p><br>Please complete a <a href="RFM01.html">Registration Form</a> and mail it with your fees, payable in pounds sterling to the BCA Admin office,marked for the attention of Euan Woodward.<a name="Meals"><hr></a><h3>Accommodation and meals</h3><p>Three types of accommodation on campus are on offer:<ol>  <li>(&pound;23.00 per night)a standard study bedroom with shared shower and toilet facilities in Whiteknights Hall  <li>(&pound;38.00 per night)study bedrooms with en-suite facilities Whiteknights Hall orSt.George's Hall (Not Saturday 7 April)  <li>(&pound;55.00 per night) Superior en-suite rooms in Black Horse House</ol>All types of accommodation include breakfast.<br><B>Please note that there are a limited number of Ensuite and Superior rooms.
