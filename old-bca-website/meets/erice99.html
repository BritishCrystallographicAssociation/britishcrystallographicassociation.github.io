Crystal engineering is an emerging field at the intersection of
supramolecular and materials chemistry. This interdisciplinary School will
address the design, modelling, synthesis, characterization, and properties
of crystalline solids.

<UL>
 <LI>crystal-directed synthetic strategies for preparation of

 <UL>
  <LI>coordination polymers and networks
  <LI>hydrogen bonded frameworks
  <LI>networks, clathrates, nano- and mesotubes
  <LI>inclusion compounds 
  </UL>
 <LI>techniques for the characterization of solid supramolecular aggregates
 <LI>non-covalent interactions between closed shellatoms
 <LI>theoretical calculations of crystal structures and properties
 <LI>biomineralization and crystal growth in biomimetic environments - 
 <LI>kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular crystals and inclusion compounds 
 <LI>crystal nucleation and growth
 <LI>applications in 
  <UL>
   <LI>optoelectronics 
   <LI>second harmonic generation
   <LI>conductivity and superconductivity
   <LI>charge-transfer and magnetism
   <LI>solid state reactivity
   <LI>nano and meso-materials
  </UL>

Applications (IN ENGLISH) must not exceed one A4 page or 50 e-mail lines and 
should include:
<P>
<ul>
  <li> a.  family name, name, age, sex, citizenship;
  <li> b.  address, phone, fax, internet/bitnet e-mail (if used);
  <li> c.  academic position and scientific interests;
  <li> d.  title or abstract of a  poster contribution  
          (if one is to be submitted)
</ul>
<P>
Young researchers should add a letter of recommendation by a senior
scientist and a list of no more than five publications (do not send
reprints). Please specify if financial support is required and justify the
amount requested. This material plus 5 (preferably self-adhesive) address
labels should be (e-) mailed by November 30, 1998 to Paola Spadon, with a
copy to Dario Braga (addresses below). Each application will be
acknowledged. The results of the selection of candidates will be mailed
before the end of December 1998.

<P>
The total fee, inclusive of board and lodging during the course, is $1,320
US. Financial support to applicants is conditional on the success of the
several applications submitted by the organizing committee to international
and national sources. Usually three times applications as there are places
are received. Early applications are therefore recommended.
