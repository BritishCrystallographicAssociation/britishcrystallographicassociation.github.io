 <p>
 The registration fee for the meeting is £150.00 (£100.00 for students).
 The Proceedings are  included in the conference fee and will be published
 in the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (JSR).  A special subscription
 rate to the JSR is offered to new subscribers.
 <p>
 For reasons of limited site capacity and visitor safety it is likely that
 attendance numbers will have to be capped.  An early response to this
 invitation is very strongly advised.

 <p>
 Posters will be selected based on the information provided on the poster
 form.  If one (or more) of your posters is selected, you will be informed
 in advance of the meeting.   Prizes will be awarded for the five best
 poster abstracts.  The prize winners will then be invited to give a short
 10 minute oral presentation of the material contained in their poster in a
 special "hot topic" session. 
 <p>
<h3> ABSTRACTS</h3>
 <p>
 We would like to invite abstracts for contributed talks.  From the
 abstracts which are submitted we will select five for oral presentation.

<h1>Cover Story - IUCr Congress, Glasgow August 4th-13th 1999 </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
The front cover of this issue of 'Crystallography News' is 
<strong><em>not</em></strong> the Sydney Opera House from an unusual
perspective, but the<strong> Clyde auditorium of the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre </strong>(SECC) where we will hold the 18th IUCr Congress
from August 4th-13th next year. (To give you a sense of scale, it is big
enough to put the Sydney opera house inside!) This building has been
affectionately christened the Armadillo by local Glaswegians, but it is
supposed to represent the upturned hull of a ship; the SECC is by the Clyde
in a district that was once the biggest shipbuilding area in the world. 

<P>
Next to it there is a hotel, and a large building which houses more lecture
theatres and our commercial exhibition. It is &frac12; mile from the city
centre with its shops, museums and fine Victorian architecture (Glasgow in
the UK City of Architecture in 1999), and, above all its welcoming friendly
people. It is a fitting place to hold what will be one of the largest
scientific meetings in Europe in 1999, and a great venue for British
crystallographers to show what they can do!

<h2>The Scientific Programme </h2>
<HR>
<P>
The Programme Committee met in Arlington for 4 days before the ACA meeting
in July, and has put together a huge programme that spans as much of
crystallography as is possible in 10 days.

 <br>
For Glasgow this means:<BR>
 <strong>96 microsymposia</strong> and <strong>32 keynote lectures</strong>
 over nine days.
 <br>
<P>
The science kicks off with workshops on the <strong>4th August</strong>. 
The main meeting starts with the opening ceremony on the evening of the 4th
when the Ewald lecture will be given. This is the IUCr's personal award,
although the prizewinner will not be known until 1999. 

<P>
The remaining days, with the exception of the excursion day, run as follows: 
<BR><BR>
there will be <strong><em>two</em></strong> parallel keynote lectures each morning from <strong>08.30 to 09.30</strong> <BR>
followed by coffee. <BR><BR>
This is followed by <strong><em>six parallel microsymposia</em></strong>
 from <strong>10.00 to 12.30. </strong>
<P>
<BR>Lunch follows for those not showing posters that day. <BR><BR>
The poster programme involves a new set of up of posters each working day. The poster area is part of the commercial exhibition as are the eating areas and 
an Internet cafe. The poster sessions run from <strong>12.30 to 15.00 </strong>
with those presenting encouraged to eat sandwiches at their posters. 

<P>
<BR>The second group of <strong><em>six parallel microsymposia </em></strong>
will run from <strong>15.00 to 17.30,</strong> and the day finishes with a 
further <strong>two keynote lectures </strong>from <strong>17.30 to 18.30. 
</strong>
<P>
<BR>The commercial exhibition stops after 10th August, and we can mount more 
posters in the final three days of the meeting. 

<P>
Two BCA named lectures are part of all this programme: 
<BR>there is the <strong>Bragg </strong>lecture on August 7th, and the 
<strong>Lonsdale </strong>lecture the same day. <strong>Jack Dunitz</strong>, a native of Glasgow, will be giving the Bragg Lecture, and 
<strong>Richard Welberry</strong> (Australian National University) will be giving the Lonsdale Lecture.

<P>
There is one evening session scheduled for Saturday 7th August. This is the
<strong> J.M.Robertson Symposium</strong>, to be organised by Professor 
<strong>Jim Trotter</strong> (University of British Columbia, Vancouver also a
 Glaswegian in exile). We hope to provide an evening buffet/wine to bridge the
 gap between the keynote lectures and this session. It is going to be quite a
 day! 

<P>
There will be sessions for the <strong>Open Commission meetings,</strong>
 but these will run in parallel with either the posters or the microsymposia
sessions in another smaller room. There will also be areas for
non-commercial software demonstrations, a press room and an accompanying
members lounge with plenty of space to sit and talk.<br><br>

 For the national committees and voting delegates, there are sessions of the 
General Assembly for the 5th, 6th, 9th, and, if necessary the 11th. These will
 run from 7.30-10pm.<br><br> 

<a name="Social"><HR></a>
<h2>The Social Programme </h2>

 It all begins with an opening ceremony full of music and pictures followed
by wine and a buffet on the evening of August 4th. On other evenings we can
offer a reception in the Kelvingrove museum on Sunday night, a whisky
tasting session, a 'blend your own whisky' session, a student mixer, an
evening at Marks and Spencer (including wine and some nibbles), and a
farewell fling and closing ceremony courtesy of Strathclyde University in
the beautiful Barony Halls on the last night, Friday August 13th. (Don't,
whatever you do, go home early!). 

<P>
On Wednesday night you can learn to dance a few easy Scottish ceilidh dances
in preparation for the conference ceilidh in the Bute Hall at Glasgow
University. The University's Hunterian museum will also be open that
evening.

<P>
A ceilidh (pronounced kay-lee) is a uniquely Scottish experience replacing
the usual conference dinner, and provides an unforgettable evening of music,
dance (who cares if you get it wrong!), food, drink and great company! The
closing ceremony is part of the farewell fling on Friday. There will also be
two excursions to east end and west end pubs. (I get tired just reading all
this!)

<P>
There will be a variety of options for the conference excursion. Currently
we expect to offer: Inverary and the Trossachs, Edinburgh, the Isle of
Arran, golf, and a geology tour. Accompanying members will be offered daily
tours that include sightseeing in Glasgow and that other place (Edinburgh),
New Lanark, Loch Lomond, a whisky distillery, and shopping. Bring along your
partner they will not be bored! There will not be a creche, but we have a
list of approved childminders who live nearby, which should be very
effective for those who need child care. 


<p>And finally, the eclipse of the sun or at least an 80% version of it. 
It will stop everything on the 11th at around 10:15. "Will it be sunny?", 
you ask, "Will I see the sun?." Oh yes (assuming you weren't on the pub visit 
the night before).

<h2>Satellites  -  what next?</h2>
<HR>
<P>
This may not be enough crystallography for some of you, so we have planned 
four satellite meetings as well: 

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Synchrotron Radiation</em>:</strong> Bob Cernick 
      is organising this at Daresbury. It is a pre-conference meeting.
  <li><strong><em>Structural and Dynamic Aspects of Molecular and Ionic Solids
   Using Neutrons</em>:</strong>   Colin Carlile at Oxford 2-3rd August. 
   <li> <strong><em>Cambridge Structural Database</em>:</strong> 
     Frank Allen at Cambridge  15th-18th August.
   <li> <strong><em>Computing School</em>:</strong> G&eacute;rard Bricogne 
    (and others at MRC) at Hinxston Hall, near Cambridge, 14th-20th August.
</ul>

<P>
Transport will be provided from Glasgow to those who need it, in order 
to get to the post-conference satellites. 
<P>
<strong>What Next?</strong>
<P>
The second announcement goes to print at the beginning of October. <BR>It
contains registration forms, accommodation information (starting as cheaply
as &pound;37 for dinner, bed and breakfast in Strathclyde University
complete with en-suite facilities), satellite registration and the full
scientific programme. It will be mailed to you in a number of ways: 
<ul>
  <li>If you filled in the pre-registration form that accompanied the 1st
   announcement, you will be mailed this directly.
  <li>Each BCA member member will also receive a copy directly.
  <li> It will also appear with the IUCr Newsletter as an insert.
</ul>
<P>
This means that you may get three copies; this is fine: please distribute
the others to colleagues and students, but above all don't miss this event.
British crystallography is on show, and we intend to demonstrate just how
good it is. Watch the web page for frequent updates:
