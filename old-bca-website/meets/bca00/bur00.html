Instructions for Applying for BCA Bursaries in 2000<BR>
</B>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Bursaries for attendance at BCA Annual Conference:</B> 
<a href="../meets/BCA00.html#Burs">see the conference details</a> on 
another page.<BR>

<P>
<B>Bursaries for attendance at other BCA Meetings or Schools:</B> <BR>
these are administered directly by the organisers of these Meetings or
Teaching Schools. They will publicise the procedure for all bursary
applications, whether they are funded by the BCA itself or by a constituent
group.<BR>

<P>
<B>General Bursaries:</B> The BCA also has funds available to provide
bursaries for members, (see point (a) below) who wish to attend other
relevant scientific meetings in the UK or abroad not organised by the BCA.
All applications are considered by the BCA Bursary Committee, comprising the
President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary and are guided by the
following considerations:

<P>
<ul>
 <li>a) The bursaries are primarily intended to support bona fide research
students and postdoctoral workers who are BCA members. Applications from
those with more senior non-tenured positions, and from those in junior
permanent positions where university or industrial funds are unavailable,
may be supported at the discretion of the BCA Bursary Committee if BCA funds
are available.
 <li>b) Applicants must normally have been a BCA member for 6 months before
 applying.
 <li>c) Applicants will not normally be considered if they have been 
awarded a general bursary in the previous two years.
 <li>d) Preference will be given to applicants who have attended a BCA
meeting. Applications must be received at least 6 weeks before the date of
the meeting/visit. No retrospective applications are possible.
 </ul><p><B>Applicants should ask for a general bursary application form
from the <a href="member.html#admin">BCA Administrative Office</a>.
</B> The application will
normally be dealt with at the end of the calendar month in which they are
received. Consideration of incomplete applications, or those requiring
clarification, may be delayed until this is received. Applications should
<I>always</I> be accompanied by a supporting statement from the supervisor
or Head of Department concerning the relevance and importance of this
meeting/visit to the applicant and their research.

<P>
Successful applicants are expected to submit a typed short scientific report
on the meeting/visit soon after their return; this should include details of
the sessions attended and of the applicant's presentation. The reports may
submitted via electronic mail and may be published later in
'<em>Crystallography News</em>'.

<P>
The largest individual grant paid in 1999 was &pound;200. The total amount
of BCA funds spent on General Bursaries during 1999 up to 1 Nov. 99 was
&pound;2,400. Full details of the General bursaries awarded will be
published in the next issue of BCA Crystallography News. <BR>
