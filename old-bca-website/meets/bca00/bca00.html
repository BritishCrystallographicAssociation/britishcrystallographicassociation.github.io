<h2> General Information </h2>
<p>
The 2000 BCA Spring  meeting begins on the morning of Monday April 3 and
ends with the Conference Dinner on Wednesday 5 April. Accommodation will be
available from Saturday night for those wishing to arrive a day early.

</p>

<P>
<B>Only late registration (after 3 March 2000) is now available.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Location and Travel</B><br>
Edinburgh Conference Centre at Heriot-Watt University is located six miles
west of the centre of Edinburgh. Situated close to the city bypass, it is
easily accessible from all routes in and out of Edinburgh. Free car and
coach parking is provided on campus; Edinburgh International Airport is just
five minutes away by car. The campus is set in beautiful landscaped park
lands with all accommodation, lectures and exhibition on site.</p>
<p> General information about Heriot-Watt University is at URL
<a href="http://www.hw.ac.uk/">http://www.hw.ac.uk/</a> while general information about Edinburgh is at <a href="http://www.efr.hw.ac.uk/EdWeb.html">

<p>
<B>Scientific Programme</B><br>
<P>
As at previous meetings, there will be a <B>Plenary</B> session on Monday with
speakers from each of the BCA interest groups. This year the Plenary session
will be on <B><I>Refinement</I></B>. On Tuesday and Wednesday, sessions from the interest
groups will run in parallel, with CCG and IG workshops on Tuesday.<BR>
<P>
The individual session themes are as follows:<br>
 <dl>
   <DT>BSG Biological Structures Group
   <DD>(1) Cellular Assemblies
   <DD>(2) Structural Genomics
   <DD>(3) Hot structures
  <DT>CCG Chemical Crystallography Group
   <DD>(1) workshop - Recent developments in software for
chemical crystallography
   <DD>(2) Crystal growth
  <DT>IG  Industrial Group
   <DD>(1) Pharmaceutical special interest group
   <DD>(2) workshop - Specimen preparation
   <DD>(3) Controlled environment X-Ray Diffraction
  <DT>PCG Physical Crystallography Group
   <DD>2) Disordered materials
 </DL>
<B>Social Programme</B>
<ul>
  <li>Monday &nbsp; - Reception at the Playfair Library in the city centre.
Buses will be provided.
  <li>Tuesday &nbsp; - Posters and Exhibition evening with wine reception
for a more relaxed feel.
  <li>Wednesday &nbsp; - Conference dinner and Drinks
</ul>

<a name="Why"><hr></a>
<h3>Why you should come to Heriot-Watt</h3>
<p>
There is something for everyone at the sessions at this year's meeting. The
program takes in practically every angle of crystallography from crystal
growing to disordered materials.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The full cost of the conference is only &pound;233, cheaper than St
Andrews in 1998! for a full BCA member staying 4 nights in standard
accommodation attending the conference dinner and the reception at the
Playfair Library. A student or retired member will pay &pound;40 less.
  <li>Find out about the latest in crystallographic instrumentation and
software. The commercial exhibition will be held with participants posters
in conference rooms around the main auditorium. More posters will be on the
main route to the second lecture theatre. There will be poster prizes too.
  <li>Come and enjoy the city of Edinburgh and beyond.  Edinburgh has many
attractions from the historical Castle and Holyrood House to the modern
Dynamic Earth as well as an extensive range of restaurants, pubs and clubs.
For peace and quiet, the Highlands begin at just over an hour away by car.
</ul>

<p>
So come and learn something new, meet more crystallographers and of course,
 enjoy the meeting.</p>

<h3>Accommodation and meals</h3>
<p>
Two types of accommodation on campus are on offer:

<ol>
  <li>a standard study bedroom with shared shower and toilet facilities
  <li>study bedrooms with en-suite facilities.
</ol>
Both types of accommodation include full Scottish breakfast.
</p>
<P>
3-course lunches will be served in a self service canteen.
This is included in the registration fee.
 Dinners will be available for those who request them in the same canteen.<BR>

<P>
The Lectern Bar, a Victorian style pub, will be open during the conference,
normal opening hours are 1700 until 2300 hrs.

<P>
The Centre for Sport &amp; Exercise is open to conference participants and
offers the latest fitness equipment, squash and badminton courts, a jogging
circuit, an all weather sports field and outdoor football and rugby pitches.

<P>
In addition, there is a general store, bank (Royal Bank of Scotland),
book shop and medical centre on campus.

<h2>Lecture and Poster Abstracts Submission</h2>

<P >
<strong>Poster </strong>contributions are invited on any aspect of
crystallography: they are an essential part of a successful meeting.  A good
poster has both high scientific content and clear presentation.  Points to
remember:  What are the main points you wish to convey?  Is the poster
eye-catching?  Is there too much text and can it be read from a few feet
away?  Poster boards are mostly 1m wide by 2m high, with a few 1.2m by 1.8m.
 Velcro fixings will be provided for each accepted poster.
<strong>There are prizes for the best poster in
each subject grouping</strong>. <P>


<P >

Abstracts should have the title in CAPITALS, followed by the author(s)
name(s) and affiliation(s).  Indicate those author(s) who will attend the
Meeting by underlining, or with an asterisk (*), e.g.: <P >

<h2>How to apply for Bursaries</h2>

<B><U>URGENT AND IMPORTANT !!</U></B><br>

<B><U>BCA Bursaries for Spring Meeting 2000, Heriot-Watt </FONT></U></B></p>

<P>
As has been the practice for previous BCA Spring Meetings, bursaries for the
Heriot-Watt event are being handled separately from the general BCA
bursaries, although the rules for eligibility are the same (see BCA
Bursaries 2000 page elsewhere in this issue). Spring Meeting bursaries can
cover registration, accommodation and the conference dinner, but not travel.

<P>
The application procedure is as follows;

<P>
Applications must be made <B>on paper</B> by sending the following to the BCA
Treasurer at the address below:
<UL>
<LI>A letter of application. This must contain the applicant's name,
institution address and other contact details, and title or copy of poster
abstract, and should state clearly whether and when BCA bursaries have been
previously received. Previous receipt of a BCA bursary award does not
disqualify application.

<LI>A signed letter of support from the supervisor / senior colleague. As a
signature is required, electronic submissions of this item will not be
accepted.

<LI>The completed Heriot-Watt registration form (to be found elsewhere in
this issue), outlining registration and accommodation requirements, and with
the amount due clearly stated. Do not send any payment with this form.

</UL>

<P>
Please note that abstracts must be submitted electronically as described
elsewhere on the web. Submission of the title or copy for a bursary
application does NOT constitute submission to the conference.

<P>
The closing date for applications is <B>January 21<SUP>st</SUP> 2000. THIS
DATE IS FINAL</B>. Applications will be considered and awards made very soon
after then by the BCA Bursary Committee. No late applications will be
considered or acknowledged. Successful applicants will be notified as soon
as possible after the closing date.

<strong>"Round-Robin" Samples</strong><br>

<P>
A number of samples are available for participants to prepare and measure in
their laboratories for comparison at the workshop. These comprise inorganic
and organic powders with a tendency to preferred orientation, a titanium
alloy for texture measurement and a coarse metal powder for lattice
parameter measurement.

<P>
This will not be a formal round-robin, but is intended to promote discussion
of techniques at the workshop. Anonymity of data from laboratories will be
maintained, unless there is prior agreement. Other short contributions and
problems for discussion will be welcome.
