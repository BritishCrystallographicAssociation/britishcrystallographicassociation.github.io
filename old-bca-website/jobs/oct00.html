<h2>Two Openings at NIST</h2>
<p>
The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), in cooperation with the
Department of Physics at the University of Maryland, is currently seeking
qualified candidates for two openings:  An Instrument Scientist for the
cold triple axis instrument (SPINS), and a postdoctoral position through
the Materials Science and Engineering Center for a person with experience
in the general area of Colossal Magnetoresistive Oxides.  Candidates with a
Ph.D in experimental condensed matter physics, and experience in triple
axis spectrometry, are preferred.  Salaries are in the range of
$40,000-$60,000 depending on qualifications and experience.
</p><p>
The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a multi-disciplinary
research  facility that provides modern neutron instrumentation for
investigations in a wide range of topics in physics, chemistry, materials
science, biology, and engineering.  The instrumentation is available
through a formal user program, through collaborative research programs with
NIST staff, and via cooperative research agreements and programs with
University scientists.   For additional information on the NCNR facilities
visit the webpage : 
<a href="http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/">http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/</a>
</p><p>
<strong>SPINS Instrument Responsible:</strong><br>
An experimental condensed matter scientist is sought for the cold
triple-axis neutron instrument. In addition to conducting independent or
collaborative research in condensed matter science, the incumbent would
share the responsibilities of assisting visiting researchers in carrying
out experiments on the NCNR's Spin Polarized Inelastic Neutron Scattering
(SPINS) spectrometer. The incumbent would be an associate of the University
of Maryland, College Park, but would be stationed at NIST, Gaithersburg,
Maryland. This is a two year, minimum, position with the University's full
benefits package.
</p><p>
<strong>Research Associate in Colossal Magnetoresisitive Oxides</strong><br>
A recent Ph.D in experimental condensed matter physics is sought, with
experience in the general area of CMR materials.  Familiarity with
triple-axis neutron spectrometry is desired, but not essential.  No formal
instrumental responsibilities are required, with the majority of the
scientist's time devoted to collaborative or independent research in the
team.  Positions are typically two to three years.</p>

<h2>Johns Hopkins University</h2>
<h3>Postdoctoral Position in Experimental Condensed Matter Physics</h3>
<p>
Candidates are sought for a postdoctoral position in the group of
Professor Collin Broholm in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the
Johns Hopkins University. We study the dynamics of strongly fluctuating
condensed matter systems using neutron scattering techniques. Systems
under investigation include low dimensional and frustrated magnets with
spin liquid phases, strongly correlated metals, and materials with unusual
lattice dynamic properties. One theme being explored is quantum
criticality at phase transitions induced by a magnetic field or pressure
at low temperatures. We are also actively studying impurities in strongly
fluctuating systems.</p>
<p> Experiments are mainly conducted at the NIST Center
for Neutron Research where the successful candidate will be stationed.
A Ph. D. degree in Physics or a related area is a requirement and prior
experience in one or more of the following areas will be an advantage:
neutron scattering, low temperature physics, instrument development, and
single crystal growth. Interest and achievements in relevant scientific
areas will also be considered as will the ability of the candidate to
mentor graduate students, and to function productively at a major
scientific facility.</p>
