<h2>Jobs in Julich </h2>

<p> There is an interesting article in Nature - 15 April issue,
 page 550.  One of Germany's national research centres, the
 Research Centre Julich, has recently advertised tenure-track
 positions exclusively for women.  The programme for female
 scientists offers three positions per year for the next three
 years, and asks explicitly for women who do not necessarily
 wish to abandon the idea of having a family.
<p>
 The Julich believe they have found a loophole in the
 legislation forbidding sex discrimination in job advertising,
 because a court has said that employers can take steps to
 promote the "realization of equality of opportunity".
<p>
 The article gives a wide-ranging discussion of the problems
 of careers in science for women in Germany, and is worth a
 look.

which is currently about £7200. This can, of course, be topped up at any
stage with industrial support, and sufficient student demonstrating is
available to ensure that all post-graduates can do a reasonable amount.
Both projects will involve solid-phase synthesis, and its application to
Combinatorial Chemistry and Catalysis, with emphasis on the use of a wide
range of analytical techniques to understand the chemistry on the polymer
support. No deadline.
<p>
I also have another industrially-funded (by British Petroleum) PhD
studentship available (start date: October 1st 1999), also at King's
College London. Same details as above. The deadline for application for
