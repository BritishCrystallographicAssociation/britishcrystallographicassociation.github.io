<h2>Molecular Modelling Position at Biogen</h2>
<p>

We have an immediate opening for a molecular modeling position at Biogen in
Cambridge Mass, USA.
<p>
We are looking for a computational chemist to be involved in the
applications of programs for diversity analysis, combinatorial chemistry
and QSAR analysis.   The position will focus mainly on the application of
tools to analyze chemical diversity for our HTS and combinatorial chemistry
efforts, build statistical models that describe  structure-activity
relationships and use these models to design new drug candidates.  The
position will also have a minor component involving the development of
programs to help automate our modeling procedures and to help integrate our
current software tools.
<p>
Candidates for this position should have a PhD with a strong research
background in computational chemistry.   They should have experience in
applying computational approaches for 2D/3D QSAR analysis and combinatorial
library design.  A working knowledge of UNIX and experience with the
standard modeling packages is a must, and knowledge of programming and
script development would be a plus.   A working knowledge of synthetic
chemistry and very good interaction skills are needed.   Industrial
experience would be preferred.
