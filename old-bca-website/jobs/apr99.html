<h2>ISIS FACILITY</h2>

<h2>RUTHERFORD APPLETON LABORATORY, OXFORDSHIRE</h2>

<h2>SCIENTISTS FOR NEUTRON SCATTERING RESEARCH</h2>
<p>
ISIS is the most powerful source of pulsed neutrons and muons in the world
and is one of the UK's leading centres for experimental condensed matter
research. The facility accommodates approximately 20 neutron and muon
spectrometers which are used by UK and foreign scientists from a broad range
of disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology and materials science. The
experiments are performed under the direction of a dynamic and innovative
team of about 100 experimental scientists.
<p>
We now have two vacancies in the Large Scale Structures Group:
<ol>
  <li>
Post A (Fixed-term appointment, 3 Years); a biologist with an interest in
applying scattering techniques to their research, and
  <li>
Post B (Long-term appointment); an experimental physical scientist with
interests in soft condensed matter physics and chemistry to work in the
neutron reflectometry programme.
</ol>
<p>
These posts are suitable for either graduate or postdoctoral scientists who
have shown an aptitude for original research. The appointees will be
expected to carry out their own research and to take on responsibility for
operating and developing one of the Group's neutron spectrometers.
<p>
<strong>Post A</strong> carries a wider responsibility in promoting the
use of all the
neutron scattering techniques used at ISIS by the biological research
community, and interaction with the National Biological Solid State NMR
Facility based at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) is expected.
<p>
Applicants require a degree in a scientific, mathematical or engineering
subject, together with relevant post graduate research experience or NVQ
Level 5 or equivalent plus substantial experience. The salary range is
between £17730 & £26600 and £22130 & £33200. Appointment is normally at the
minimum however, relevant experience will be taken into account. Progression
within the salary range is dependent upon performance. A non-contributory
pension scheme and a generous leave allowance are also offered.

<h2>EUROPEAN SYNCHROTRON RADIATION FACILITY</h2>
<p>
In Grenoble, France, the ESRF has constructed a state-of-the-art storage
ring for 6 GeV electrons which is operated 24 hrs/day as a high brilliance
synchrotron radiation source for the production of X-rays. The financing of
the ESRF is shared by thirteen European countries. At the end of 1998, 30
ESRF beamlines will be open to users. The ESRF supports scientists in the
implementation of fundamental and applied research on the structure of
condensed matter in fields such as<br>
 <br>
Physics, Chemistry, Crystallography, Earth Science, Biology and Medicine,
Surface and Materials Science. <br>
 <br>
The Experiments Division designs, constructs and runs the ESRF beamlines.
Within this division the Elastic Diffuse Scattering group is now seeking to
recruit a  <br>
 <br>
Post-doctoral fellow (m/f) <br>
for the Microfocus Beamline (ID13) <br>
 <br>
THE FUNCTION: <br>
Beamline ID13 is a beamline with special emphasis on microdiffraction on
organic and biological samples. We are looking for a scientist who will
participate in the operation and future development of this beamline in
single crystal diffractometry. This includes local contact duties like
assisting visiting scientists in the conducting of their experiments. The
successful candidate is expected to develop a strong research project in a
topic linked to exploring the limits of diffraction and/or diffuse
scattering from very small crystals down to sub=B5m=B3 volume.

 <br>
QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE: <br>
Candidates should hold a doctorate in physics, crystallography or other
appropriate science. Experience with synchrotron radiation instrumentation
(or similar), and computer programming, would be an advantage. <br>
  <br>
The working language at the ESRF is English, though some knowledge of
French is desirable. <br>
  <br>
OUR OFFER: <br>
The ESRF offers an exciting opportunity in an international atmosphere,
sharing a site with several other major European scientific institutes. New
staff coming from outside the Grenoble area benefit from installation
allowances, and non-French staff also benefit from an expatriation
allowance in accordance with specific regulations. Only candidates holding
a Ph.D. obtained less than 3 years ago are eligible for Post-doctoral
positions. Post-doctoral fellows are employed for a two year-period with a
possibility of extension to three years and the contract will start as soon
as possible. <br>
 Further information on the post can be obtained from Christian
Riekel (tel.: +33 (0)4 76 88 20 51), email: riekel@esrf.fr).
If you are interested, please send us a fax (+33 (0)4 76 88 24 60) or an
e-mail (recruitm@esrf.fr) with your address, and we will provide you with
an application form. Or print out an application form on the World Wide Web

<h2>PostDoc in Indiana Univ/NIST</h2>
<p>
A postdoctoral position is available in the Indiana Univ/NIST
polarized 3He program, employed by Indiana Univ. and
working at the NIST Center for Neutron Research
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The primary thrust of the program is developing
and applying 3He-based polarizers to materials science and fundamental physics.
We also have a spin-off program in polarized gas MRI.   Both spin-exchange
and metastability-exchange optical pumping of 3He are being pursued.
Collaborators include Indiana University, Los Alamos, Argonne, the Univ. of
Pennsylvania, and the Univ. of Virginia.  Recent results include application
of 3He polarizers to small angle neutron scattering, collaboration in
developing a 3He polarizer for the proposed Los Alamos experiment on
parity violation in the absorption of neutrons by hydrogen, and compression
of polarized 3He for application to both neutron polarizers and MRI.
	Although the primary responsibilities of this position are for
polarized 3He, there will be the opportunity to participate in other activities
of the group, which include weak interaction experiments and neutron
interferometry </p>
(see <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div846/Gp3/gp3.html">
http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div846/Gp3/gp3.html</a>).<br>

Each Fellowship aims to provide advanced research and training
opportunities for a well qualified woman research scientist or engineer,
with a PhD or good Honours degree, seeking to resume her career after a
break due to family commitments.  The Fellowships are tenable in a science
or engineering department or related institution at the University of
Cambridge and the successful applicants will be elected to Research
Fellowships at Lucy Cavendish College for the tenure of their appointment.
<p>
The appointments will be for two years, half-time, and the stipend will be
pro rata on the RA1A scales for teaching staff, which will amount to a
minimum of  8,785 GBP per annum + 650 GBP extraordinary expenses in the
