<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Manchester Materials Science Centre on behalf of EPSRC
and the UK strain measurement community and the ILL Millennium Project are
jointly funding the building of a new neutron diffraction instrument for the
measurement of engineering strain at the ILL, the European neutron research
facility.  As a result post doctoral research associate (PDRA), instrument
scientist (IS) and technician (T) posts are available; the PDRA in
Manchester for 3 years, the others stationed primarily in France for 4
years.</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">The PDRA and IS positions would suit physicists, materials
scientists or engineers, with experience in the areas of diffraction,
instrumentation, or at the computer/user interface would be beneficial. 
Together with an IS paid by the ILL, the IS will be responsible for the day
to day development of the new instrument and the science undertaken on it.
The PDRA will work closely with this project and other strain measurement
projects in Manchester.  The technician will support the development of the
instrument and so engineering and design skills would be an advantage.</P>

<h2>
Instrument Scientist for the Design and Building <br>
of the New Joint UK-ILL Strain Scanner</h2>
<h3>The Manchester Materials Science Centre</h3>
<P>The Manchester Materials Science Centre is a joint centre run between two
universities; the University of Manchester and the University of Manchester
Institute of Science &amp; Technology.  In the latest research assessment it
received the highest rating (5*) indicative of world class research.  It
carries out research into metals ceramics and polymers having over 150
staff.  The Unit for Stress and Damage Characterisation was initiated with
£1.8M of funding from the UK Joint Infrastructure Fund and opened in June
2000.  It is Directed by Prof. Withers and aims to undertake world class
research on metals, polymers and ceramics as well as measurement
methodologies in the stress and damage areas.  It aims to become a national
centre of expertise.</P>

<h3>The Institut Laue Langevin</h3>
<P>The ILL is a European research facility funded predominantly by Germany,
France and the UK, with a number other smaller European partners.  It is a
constant flux neutron source with 24 publicly available instruments and 12
more collaborative instruments available 50% to general users. It has a very
wide spread of nationalities working full-time on site as well as a large
and constant flux of international visitors carrying out experiments.</P>

<h3>The New Strain Scanner and the Millennium Plan</h3>
<P>As part of the Millenium Plan to extend the facilities at the ILL a joint
project has been set up between the UK and the ILL.  It UK component is
co-ordinated from the Manchester Materials Science Centre on behalf of the
UK strain measurement community and is funded by the EPSRC.  Under the
agreement, the UK will contribute 1 instrument scientist and 1 technician to
the project and the ILL 1 instrument scientist and technician time
equivalent to 1 person.  The duration of the project is 4 years, with much
of the heavy works done in year 1.  The working language of the facility is
English.</P>

<P>In addition to the design of the instrument, the team will be responsible
for the user environment.  This will include, simple and effective setting
up procedures (automated where possible), the data acquisition and analysis
suite and interfacing auxiliary equipment to the instrument.  All aspects
must be designed in a user-oriented way, such that ultimately, the user can
control the acquisition and analysis processes themselves.  As a result
considerable time will be available to the design team to carry out
experiments which extend or simplify the operation of the facility.  Every
encouragement will be given to publish work.</P>

<P>Considerable responsibility for the day to day running of the project
will rest with the two instrument scientists.  Likewise, the technician will
have to demonstrate considerable initiative in the organisation and
execution of their work programme. </P>

<h3>The Instrument Scientist Post</h3>
<P>This is a four year post with the post-holder stationed substantially at
the ILL, Grenoble.  They will work alongside the ILL instrument scientist
assigned to the project.  It is expected that the successful applicant will
focus on the experimental application of the technique and development of
the data acquisition suite.  They will report to, and work closely with, the
Manchester team. </P>

<P>While no specific experience is necessary, a PhD (or equivalent) in
physics, instrumentation, engineering, materials science or a related
numerate discipline is required and the applicant should have some of the
following experience/skills;</P>

<UL>
  <LI>have an aptitude for experimental measurement</LI>
  <LI>knowledge of diffraction methods</LI>
  <LI>have some knowledge of instrumentation</LI>
  <LI>be able to define work programmes and ensure that time scales are 
met</LI>
  <LI>have the initiative to work with little supervision</LI>
  <LI>have the capability to communicate with scientific, technical and 
administrative staff and work as part of a team</LI>
  <LI>willingness to travel and liase with the UK community</LI>
  <LI>be able to write progress reports and give oral presentations</LI>
  <LI>be able to communicate effectively in English</LI>
</UL>


<P>Some knowledge of high level symbolic control and acquisition packages
such as Labview, Matlab, etc would be advantageous.  The start date is
negotiable, but an early start date is preferred.</P>

<P>Any detailed questions about either post should be directed to Prof. Phil Withers at <A href="mailto:philip.withers@man.ac.uk">philip.withers@man.ac.uk
