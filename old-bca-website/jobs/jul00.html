<h2>Post Doc Position in Edinburgh</h2>
<center>
Postdoctoral Research Associate in Polymer Physical Chemistry
<br><br>
Department of Chemistry, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh UK
</center>
<p>
Applications are invited for this one-year post funded by the EU. The
successful candidate will be joining a EU-funded research Network involving
7 research teams in Europe. He/she will investigate molecular motion and
blend miscibility in polymers using neutron scattering and will closely
interact with partner laboratories to establish links between NMR, neutron
scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. The goal is to develop a new
understanding of molecular motion in polymers and its relation with
structure and bulk properties such as mechanical and rheological behaviour.
</p>
<p>
This position which is <strong>available from 1st August 2000 </strong>
is open to nationals of any member state of the European Community, except
the United Kingdom. Applicants should have a PhD in Chemistry, Physics or
related subjects. Experience in scattering techniques (X-ray or neutron
scattering) is desirable. Starting salary up to £ 18,185 per annum.
</p>
<p>
The candidate will be joining a very active research group with interests in
polymer blends, liquid crystalline polymers, ion conduction, physical ageing
and polymer dynamics. He/She will be involved in the Network spending
several periods of approximately three weeks in partner laboratories to
discuss and compare the neutron data with results from NMR and molecular
simulations.</p>

 <h2>Post Doc Position in Chicago</h2>
<center>
Protein Structure and Function<br><br>
University of Illinois at Chicago
</center>
<p>
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in
structural biology in the group of Connie Jeffery in the Laboratory for
Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences.  The position
requires a Ph.D. in structural biology, biochemistry or a closely
related field. The ideal candidate will have interests in protein
structure and function, and will have either extensive experience in
protein biochemistry, with a desire to learn macromolecular X-ray
crystallography, or experience in  crystallography with a desire to
learn protein biochemistry. </p>
<p>
Projects in the lab include studies of the structure and function of
the multifunctional enzyme and cytokine phosphoglucose isomerase/
neuroleukin/autocrine motility factor (PGI)
(<italic>Biochemistry</italic> (2000) 39(5):955-964) and members of the
ATP binding cassette family of transporters.  High resolution crystals
have been obtained for the PGI project. </P>
<p>
 The Jeffery laboratory is located in a new state-of-the-art building
that houses our Macromolecular Crystallography Center.  X-ray data
collection equipment incudes a Rigaku generator, a Rigaku R-AxisII
imaging plate detector, a Siemens HiStar multiwire-area detector, and
MSC and Oxford low-temperature systems.  The wet lab is fully equipped
for molecular biology and protein expression, purification, and
biochemical characterization.  The center and our 25 minute proximity
to the Advanced Photon Source make UIC an excellent environment for
x-ray crystallographic studies. UIC, the largest University in the
Chicago area and the largest medical school in the U.S., is located
near downtown Chicago, a city with great cultural and scenic offerings.

Post Doctoral Research Assistant 
to work with Professor Chris Gilmore at Glasgow University
on novel phasing methods in protein crystallography funded
by the BBSRC.</p>
<p>
The position is available for 2 years from any time in the near
future and the candidate will join an active, well-funded research
group in crystallography in the Chemistry Department.</p>
<p>
You should enjoy working with computers and ideally have experience
wih UNIX, FORTRAN and C programming, although some of these skills
can be taught as appropriate. You should also have a crystallography
background although this need not necessarily be in macromolecular
crystallography.</p>
