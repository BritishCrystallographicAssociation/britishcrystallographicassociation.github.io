<h2>Department of Physics and Astronomy: University of Leeds</h2>
<h3>Lectureships/ Senior Lectureship/Readership</h3>
<p>
The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Leeds plans to
make two academic appointments in the areas of Condensed Matter Physics and
of Molecular Physics or Biophysics. Both appointees will have research
records commensurate with a grade 5 RAE research rating. The posts may be
filled at lectureship level (A or B) but for a suitably qualified candidate
one of the appointments may be made at senior lectureship or readership
level.</p><p>
One post will be in the Condensed Matter Group which is to be headed by
Professor R Cywinski when he takes up his Chair on 1 September 2000. The
interests of the group are wide ranging and encompass the magnetic and
superconducting properties of alloys, compounds and nanoscale structures.
There is a wide range of in-house facilities for the preparation of thin
films, including MBE and sputtered thin films and crystalline and amorphous
alloys. The group profits from a wide range of national and international
collaborations and has strong links with major neutron and muon beam
facilities. The research activities of the successful applicant must
complement and extend the existing research profile of the Group.
The other post will be in Molecular Physics or Biophysics in the group
headed by Professor Batchelder. Research in the Group is currently focused
on studies of self-organising films and nanoparticles, solid-supported
bilayers, wetting and wetting transitions, polymer structure, protein
structure and folding, and biomolecular interactions. Techniques used and
developed in the Group include Raman microscopy and SNOM; FTIR, UV-Vis and
fluorescence spectroscopy; ps and ns time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy; single molecule spectroscopy; AFM and STM and ellipsometry. In
the area of theoretical macromolecular physics and biophysics,
collaborations are currently growing with the research group in Polymers and
Complex Fluids.</p><p>
For general enquiries about the post, contact Professor Alan Watson
(headphys@leeds.ac.uk). Specific enquiries about the first post may be made
to Professor R Cywinski (rc7@st-andrews.ac.uk), Professor G J Morgan
(g.j.morgan@leeds.ac.uk) or Dr B J Hickey (b.j.hickey@leeds.ac.uk). For
enquiries about the second post please contact Professor D N Batchelder
(d.n.batchelder@leeds.ac.uk), Dr Steve Evans (s.d.evans@leeds.ac.uk) or Dr
Alastair Smith (d.a.m.smith@leeds.ac.uk).
The closing date for applications is 30 April 2000 and it is hoped that the
appointees will take up their posts on 1 September 2000 or as soon as
possible thereafter.

<h2>INSTRUMENT SCIENTIST FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS </h2>
<h3>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire</h3>
<h3>Fixed Term (3 years)</h3>
<p>
Neutron strain scanning is a rapidly developing technique for 
the non-destructive measurement of stress and strain.  A 
second generation strain scanning instrument, ENGIN-X, is 
presently under construction at ISIS, the world's leading 
pulsed neutron source.  This will bring an order of magnitude 
improvement in performance over the existing ENGIN.  There is 
therefore a requirement for an instrument scientist to join 
the existing engineering team.
</p><p>
The post holder will be expected to take an active part in 
developing the engineering field at ISIS.  In particular, they 
will spend time both as instrument scientist for ENGIN, and 
assisting in developing new methods of data analysis and new 
neutron scattering techniques of interest to engineers and 
metallurgists, for use on ENGIN-X.  In addition to helping 
support the engineering instruments, the post holder would 
also be expected to develop their own research program, and 
assist in commercial research where relevant.
</p><p>
Candidates should have a first degree in Physics, Engineering, 
Metallurgy or Materials Science and a relevant PhD or equivalent 
experience.  Familiarity with the neutron strain scanning 
technique is essential, and a general understanding of other 
neutron scattering techniques of use to metallurgists and 
engineers would also be an advantage.  The ideal candidate will 
also have experience of data analysis methods and be able to 
write data analysis computer programs themselves when required.  
An ability to understand the broad range of problems faced by 
commercial users is necessary, as is an ability to communicate 
well with research managers in industry.
</p><p>
The salary range is between £18,620 and £24,000, depending on 
experience.  A non-contributory pension scheme and a generous

<h2>POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
<h3>Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Biomolecular Structure Center<br>
University of Washington, Seattle, USA</h3>
<p>
In the near future several postdoctoral fellowships are available
in our laboratory to work on a number of medically relevant structural
biology projects. The goals of these studies are to unravel mechanisms of
action of proteins and at the same time use the structural information
obtained for the development of potentially useful therapeutic
compounds. The projects are all embedded in exciting structure-based drug
design collaborative networks.
</p><p>
Most of the projects are aimed to combat major infectious
diseases, while one is also of major importance for cancer. A brief
description of projects is as follows:
</p><p>
<ol>
  <li>
Structural investigations of the biogenesis of unique organelles,
called glycosomes, in Trypanosomatids which are protozoa responsible for
several of the most important infectious diseases world wide. The
glycosomal matrix proteins are all synthesized in the cytoplasm after
which they are transported into the glycosome via a most unusual and
interesting yet far from completely understood import mechanism. This
process somehow involves almost two dozen different proteins called
"peroxins". The goal of the project is to unravel the structures of the
proteins crucial for this import process, to see how they interact with
the "cargo proteins" and with each other during the translocation of
proteins from the cytoplasm into the glycosome. Structure-based inhibitor
design projects, aiming at discovering selective inhibitors of this import
process, will be initiated immediately once crystal structures have been
elucidated.<br><br>

<li>Structure-based drug design projects focusing on glycosomal proteins
from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania species. These are crystallographic
studies in close collaboration with medicinal chemists, molecular modelers
and parasitologists. The aims are (i) to improve the affinity of very
promising inhibitors already developed in the course of the project, and
(ii) to discover and design entirely novel inhibitors of other target
proteins. Excellent expression systems of the target proteins are
available. We are not only focusing in the active site and co-factor
binding sites of enzymes but also on blocking glycosomal import signals of
these glycosomal proteins.<br><br>

<li>Crystallographic investigations on human and malaria topoisomerase
I. Eukaryotic topoisomerases I are remarkable proteins able to relax both
positively and negatively supercoiled DNA by breaking one strand of the
duplex and resealing this broken strand after relaxing the DNA. Several
structures have already been determined in our laboratory of human
topoisomerase in complex with DNA. A major outstanding question is the way
in which several inhibitors of topoisomerase I block the enzyme action. We
not only wish to understand the mode of action of known topoisomerase
inhibitors, but are also collaborating with synthetic chemists to develop
novel inhibitors on the basis of our crystal structures, combined with
molecular modeling and combinatorial chemistry approaches.
<br><br>
<li>Structural studies on components of members of the very large pyruvate
dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex family. These are wonderful,
multi-million Dalton complexes with a highly symmetric core surrounded by
a very dynamic and flexible arrangement of dozens of additional
proteins. We are focusing on components of these complexes from human,
Neisseria as well as other species.
</ol>
<p>
The positions require a great interest in medically oriented
protein crystallography and excellent crystallographic skills. Experience
with protein expression and purification methods is also required for most
projects. For some projects molecular biology know-how is beneficial, for
others experience in protein-DNA interactions and for yet others knowledge
of membrane protein crystallization would be a tremendous advantage.
