have strong background in crystallographic computing and some experience in
protein crystallography. However, candidates with training in experimental
protein crystallography and interested in crystallographic computing are
welcome to apply. Candidates with strong background in computation and
interested in solving crystallographic problems are also welcome to apply.
There are five Structural Biology groups at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, which provide an extremely interactive environment.
State-of-the-art X-ray equipment, computing and graphics facilities are
available in the lab. Ample shared facilities are also available at the new
Weintraub Research Laboratories Building on the picturesque Lake Union
campus.
