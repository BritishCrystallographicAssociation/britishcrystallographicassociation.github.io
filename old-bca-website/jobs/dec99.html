<h2>POSTDOCTORAL POSITION</h2>
<h2>APPLIED PHYSICS INSTITUTE</h2>
<h2>WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY</h2>
<p>
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the utilization of 
pulsed neutrons for elemental characterization. The successful applicant 
will join an active group developing non-destructive methods for bulk 
analysis and characterization.  Preference will be given to candidates with 
a PhD in nuclear physics and a background in neutron physics, nuclear 
electronics, data acquisition systems and Monte Carlo methods.  This is a 
one year position renewable, depending on performance and grant funds 
availability.  Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience. 
 In-house facilities include several sealed tube 14 MeV neutron generators, 
a 1 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole Accelerator, several isotopic neutron 
sources (252Cf, Pu-Be), and a large variety of data acquisition electronic 
units, neutron detectors, and HPGe, NaI(Tl) and BGO gamma-ray detectors.</p>
