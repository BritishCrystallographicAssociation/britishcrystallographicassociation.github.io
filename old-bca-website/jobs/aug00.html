<h2>Postdoctoral Fellowship<br>
McMaster University</h2>
<p>

A postdoctoral fellowship in neutron and x-ray scattering studies
of topical problems in materials physics is offered at McMaster University
under the supervision of Prof. B.D. Gaulin.  Facilities at McMaster include
a modern x-ray scattering laboratory, based on an 18 kW rotating anode 
generator, as well as an extensive array of sample preparation facilities 
including a new floating zone image furnace laboratory for large single 
crystal growth. Areas of current interest include exotic magnetic ground state
materials, high temperature superconductivity, and phases and phase 
transitions in model biological membrane materials.  Experience in neutron 
or x-ray scattering techniques, or single crystal growth is an asset, but 
is not required.  This position is available immediately, but later starting
dates can be accomodated.  Interested parties should arrange to send their cv,
along with the names and contact information of at least two persons familiar 
with their work, to:</p>

<h2> JOB VACANCY AT INSTITUT LAUE-LANGEVIN (Grenoble, France)</h2>
<h3>Reference: Research Scientist 00/31</h3>
<p>
Description:<br><br>

The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is an international research
institute funded by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Agreements on scientific collaboration have also been signed with
Austria, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Russia.
The Institute operates the most powerful source of neutrons in the
world, a 58 MW reactor, which was completely refurbished in 1995. The
reactor forms the basis for a programme of research covering a wide
variety of fields, supplying neutrons to a broad range of instruments
which are available to scientists from the member countries.<br><br>

The ILL has an opening for :<br><br>

A Scientist in the Three Axis Spectrometer (TAS) Group<br><br>

The successful candidate will be a highly motivated scientist having
a PhD in solid state physics or chemistry, an interest in
instrumentation and some previous experience with neutron scattering,
preferably in the fields of magnetism and polarised neutrons.<br><br>

He/she will be expected to carry out his/her own research programme
and participate in the operation and development of the relevant
instrument. He/she will assist the first instrument responsible on
the polarised beam three-axis spectrometer IN20, which is presently
being rebuilt with the aim to achieve a significant increase in
luminosity. His/her specific assignments will concern the spherical
polarimetry (CRYOPAD) and/or spin-echo (TASSE) options on the
instrument. In addition, he/she will be expected to carry out -on a
regular basis- "local contact" duties on the other instruments in the
TAS Group.<br><br>

The successful candidate will be offered a fixed-term contract, the
duration of which will under no circumstances exceed five (5) years.
In addition to a competitive salary, certain benefits (reimbursement
of removal expenses, adaptation allowance, etc.) may be offered.<br><br>

Further information can be obtained by contacting:<br><br>
