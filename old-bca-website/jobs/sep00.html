investigate on irradiation effects. In particular, neutron techniques
and mechanical tests will be considered. The preferred candidates
should have an engineering, physical or chemical background with
emphasis in Materials Science.  Place of work for post-docs is Ancona
(Italy) and the candidates must come from one of the EU countries and
not have worked in Italy in the last two years (Possible stays at
european neutron laboratories are also foreseen); for Doctoral
students the place of work is Juelich (Germany) where the headquarter

POST 1: PEPTIDE/PROTEIN CHEMIST <br>
PEPTIDE DESIGN &amp; NANOTECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>
This is a 24-month BBSRC-funded post to explore nanobiotechnology
applications for a novel protein design.  Skills in peptide or protein
chemistry will be required and experience in biophysical characterisations
of peptides or proteins — e.g. using AFM, CD, EM, FTIR and/or X-ray fibre diffraction — would be an advantage.</P>
<p>
The project will develop a new peptide system in the laboratory 
(Pandya <em>et al. </em>Biochemistry <strong>39</strong> 8728 (2000)).
 Briefly, two peptides have been designed that combine to form extended
nano-scale protein fibres.  The initial focus of the new project will be to
design peptides that self-assemble into more-complex networks such as 3D
grids and matrices.  A second goal will be to functionalise these networks
with small molecules and other peptides and proteins to create novel,
functional biomaterials.</P>

<p><strong>POST 2: MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST<br>
STRUCTURAL/FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS</strong></P>
<p>
This is an 18-month Wellcome-funded post to develop phage-display
methodologies for the rapid identification and preparation of protein
domains from genome-based libraries.  Skills in molecular biology are
essential and experience in phage display and bioinformatics would be an
advantage.</P>
<p>The project builds on methods developed in the laboratory  (Finucane
<em>et al. </em>Biochemistry <strong>38</strong> 11613 (1999)). 
Phage-display libraries will be constructed from randomly generated DNA
fragments to give &quot;protein-domain complements&quot; of the yeasts
<em>S. cerevisiae and S. pombe</em>.  Biopanning methods will be used to select
stable and functional protein domains from these libraries.</P>
<h3>ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>
The School of Biological Sciences at Sussex was rated 5 in the last two
RAEs.  The Woolfson laboratory and the School in general have excellent
facilities and provide stimulating environments for research.  Furthermore,
the Woolfson and related groups are about to relocate to new laboratories
specifically refurbished and equipped for protein design, bioinformatics,
genomics and structural biology.  The new laboratories and associated
equipment will facilitate excellent starts to the new projects.</P>
<h3>SALARY &amp; APPLICATIONS</h3>
The starting salaries will be on the RA1A scale £16,286 - £24,479 depending
on age and experience.  The posts are available immediately, but ideally
would start when the laboratory moves to the refurbished space in November. 
For both posts, possibilities exist for extending contracts beyond the times
given above. <br><br>
Applications including a CV and the names and contact details
for two referees should be submitted to Dek Woolfson, School of Biological
Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer BN1 9QG, UK.</P>
