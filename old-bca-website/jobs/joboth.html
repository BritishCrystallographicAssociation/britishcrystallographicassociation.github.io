   <li>There are now two interesting new links on the career opportunity pages
of the Marie-Curie Fellowships site<a href="
http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/mcfa-career/files/career.html">
http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/mcfa-career/files/career.htm</a>.
In December 98 another job opportunities page was set up at:
<a href="http://www.csb.ki.se/mcfa/openjobs.html">
http://www.csb.ki.se/mcfa/openjobs.html</a>, if that has moved 

try  the main database address below.<br><br>

<B><a href="http://www.mariecurie.org/career/openjobs.html">Marie-Curie Net 
JOBS database</a></B><br>
<p>
The MCFA jobs data base is steadily growing. There are currently 
almost 6000 offers of research posts all over the world hosted on the 
site. With this number the collection is now certainly among the 
largest job collections in Europe specific for research jobs and 
therefore a nice vehicle to make the MCFA and MC fellows known.
</p><p>
In an attempt to further extend the sources for job information I 
have connected a news server to the jobs data base. It is now 
possible to feed the jobs site with announcements posted in a 
specific newsgroup. Currently jobs in "bionet.jobs" and 
"bionet.jobs.offered" are imported, but this could be extended to any 
available newsgroup, as long as the postings are suitable for the 
site and the newsgroup is exclusively used for job offers.
</p><p>
If you know of newsgroups, that could be interesting for this 
purpose, let me please know.
</p><p>
As said earlier, you can always post new announcements by sending a 
plain-text e-mail to the address 
</p><p align=center>
                         jobs@seal.csb.ki.se</p>
<p>
Please ask your institute to make job information available to a 
larger group of interested people and to post announcements to this e-
mail address.

<h3>Site for Career Development for PostDocs</h3>
<p>
Subject:  Career Development Center<br>
  Date:  Tue, 16 Nov 1999 16:58:42 +0000<br>
  From:  Carlos Rascon <carlos.rascon@ic.ac.uk><br>
nization:   Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine<br>
    To:   MCFA-Career <mcfa-career@mailbase.ac.uk><br>
</p><p>

  There is a new resource for science postdocs on the Web.  Next Wave's
  Career Development Center
<a href="http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/feature/careercenter.shtml">
  (http://nextwave.sciencemag.org/feature/careercenter.shtml)</a>
  is a free, comprehensive source of advice and guidance for young
  scientists pursuing academic research career in today's scientific
  community.  In conjunction with our network of experts, we offer
  practical advice on a variety of topics including: writing grant
  applications, review criteria, becoming faculty, designing your lab,
  budgeting and becoming an administrator.
</p><p>
  The site also includes up-to-date information on science policy
  issues, activities of postdoctoral associations around the country,
  changes in the funding landscape and current news events.  Anyone who
  needs information about grants or funding can e-mail questions to the
  GrantDoctor, a weekly advice column (grantdoctor@aaas.org).  In
  addition, researchers can link to GrantsNet (www.grantsnet.org).  This
  free service helps researchers locate funding in the biological and
  medical sciences through a searchable database of over 580 programs.
</p><p>

  Next Wave's Career Development Center is published by Science and the
  AAAS.  Major funding support comes from the Howard Hughes Medical
  Institute (www.hhmi.org) and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund
  (www.bwfund.org).
</p><p>
  Please forward this message to any of your colleagues who may also be
  interested in these issues.

<h2>EPSRC Career development schools</h2>
<p>
EPSRC are funding 4 pilot career development schools this year. This new
initiative is being run by CRAC and UCL in London, Manchester, Strathclyde
and Cardiff. These courses are free to researchers on EPSRC funded projects.
Places will be available to non-EPSRC funded researchers if they remain vacant.
</p><p>
Each school consists of an initial residential phase of 21/2 days.
Participants then carry out a practical career research project and meet
for a final 1 day review 2 months later.
</p><p>
Dates are as follows:<br>
<br>
London: 9-10 March with follow up in May (Now full)<br>
Manchester: 5-7 April and 7 June<br>
Strathclyde: 22-24 August and 11 October<br>
Cardiff 12-14 September and 15 November<br>
