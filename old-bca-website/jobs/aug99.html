<h2>INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR DIFFRACTION DATA</h2><br>
<h2>CRYSTALLOGRAPHY SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS 2000</h2><br>
<br>
<p>
The science of crystallography has played a key role in the development
of Xray diffraction, electron diffraction and neutron diffraction for the
elucidation of the atomic structure of matter. Crystallography is an
interdisciplinary branch of science taught in departments of physics,
chemistry, geology, molecular biology, metallurgy and material
science.&nbsp; To encourage promising graduate students to pursue
crystallographically oriented research, the International Centre for
Diffraction Data (ICDD) has established a Crystallography Scholarship
Fund.&nbsp; While the Ewald Prize is awarded every three years to an
internationally recognized crystallographer, little effort has been made
by science departments to cultivate aspiring crystallographers.&nbsp;
Convinced of the beneficial, scientific impact of the proposed
scholarships for crystallographically oriented research, the ICDD has
solicited funds from private and industrial sectors to support this
program.&nbsp; The ICDD has awarded twenty-eight scholarships in the
amount of $2,000 each since 1992.&nbsp; <strong>
The year 2000 Scholarship Award
has been increased to $2,250.&nbsp;</strong>
 Applications for the year 2000 awards
must be received by ICDD <strong>no later than 29 October 1999.</strong><br>
<br>
<b>Qualifications for the applicant:</b> The applicant should be a
graduate student seeking a degree with major interest in crystallography
e.g. crystal structure analysis, crystal morphology, modulated
structures, correlation of atomic structure with physical properties,
systematic classification of crystal structures, phase identification and
materials characterization. There are no restrictions on country, race,
age or sex.&nbsp; The term of the scholarship is one year. The recipient
may make application for one renewal at the end of the first year.&nbsp;
Because a limited number of scholarships are awarded, renewal
applications will be considered on a competitive basis in conjunction
with all applications that have been submitted up to the closing date.

<dl>
<dd>-Curriculum Vitae, listing degree(s) held and degree(s) sought.

crystallographic research to be partially supported by scholarship.

</dl>Restrictions on the scholarship fund:<br>
</b>
<dl>
<dd>-The scholarship stipend is to be used by the graduate student to
help defray tuition and laboratory fees.&nbsp; A portion of the stipend
may be applied to registration fees to accredited scientific meetings
related to crystallography.
<dd>-No more than one scholarship will be awarded to applicants at any
one accredited institution per year.
<dd>-The funds of the scholarship are not to be used for travel.&nbsp;

<br>

</dl>A committee consisting of the ICDD Chairman, the Chairman of the
ICDD Technical Committee, the Chairman of the ICDD Education
Subcommittee, and three individuals without conflict of interest
administer the awarding of the scholarships.&nbsp; One or more accredited
professors (with no conflicts of interest) may be invited to assist in
the selection of successful candidates.<br>
<br>
<b>Applications must be received by 29 October 1999.&nbsp; Fax
transmittals will be accepted until 29 October 1999, however a hard copy
of the application must be mailed and received by ICDD no later than 1
December 1999.&nbsp; E-mail applications are not acceptable.&nbsp; Please
mail to:<br>
