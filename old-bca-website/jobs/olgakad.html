<h1> OLGA KENNARD RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 1998</h1>
<h3>November 1997</h3>
<p>
Applications are invited for the Olga Kennard Research Fellowship for
research in crystallography or structural molecular biology.  The fellowship
is tenable for five years from 1 October 1998 (or later in the academic year
1998-99).
<p>

<strong>Nationality</strong><br>
Applicants must be citizens of the EU, Norway, Israel or Switzerland, who are either currently employed in the UK or who, if not employed, have at some point been resident in the UK for a continuous period of three years other than for the sole purpose of receiving full-time education. 
<p>
<strong>Qualifications</strong><br>
Applicants should have a Ph.D. or equivalent research experience.
<p>
<strong>Age limits</strong><br>
Applicants should be at least 26 but should not have passed their 40th
birthday on 1 October 1998.  They must have at least three years'
postdoctoral experience by that date.  Part-time work will be counted pro
rata.  In very exceptional circumstances candidates over 40 who have the
right amount of postdoctoral experience may be considered.  Candidates
wishing to apply under this exceptional clause should contact the Research
Appointments Department for advice before submitting an application.
<p>
<strong>Place of tenure</strong><br>
Applicants should propose to hold the appointment in a department in a
British university and should note that they will not be considered if they
already hold a substantive post in such a department or in a European Union
university.  (A substantive post is one which is permanent, i.e. not a
fixed-term contract.)  The successful applicant will be encouraged to spend
up to two years of the fellowship working at institutions elsewhere in
Europe.
<p>
<strong>Salaries and conditions of tenure</strong><br>
The Olga Kennard Research Fellowship is designed to be particularly
beneficial for women as it includes the possibility of additional funds for
family support, conversion for a period to part-time working and maternity
leave if required.  The Fellow will be paid on the academic and
academic-related staff (Lecturer A and B) salary scale which currently runs
from <br>£16,045 to £27,985 plus three additional discretionary points up to 
£31,269.  The tenure of these appointments is for five years only with no
possibility of renewal.  The starting salary will be on the specified scale,
with London Allowance where appropriate, and will rise incrementally each
year.  The holder of this fellowship will be eligible for one of a limited
number of merit increments awarded each year to reward outstanding
performance and will attract annual research expenses (up to about £11,000
for 1998-99) together with travel expenses and a contribution to baggage
costs for successful applicants from overseas and their families.
