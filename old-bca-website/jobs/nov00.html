<h3>
Postdoc studying thin films<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
We are at present seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study
off-specular magnetic scattering of neutrons and x-rays from thin
film magnetic structures. This is a joint project between the
Univeristy of Leeds and ISIS, we expect the postdoc to be mainly
based in Leeds. We are particularly seeking candidates with
experience in one or more of the following areas: thin film
deposition by sputtering and MBE, thin magnetic films, transport
measurements, and in particular structural and magnetic
characterisation of films by neutron and x-ray scattering. Candidates
should have a PhD or equivalent in physics or a related discipline.
The position is available immediately,and is of 3 years duration.
</p><p>
We wish to study micromagnetic disorder by using off-specular
neutron and resonant magnetic x-ray scattering techniques. The
work will involve the growth of ultrathin film magnetic layered
structures with controlled defects or disorder by MBE and
sputtering. Diffuse scattering experiments will be carried out at
ISIS (Rutherford Appleton Lab) and the SRS (Daresbury Lab), with
the potential to also visit ESRF and ILL in Grenoble. This is a
joint project with scientists at ISIS.
</p><p>
Starting salary will be in the range stlg 16,775 - stlg 19,482 per
annum depending on age and experience. If you are interested then
please send a short curriculum vitae including details of all
