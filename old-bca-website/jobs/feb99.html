and<br>
 <br>
<h2>Mechanical Engineer - Neutron Scattering Instrument Design</h2> 
<p>
The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) invites applications for
Instrument scientists and a 
Mechanical Engineer with the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project. The
SNS, a next-generation source for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
Office of Science, is a collaborative project among 5 DOE National
Laboratories led by ORNL. The SNS will consist of a 1-mA H- front-end, a
1-GeV proton linac, and a 221-m circumference accumulator ring. This
accelerator will produce short-pulse neutron beams from a 1-MW beam of
protons bombarding a liquid Hg target, for use by a variety of
state-of-the-art instruments. The facility is scheduled for completion in
2005.
<p>
Full details of the Instrument scientist positions are available from
 Thom Mason, initial assignment may be to Argonne Nat.Lab, ILL for up to 5 
years 
followed by transfer to Oak Ridge for instrument installation and operation.
 
<p>
Major responsibilities of the design engineer include providing 
general mechanical engineering
assistance, design for fabrication, shop follow-up, and performance
evaluations for neutron scattering experimental facilities and
instrumentation for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Experiment Systems
group. Candidate will interact with design/drafting personnel, scientists,
shop personnel, and external suppliers and contractors. The initial
assignment, for up to 5 years during the instrument design phase, is at the
Argonne National Laboratory followed by a transfer to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory for instrument installation and operation. 
<p>
The successful candidate will have a Master's degree or equivalent training
plus a minimum of 2-3 years experience in mechanical engineering with
emphasis on machine design, structures, heat transfer, rotating equipment
and instrumentation. Experience with CAD/CAE programs and some proficiency
with solids modeling using a personal computer, AutoCad Mechanical Desktop
or Parametric Technologies Pro-Engineer, and spreadsheets desired.
Demonstrated knowledge of fabrication techniques needed. Strong written and
oral communication skills and the desire to work in a team environment on
technically challenging problems required.
