<h3>2 POST-DOCTORAL VACANCIES</h3>
<br><p>
Applications are invited for the following positions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A- a post-doctoral research associate who will be in charge of our newly
installed Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Apparatus.
The successful candidate will study the assembly of organic molecules on
metal surfaces in UHV. Applicants should be committed and energetic surface
scientists and have experience with FTIR. They should have a Ph.D in Physics
and a background in Chemistry or vice versa. Experience with other in situ
Surface Analytical techniques is desirable.
The position is initially available from March 2000 for up to 12 months, with a
possibility of further extension depending on the success of the project.
  <li>B- a post-doctoral research associate to carry out Electron Spectroscopy
investigations on fullerene-based materials.
The successful candidate will work on the growth and characterisation of
thin films of these materials in close collaboration with the theory and
experimental groups of the EU-TMR network "The electronic structure and
physical properties of novel fullerene-based materials" (FULPROP).
Collaboration will involve visits to the other laboratories and synchrotron
radiation experiments. Further information about the network is available on
the Web-page: http://www.ifw-dresden.de/iff/11/spec/fulprop/fulp_home.html

 POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY</p>
<p>
A <a href="http://www.biochem.missouri.edu/~lesa/">
postdoctoral fellowship</a>
is available starting immediately in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
The Beamer laboratory focuses on understanding proteins relevant to human disease. Current projects include
structure/function studies of the human bactericidal/permeability increasing protein that is in clinical 
trials for
treating bacterial infections. This work is funded by a 4-year grant from the NSF.  Opportunities for
study of related proteins including the cholesteryl ester transfer protein are also avaiable.  A strong 
background
in protein crystallography or biophysics is desired. Candidates with training in molecular biology and 
protein
purification with an interest in structural biology are also encouraged to apply. X-ray facilities include an
RAXIS IV and 300 mm MAR area detectors, Rigaku RU 200 rotating anode, Osmic focusing optics, and
X-stream cryosystem.  The newly renovated X-ray lab is maintained by a full-time PhD scientist.
The university has recently funded a structural biology facility which will include additional support
personnel in computation and crystallition.

UMC is the flagship university of the Missouri state system. The university
and medical center offer numerous activities, including many sporting events
and an excellent campus concert series. Columbia is located midway between
St. Louis and Kansas City, and was ranked as the second best small town in
the US by Money Magazine in 1999. Nearby outdoor activities include biking,
canoeing, and caving. Housing and other living expenses are VERY reasonable,
making it especially attractive for families. </p>
