<h2>Postdoctoral Position in the Ealick Research Group,<br>
 Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University.</h2>
<p>
A postdoctoral position is available immediately for an investigator to use
single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, including synchrotron radiation
and MAD phasing, to investigate the structures of enzymes. Experience in
protein production and purification, as well as crystal growth of native
enzymes, enzyme/substrate complexes, enzyme/inhibitor complexes, and mutants
is highly desirable. Knowledge of crystallographic techniques including data
processing, phase determination and improvement, model building, and protein
structure refinement is essential.  Current goals of the lab include
structure-based drug design, elucidation of catalytic mechanisms, evolution
of protein function, evolution of biosynthetic pathways and application of
synchrotron radiation to protein crystallography.  Specific projects include
enzymes of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, enzymes of cofactor
biosynthesis, and polyamine biosynthesis. </p>
<p> A recent PhD in chemistry,
biochemistry, biophysics, or a closely related field is required.  Salary
will be commensurate with qualification and experience. The initial
appointment will be for one year, with a possible extension for two
additional years.  Applications will be accepted until the position is
filled.  The candidate should forward a cover letter with curriculum vita,
copies of relevant publications, and contact information for three
references to Prof. Steven E. Ealick (see3@cornell.edu; Baker Laboratory,<br>
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY,

<h1>Want a year in Australia?</h1>
<p>
Victoria University is seeking expressions of interest from women
professors in the fields of engineering and/or science to take up
appointments as Visiting Professors for a period of up to 12 months.
</p><p>
The Program is aimed at bringing into each Faculty in the University an
experienced women Professor from another university in Australia or
overseas, for a period of one year on a secondment or a sabbatical
appointment.  The appointees will be required, in addition to
undertaking research and teaching, to contribute to
Department/School/Faculty and University level operations.  They will be
asked to act as a role model and also to provide to the Director of
Affirmative Action at the conclusion of their appointment a brief,
critical and constructive report on which the University can base
further supportive activity for its female academic staff.
</p><p>
The prospective appointee will be offered a one-year appointment as a
Visiting Professor in the University.  The offer will include
remuneration or recompense to their home institution, relocation costs
and some research funding assistance; the actual offer will be
individualised by the Dean in consultation with the DVC (Higher
Education).
</p><p>
The Faculty of Engineering and Science has approximately  200 effective
full-time staff of which approximately 40 are female located across
three campuses.  It comprises three schools; Built Environment,
Communications and Infomatics and Life Sciences and Technology.  In
addition it has four Centres; Australian Food Marketing Centre, Centre
for Bioprocessing and Food Technology, Centre for Environmental and Risk
Engineering and the Centre for Packaging, Transportation and Storage.
</p><p>
In 1999 the Faculty enrolled 2448 full-time equivalent students
including 2144 in undergraduate programs, 185 in postgraduate coursework
programs and 119 in postgraduate research programs.  As well the Faculty
had 320 full-time equivalent students enrolled in undergraduate and
postgraduate programs in Hong Kong.  In addition the Faculty has 157
full fee paying overseas students enrolled on shore.
</p><p>
I would be interested in gauging your availability and interest in such
a position and would welcome any questions or comments you would like to
make in regard to the Program.  It is hoped that successful appointees
would take up their position in the latter part of 2000 although this is
negotiable.

<h3>POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN PROTEIN
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY</h3>
<p>
wo postdoctoral positions in protein crystallography are available
immediately to study the structure and function of motor proteins,
enzymes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis, antibiotic biosynthesis, and
the structural basis of enzyme evolution.  Good crystals and excellent
expression systems are available for all of these projects.  In addition
outstanding collaborative opportunities exist to participate in other
ongoing projects at the University of Wisconsin.  The work may involve
any aspect of protein purification, mutagenesis, crystal growth, data
collection, model building and refinement.  Excellent new research
facilities will be available for these studies in the Department of
Biochemistry.  Applicants with experience in any aspect macromolecular
crystallography, molecular biology, or protein biochemistry will be
considered.  Salary will be commensurate with experience.  The
University of Wisconsin is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action
Employer.

Environment:
</p><p>
The University of Wisconsin at Madison is situated on 908 acres of land
on the shore of Lake Mendota within one mile of the center of the city
center.  Madison is a pleasant place to live offering a high standard of
living at a moderate cost.  It is built around four lakes with its
capitol building located at the heart of the city on an isthmus between
the two largest lakes.  The city is only 77 miles from Milwaukee, 146
miles from Chicago and 258 miles from Minneapolis.  There are plenty of
things to do outside the lab including sailing, fishing and cycling in
the summer and ice-skating, ice-boating and cross country skiing in the
winter.

<br>
Here are some brief details of what we do.<br>
</p><p>
The Motorola UK Research Lab conducts leading - edge research into the
technologies and applications that will underpin the mobile information
revolution.  As well as developing ground-breaking technologies, we
participate in setting European and global standards, maintain strong
relationships with universities, and collaborate in European funded
programs.  Our talented staff members are drawn from across the world, and
we are always looking for talented people to join our team working in
Multimedia Applications, Speech Technologies and Software and Systems
Engineering.
</p><p>
Multimedia Applications<br>
</p><p>
Concentrating on the opportunities that the mobile internet will bring, our
Wireless Multimedia Applications group are researching the solutions that
will enhance the lives and capabilities of people on the move.  The group is
marrying the disciplines of multimedia technologies, the internet and user
centred research to define the applications that will thrive in tomorrow's
world.  The group has special expertise in wireless video, multimedia
networking and cognitive psychology.
</p><p>
Speech Technologies<br>
</p><p>
Speech will remain an important communication medium and our Speech group is
developing the technologies needed to support future applications. We
recognise the importance of speech in controlling ever shrinking mobile
devices and accessing the wealth of the internet whilst on the move.
Distributed speech recognition, noise robustness, speech driven applications
and speech compression are high on our list of priorities, work which is
strongly tied to our user centred research.
</p><p>
Software and Systems Engineering<br>
</p><p>
Modern telecommunication systems are becoming increasingly rich in features
and functionality, and implementing the software for complex systems with
multiple interactions is no easy matter.  The Software and Systems
Engineering group develop processes and technologies that make the
realisation of the future fast and reliable.  The group melds together
software engineering, computer science and pure mathematics into practical,
integrated solutions that make Motorola world class in software development.
