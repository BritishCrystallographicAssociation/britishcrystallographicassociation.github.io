in Chemistry, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirapalli, India.  I have got
training and research experience relevant to my research career through
various national and internatioanl scientific programmes.  I have also got
an opportunity to attend the "Xth Symposium on Organic Crystal Chemistry,
17-21 August 1997, Poland"  supported by the International Union of
Crystallography.  I have been working on synthesis and X-ray
crystallography studies on some inorganic complexes.  I have synthesized
Zn and Cd metal complexes and crystallized them using various
crystallzation techniques, charaterization of crystals by conventional
methods. The single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have been mainly
carried out for characterization of the compounds. I have analysed the 3-D
structures of compounds and the relevance to their properties.  I have
presented ten papers in a various national and international
conferences/symposia. My thesis deals with crystal structures of some
pharmaceutically importent molecules and their metal complexes.

 <h1>POSTDOC wanted polymers or biopolymers</h1>
<h2>received 29 December 98 by BCA</h2>
Hi Everyone!<br>
 <br>
I wonder if someone out there can help me?  I'm currently looking for a post-
doctoral position in the SAXS world (starting after July 1999).  I am
interested in pursuing SAXS research in almost any area but especially in 
polymers or biopolymers.  I am willing to consider moving to almost 
anywhere in the English speaking world (my French and German are very rusty).
 <br>

My educational background is: <br>
 <br>
<pre>
1999 PhD, University of Iowa, USA (anticipated graduation date July 1999)
     My current work concerns the absorption of HBr and HI into ice films as a
     model system for polar stratospheric clouds.

1996 M.Phil, (research degree), De Montfort University, England
     I worked with Professor Samar Hasnain at the Daresbury Laboratory, England
     and modelled the solution structure of nitrogenase protein and ch
     characterised the lobal closure upon nucleotide binding.

1992 BSc (Hons) 2(2), Chemistry, University of Salford, England
     I worked with Dr Trevor Crowley using SAXS to look at silica samples.

<h2>PostDoc wanted</h2>
<h3>received 17 Apr 99 by BCA</h3>
My name is Yujie Han.  Now I am a Ph. D. candidate of Institute of Semiconductors,
Chinese Academy of Sciences and will be granted Ph. D. degree by June,
1999. I would like to apply for a postdoctoral position or
visiting fellowship in your group, I hope to have the opportunity to pursue
advanced studies in your department. I believe that my academic background
(more than ten years research work on 
semiconductors, growth and defects characterizations, Pd/PdO MOS-type CO
gas sensor, LED, LD, OEIC,), work experience (once sold self-made crystal
growth equipment and related YBCO superconducting thin film growth
technology transfer to university as project leader), and research
interests make me a qualified 
applicant for your program. <br>
 <br>
I have participated in 14 major research
projects (most of them are national key projects) as a member or team
leader (5 of the 14 projects). I have strong ability to bring forth new
ideas, work well with others, and work under pressure.  <br>
I am now working on III-V growth and characterizations as well as DFT
calculations. I am proficient in a wide range of materials physics
techniques and feel confident that I could be helpful to the research
effort in your group from the very beginning. <br>
