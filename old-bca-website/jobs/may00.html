The inclusion of water within organic materials is a matter of considerable
practical importance in the pharmaceutical industry and yet it remains a
poorly understood phenomena. It is intended that this project will develop a
fundamental understanding of the structural reasons for water incorporation
and the relative stabilities of anhydrous and hydrated forms.

<h2>Instrument Scientist at ISIS, RAL</h2>
<p>

An enthusiastic and motivated scientist is required for a position on the
MARI neutron spectrometer at the ISIS Facility.  ISIS is the world's most
intense source of pulsed neutrons and muons, providing research facilities
for condensed matter science.  MARI is a direct geometry chopper
spectrometer with a broad scientific programme covering fields such as low
dimensional magnetism, amorphous materials, chemical spectroscopy and
quantum fluids.
</p><p>
The successful candidate will be part of a team operating the three ISIS
chopper spectrometers MARI, HET and MAPS, but he or she will have particular
responsibility for supporting the experimental programme on MARI.  In
addition to supporting the programme, the successful candidate will be
expected to take an active role in instrument development and to pursue a
scientific research programme making use of MARI and other instruments in
the ISIS suite.
</p><p>
A PhD in the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, materials or earth
sciences) is essential, and experience of postdoctoral research and/or
inelastic neutron scattering is desirable. A flexible approach to working
hours will be required.
</p><p>
The salary range is between £18,620 and £26,600 (Band 5), depending on
qualifications and experience.  A non-contributory pension scheme and a
generous leave allowance are offered.

<h2>Faculty Position</h2>
<h3>The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA</h3>
 <p>

        The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of
Tennessee, Knoxville, is searching for an experimentalist to initiate an
active research program in the general area of materials, using neutron
scattering as a primary tool.  This is a joint UTK/ORNL appointment pursuant
to the Collaborating Scientist agreement between the University and the
Solid State Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This
tenure-track position will be at the assistant professor level, but under
special circumstances the level of associate professor could be considered. 
The home institution of this joint appointment will be The University of
Tennessee. 
</p><p>
 A second Collaborating Scientist in a joint UTK/ORNL position will be hired
in the same area of research, with ORNL being the home institution.  The
assistant professor will be expected to run an active on campus materials
program.   All aspects of materials physics are acceptable but a preference
will be given to soft materials.  The research program must be compatible
with the facilities at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and/or the new
Spallation Neutron Sources- (SNS). 
</p><p>
 Candidates must have a Ph.D. or equivalent and demonstrated experience
in materials science.  Applications are encouraged from minority and female
candidates and should be sent to the chair of the search committee:<br>
 Prof. G.D.Mahan, The University of Tennessee, 401 Nielsen Physics Building, 
Knoxville, TN  37996-1200, USA.<br><br>
   Evaluation of the applicants will begin immediately and
continue to be open until the position is filled.<br><br>

For more information about this position please contact
 Prof. G. D. Mahan (<a href="mailto:gmahan@utk.edu">gmahan@utk.edu</a>).

<h2>NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH</h2>
<h3>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, USA</h3>
<p>

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), in cooperation with
the University of Maryland, is seeking candidates for
an instrument scientist's position at the cold neutron triple-axis
spectrometer, SPINS.</p><p>
A recent Ph.D. in experimental Condensed Matter or Materials
Physics or Materials Science
with experience in study of crystal and/or magnetic
structure and excitations using
X-ray or neutron scattering techniques is sought to share the
responsibilities associated with the operation and upgrade
of the instrument. These responsibilities include assisting visiting
researchers in conducting experiments and analyzing data, instrument
testing and calibration, and participating in a major upgrade
of the instrument.</p><p>

These duties are intended to occupy no more than two-thirds of the instrument
scientist's time to enable him/her to conduct independent or
collaborative research using the SPINS instrument and other facilities
at the NCNR.  Appointment will initially be for two years with the
possibility of extension for up to an additional two years.  Salary is
in the range from $43,000 to $48,000 depending on qualifications and
experience.
