<h2>Joint Appointment HMI/Technische Universität Berlin <br>
</h2></center>
<p>
The Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin (HMI), Member of the Hermann-
von-Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren and the
Technische Universität Berlin
invite applications for a joint appointment as:<br>
<center>
Head of the Department ”Magnetism”<br>
at the HMI <br>
and<br>
Full Professor (C4)<br>
at the Department of Physics <br>
of the Technische Universität Berlin.<br>
specialized in<br>
Studies of Magnetism by Neutrons and Synchrotron Radiation.<br>

</center>
</p>
<p>
Candidates with an outstanding international reputation for research in
magnetism by scattering methods (neutron and/or synchrotron radiation)
are invited to apply. For this field the HMI operates a large variety of
modern neutron scattering instruments at the research reactor BER II and
a set of new instruments are being built by HMI at the synchrotron
radiation facility BESSY. The neutron scattering instrumentation at the
BER II strongly emphasizes the use of polarised neutrons. HMI holds a
top position in providing extreme sample environments (high magnetic
fields and ultra-low temperatures). The successful candidate is expected to
initiate further advances of the experimental facilities at HMI and BESSY
and to perform forefront research in modern areas of magnetism, e.g. thin
films, molecular magnets or quantum phenomena. Supporting external
users in running their experiments is another important duty of the
department of which he/she is going to be in charge.
</p>
<p>
We expect the successful applicant to be committed to the general
program of teaching and training of students at the Technische Universität,
to inspire the scientific work in the department and to foster collaborations
both locally and externally.
</p>
<p>
Both HMI and Technische Universität are seeking to increase the quota of
women scientists. Therefore, women are especially encouraged to apply.
Handicapped applicants will be given preference over others of equal
qualification.
</p>
<p>
Applications must be received 
<strong>no later than January 15th, 2001,</strong> and should
be addressed to:<br>
 Prof. Michael Steiner, Scientific Director, HMI,
Glienicker Straße 100, D-14109 Berlin,<br>
