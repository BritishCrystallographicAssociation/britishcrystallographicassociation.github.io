<h2>Postdoctoral Opportunities</h2>
<h2>Neutron Scattering Research at ORNL</h2>
<p>
Over the next few years there will be several openings for postdoctoral fellows 
in neutron scattering research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  
Candidates must have a PhD in a relevant scientific area.  Prior neutron 
scattering experience is an asset. 
<p>
Current openings: <br>
  Complex Fluids and Colloidal Materials  <br>
  Neutron Scattering Data Analysis and Visualization  <br>
  Crystallography  <br>
  <br>
General information on Neutron Scattering at ORNL is available on our 
website: http://neutrons.ornl.gov <br>

  <br>
The current neutron source at ORNL is the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), a 
light water moderated reactor, operated at 85 MW with a neutron flux of 3E15 
neutrons/cm2/s. Research facilities include instruments for small angle 
scattering, powder diffraction, reflectivity, single crystal diffraction, and a 
complement of triple axis spectrometers for measuring excitations. A full range 
of sample chambers is available including low temperature, high temperature, 
high pressure and magnetic field. The spectrometers at HFIR are utilized by 
many outside users from around the world. There is also an active in-house 
scientific program. The topics addressed include polymers, complex fluids, 
magnetism and superconductivity, as well as other aspects of materials science, 
physics and chemistry. 
<p>
Upgrades anticipated for the HFIR in the near future include the addition of a 
cold neutron source and system of thermal guides. Scientists at ORNL are also 
actively engaged in other aspects of neutron scattering research, including the 
Spallation Neutron Source.
