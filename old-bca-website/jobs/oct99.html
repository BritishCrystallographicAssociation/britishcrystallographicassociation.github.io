<h3>Part time OU tutors</h3>
<p>
The Open University is looking for new part-time staff to tutor a new
course in the Technology Faculty, called T171: You, your computer and the
Net. The pilot presentation has just finished, and the course is expanding
dramatically with over 10,000 students registered for next year.
</p><p>
To quote from the OU's publicity material at 
<a href="http://t171.open.ac.uk/pres/"> http://t171.open.ac.uk/pres/</a>: 
</p><p>
"T171 is a new kind of course which is designed to bring to the World Wide
Web the supported open learning for which the Open University is famous. 
The course is taught entirely on-line - there is no face-to-face tuition.
Each student has a personal tutor available via e-mail, and is a member of
both a tutorial group and a team working on collaborative assignments.
Studying the course involves communications with your tutor and fellow
students via e-mail and conferencing. At the core of the course is a
dynamic World Wide Web site to which only registered students have access.
All of the specially prepared teaching, extension and assessment material
is published on this site, which grows and develops as the course
progresses."
</p><p>
If you are interested in and enthusiastic about using of the Internet, and
familiar with email and electronic conferencing, please have a look at
<a href="http://www.armlink.ndirect.co.uk/ou/t171tut.htm">
http://www.armlink.ndirect.co.uk/ou/t171tut.htm</a>
 or <a href="http://oufcnt2.open.ac.uk/~john_woodthorpe/t171tut.htm">
http://oufcnt2.open.ac.uk/~john_woodthorpe/t171tut.htm</a>, which describes
the vacancies that exist to tutor on this new course as it grows over the
next few months. Paradoxically for an Internet-based course, tutors do
currently need to be based in the UK. That's because there is an
introductory face to face meeting, and the possibility of others if the
students need extra help. There may be a limited number of tutor vacancies
in continental Europe.
</p><p>
The advert is on my personal Web space as I enjoyed the tutoring so much
that I've now found myself as an Assistant Staff Tutor in the West
Midlands Region, with the task of helping recruit and support new tutors
as the course expands.
</p><p>
I'm happy to talk informally about my experiences in tutoring the course
if people want to email me as jw2@tutor.open.ac.uk<br>

VIOLETTE & SAMUEL GLASSTONE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN SCIENCE</h2>
<p>
Applications are invited for the above research fellowships, tenable at the 
University of Oxford, in the fields of Plant Sciences, Chemistry (Inorganic, 
Organic or Physical), Engineering, Mathematics, Metallurgy, and Physics. The 
fellowships will be tenable for one year with a possibility of renewal for up 
to two further years. The awards will be available from 1 October 2000 or as 
soon as possible thereafter.</p>
<p>
There is one fellowship for men and one fellowship for women. These are 
supported from the Glasstone Fund for Men and the Glasstone Fund for Women 
respectively. The salary will be on the RSIA scale (£16,286 - £24,479). The 
number of awards to be made will depend on the value of the funds in 2000
(in  1999 two fellowships were awarded, one from the fund for men and one
from the  fund for women). Additional travel and research support grants may
be available.</p>
