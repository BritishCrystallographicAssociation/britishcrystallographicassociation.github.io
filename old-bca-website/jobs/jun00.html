<h2>Post Doc Position at Grenoble</h2>
<p>
In the frame of the european project SCANS (Software for Computer Aided
Neutron Scattering) a post-doc position is open at the OGG-INFM in
Grenoble.
Its function will be the
development of Monte Carlo kernels describing  the transport properties
of
neutron/x-ray optical elements, in particular for polarized neutrons,
time
of flight instrumentation and the scattering from generic samples. The
codes will then be tested by performing "ad hoc" experiments either at
the
ILL or ESRF. The work will be carried out in the frame of the existing
collaboration among INFM, ILL and ESRF.</p>
<p>
The successful candidate should hold a doctorate in Physics, Chemical
Physics, Chemistry or similar fields or have at least three years of research
experience and should have a good general knowledge in Physics
and possibly in x-ray or neutron scattering. He/she should also have
good
computer and experimental skills.</p>

</p><p>
The position is tenable for 3 years.
</p><p>
Research on the dynamical structure of soft matter and biological 
macromolecules</p><p>


This position is open to post-doctoral candidates who are looking for an
entry position in  research. The research activities of the successful
candidate will be centered around studies of  the static and dynamical
structure of soft matter (e.g. hydrated anorganic and organic  multilayers,
such as layered ionic conductors, clays, phospholipid-surfactant system;
micelles,  polymers, solutions, etc.)  and of biological macromolecules
(e.g. membranes, proteins,  enzymes, ion pumps, etc.). Research methods
comprise neutron  scattering techniques,  especially wide-angle and
small-angle time-of-flight spectroscopy and include extensive  computer
model calculations. Various complementary sample characterization techniques
(e.g.  DSC and broadband dielectric spectroscopy) are available. The
successful candidate will also  participate in experiments of user groups,
who carry out research with the time-of-flight  spectrometer NEAT in many
different areas of condensed matter research.</flushboth>

<h2>PhD Studentship at Salford</h2>
<p>
I would like to hear from someone wishing to do a PhD in neutron
scattering from protons or deuterons in metals. The student would
participate in the <em>ab initio</em> calculations of the excited 
wave functions
and the measurement of the corresponding inelastic cross sections.
Standard <em>ab initio</em> calculations have to be modified to 
allow for the
effect of the proton
zero point energy. Comparisons with experiment for PdH are excellent
(See PLR 84 (2000) 1531). However, it now seems likely that the
traditional explanations have to be modified to take account of
Franck-Condon levels, where the final state is the trapped excited
state. The experimental side will involve use of facilities at the ILL,
Grenoble 
and ISIS (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) and the student could be based
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory or in Manchester.</p>
<p> 
Anyone interested, please contact me by email (<a href=mailto:"
d.k.ross@salford.ac.uk">d.k.ross@salford.ac.uk</a>).<br>
<br>
The support would be at the normal level for a post graduate
 student in the UK,
with funding method depending a bit on nationality.<br>

<h2>Postdoctoral Research Associate Position Available<br>
The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California</h2>
<p>
A full-time postdoctoral research associate position in protein

crystallography is presently available.  The research entails
crystallographic analysis of the structure and mechanism of
mitochondrial transhydrogenase, an integral membrane protein and model
system for the study of proton translocation.  Diffraction quality
crystals of the soluble NAD(H) binding domain are in hand, and a
high-resolution structure of the soluble NADP(H) binding domain has been
solved.  The research includes structure determination of the 80 kD
NAD(H) binding domain, and of the reduced NADH and NADPH bound forms of
both soluble domains.  Further, the opportunity exists to crystallize
the holoenzyme comprised of the interacting soluble domains and the
integral membrane proton channel domain.  The project is in
collaboration with Youssef Hatefi in the Dept. of Molecular and
Experimental Medicine at Scripps where mutagenesis and biochemical
experiments are being done in parallel with the structural analysis.
Scripps provides an exciting environment for structural biology with a
large number of investigators active in crystallography of biological
macromolecules.  Outstanding resources and facilities are available,
including access to the new Scripps-Stanford beam line (BL 11-1) at
SSRL.</p>

Two postdoctoral positions are available immediately to solve
protein structures using modern NMR methods.  Research focus is to
elucidate the molecular basis for cell cycle regulation.  One project
involves studies on a novel protein that regulates oocyte
maturation; another involves investigating a kinase that plays a key
role in cell proliferation.  Fellows will study the solution structures
and dynamics of proteins or protein fragments using hetero- and
homonuclear multidimensional gradient NMR techniques on a 600 MHz Avance
NMR spectrometer.  The projects will also incorporate proteomics
approaches to identify and characterize interacting proteins.

<h2>Postdoc at Indiana University, USA</h2>
<p>
An Indiana University postdoctoral position is available in the
Indiana/NIST program for the development and application of polarized
3He-based neutron spin filters to materials science and fundamental
physics. In the development area, we are pursuing  both metastability-exchange
optical pumping (Indiana and NIST) and spin-exchange (NIST) to produce
the polarized 3He gas.  Current applications in materials science include
small angle neutron scattering at NIST and polarized neutron reflectomtery
at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source at Argonne National Lab. 3He-based
spin filters can also be used in experiments involving the weak interaction
of neutrons, and experiments in various stages of preparation intend to
use this technology.</p>
<p>
The candidate will be based at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility in
Bloomington, Indiana, with trips to the NIST Center for Neutron Research in
Gaithersburg, Maryland and/or the Argonne Intense Pulsed Neutron Source near Chicago.</p>
<p>
This work is quite interdiscliplinary, so applicants from the fields of AMO
physics, nuclear physics, or neutron scattering will be considered.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in physics. The position is available
immediately, but any starting date before Dec. 2000 can be accomodated.</p>
