<h1><a name="riso">PostDocs</a> in Riso</h1>
<p>
The Condensed Matter Physics and Chemistry Department at
Riso National Laboratory, Denmark, is seeking candidates for
two post-doctoral positions within areas of:
Superconductivity, Low-dimensional magnetism, and Magnetism
of nano-sized particles. The candidates will be required to
perform research using the neutron scattering facilities at
Riso, and possibly also synchrotron radiation sources.
<p>
Scientific environment:<br>
The Department has a staff of 20 permanent and 25 temporary
scientists, of which in total 14 work in the fields of
magnetism and superconductivity. The neutron scattering
facilities are based around the DR3 reactor, which has a
cold-neutron source and 8 spectrometers, including the
recently commisioned triple-axis spectrometer RITA. The
facility is open to outside users under the European TMR
program, supporting approximately 55 experiments per year.
<p>
Qualifications:<br>
Applicants should have a recent Ph.D in experimental
solid-state physics or equivalent. They must be able to work
both in a team and individually. Experience in neutron or
X-ray scattering is desirable, although not essential.
<p>
Responsibility:<br>
The successfull applicants are expected mainly to carry out
their own research, but also to participate in instrument
development and to assist outside users in carrying out
neutron experiments. The research in superconductivity may
include both basic and materials science.
<p>
Terms of employment:<br>
The initial appointment will be for one
year with the possibility for extension by a second year.
All other terms of employment will be in accordance with the
terms valid for the Danish scientific staff at Ris=F8 National
Laboratory. The positions are available from January 1,
1998. Ris=F8 National Laboratory is an equal opportunity
employer.
