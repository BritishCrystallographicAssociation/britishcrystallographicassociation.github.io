<h2>Physical Crystallography Group News - EGM and Call for Nominations</h2>
<HR>

<P>
An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Physical Crystallography Group of
the Institute of Physics (IOP) was held on Wednesday 27th January 1999 at
the IOP. There was only one Agenda item, the proposed change of name of the
PCG of the IOP to the Structural Condensed Matter Physics Group. The meeting
was chaired by the Vice-Chairman of the group, Professor J. Finney. The
arguments for the change of name were outlined and correspondence, both for
and against the name change, which had been received by the Secretary, was
read out. The proposal was put to the vote. 10 members voted for the
proposal with three abstensions (Vice-Chairman of PCG, Secretary of PCG and
the BCA President). Accordingly, the name of the group will henceforth be
the <strong>Structural Condensed Matter Physics Group</strong> in its
dealings with the IOP. We shall remain the Physical Crystallography Group of
the BCA.

<h2>1999 PHILIPS PRIZE</h2>
The announcement of the 1999 Philips prize award to <B>Mark Harris</B>,
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, was made during the Closing Ceremony at the
IUCr XVIII in Glasgow. It was given for his work in the field of magnetic
frustration and, in particular, for his work in the area of magnetic
pyrochlores. Magnetic frustration has been known to occur in these materials
for over 40 years. Mark Harris and his co-worker Steve Bramwell were the
first to explain correctly the way in which frustration occurs. In addition,
Mark Harris has linked the ideas of magnetic frustration in a pyrochlore
ferromagnet to the ordering of protons in ice coining the term "spin ice"
recently discussed in Nature 399 311-2  (1999)
