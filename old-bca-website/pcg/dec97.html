<H2 >Physical Crystallography Group Meeting Report<br>
CMMP- 97, Exeter, December 1997</h2>

<P>
The 1997 winter meeting of the Physical Crystallography Group - with the
theme of 'Structural Physics' - took place as part of the IOP Condensed
Matter and Material Physics (CMMP) Conference in Exeter from 17-19 December.
The primary aim of the meeting was to emphasise those aspects of physics in
which a knowledge of detailed atomic structure is vital. To that end, a wide
range of different topics were covered by both the invited and contributed
speakers. Both sessions were very well attended by an audience who would
normally not attend regular BCA meetings.

<P>
In the first of the two sessions, <strong>Dr Des McMorrow</strong>
<em>(Riso)</em> talked about his work on low dimensional magnetic systems
using the new triple-axis spectrometer RITA at the Riso National Laboratory.
In particular, he described recent measurements of the correlation length
and static susceptibility in the 2D S=1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
copper(II) deuteroformate tetradeuterate with the aim of locating a
transition to a quantum critical region. In the second invited talk,
<strong>Dr Graeme Ackland</strong> <em>(Edinburgh)</em> described results
from his computational work on soft-mode phase transitions using a variety
of examples ranging minerals to semiconductors. Many pressure-induced
transitions are between structures related by symmetry-breaking distortions,
typically associated with a phonon mode, an elastic constant, or both. After
describing the phase transition mechanisms, Dr Ackland illustrated the two
transition types with calculations on MgSiO<SUB>3</SUB>, SiO<SUB>2</SUB>,
MgO and CaO . <BR>The first session was rounded off by two contributed
talks. The first, given by <strong>Dr Nguyen-Manh</strong>
<em>(Oxford)</em>, described calculations on the phase transitions and
twinning deformation in binary MAI alloys (M=Ti, V, Zr and Nb). The results
have been applied to the advanced Ti-Al-Nb ternary alloys with the aim of
improving the ductility and strength of these systems. The final talk of the
session was to have been given by <strong>Dr John Loveday</strong>
<em>(Edinburgh)</em> on high-pressure structural studies of ices such as
H<SUB>2</SUB>O, H<SUB>2</SUB>S, NH<SUB>3</SUB> and CH<SUB>4</SUB>.
Unfortunately, Dr Loveday was unable to attend the conference, to the
disappointment people who attended the session particularly to hear this
talk.

<P>
The second session was opened by <strong>Professor Mike Glazer
</strong><em>(Oxford)</em> who described his work on the relationships
between the atomic structure of a material and its optical properties.
Professor Glazer showed how it is now possible to compute the full optical
rotation tensor for an anisotropic material knowing little more than the
crystal structure, and described how optical properties of materials - such
as their linear and circular birefringence - are linked fundamentally to
their structure. The second invited talk of the session was given by
<strong>Dr Steve Hull </strong><em>(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory)</em> on
his structural studies of superionic materials. After an overview of the
different superionic behaviours that are observed, Dr Hull described his
recent experimental results obtained at ISIS, where in situ high-temperature
high-pressure techniques have been used to modify the ionic diffusion
mechanisms. The second session finished with three contributed talks. In the
first <strong>Dr Pam Thomas </strong><em>(Warwick)</em> described studies of
periodically domain-inverted LiNbO<SUB>3</SUB>, using both conventional
x-ray diffraction imaging and coherent beam phase imaging (at the ESRF),
which have revealed both the characteristics of the domain walls and the
effects of the domain-inversion process. The second talk, by <strong>Dr
Alison Aird</strong> <em>(Cambridge)</em>, described a new method of doping
WO<SUB>3</SUB> with Na. Analysis of the resulting microstructure revealed
difference in the Na concentration between the bulk material and the domain
walls, leading, perhaps, to a method of increasing the
Na<SUB>x</SUB>WO<SUB>3</SUB> superconducting transition temperature. The
final contributed talk was given by <strong>Dr Chris Cousins</strong>
<em>(Exeter)</em> who showed that the inability of the two-parameter Keating
model to predict simultaneously, the second-order elastic constants, the
Raman frequency and internal strain parameter of diamond can be rectified by
adding two 3-body terms. Dr Cousins showed that the same procedure can also
be applied to graphite.<BR>

<P>
The best student poster from the Structural Physics session was by
<strong>T.J. Latham</strong> <em>(Warwick) </em>entitled 'A Comparative
Study of KTiOAsO<SUB>4</SUB> and RbTiOAsO<SUB>4</SUB> and
KRbTiOAsO<SUB>4</SUB> for Nonlinear Optics'.<BR>

<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the speakers and poster
presenters for their excellent contributions to the sessions. I would
particularly like to thank those speakers who tried, and succeeded, in
adapting their talks for a non-specialist audience.
