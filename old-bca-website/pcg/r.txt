Jeremy and I have discussed a possible financial model for the Rietveld=20
workshop.

Costs:
Cost of facilities at Birkbeck (heavily subsidised by dept): =A3500
Expenses for 3 lecturing/teaching staff: =A3500
Cost of 40 rooms to accommodate students: =A32400
Contingency: =A3600
Total cost: =A34000

Income:
The ccp14 grant contains a training element and can contribute =A32000.
We have discussed informally with the Centre for Molecular Structure and=20
Dynamics (CMSD) the possibility of sponsorship of =A31000.
We seek approval for PCG funds of =A31000.
The RSC Solid State Group could be approached to support student=20
bursaries if necessary.

We propose the meeting will be free to BCA student members, =A310 to=20
non-members (who will receive a year's membership) and =A330 to post docs=
=20
or permanent university staff.  It seems reasonable that students can=20
raise travel expenses from their departments/supervisors.  Meals will be=20
in local University canteens (~=A35 per meal).  Our initial financially=20
conservative model has students paying for their own lunches.

If people have objections/suggestions could they let us know?
