<strong>Co-opted Members of Physical Crystallography Group Committee
 1998-1999</strong>
<P>
I am pleased to report that Dr. Sue Kilcoyne of University of St. Andrews,
Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, has agreed to join the PCG Committee
with effect from October 1998 as a co-opted member. A second nominee for
co-opted membership has been approached and we are awaiting his reply.

<h2>Philips Prize for Physical Crystallography 1999</h2>
<P>
This is the time of year when we usually make a call for nominations for the
Philips prize for Physical Crystallography. However, with the absence of a
BCA Spring Meeting in 1999, the Philips prize will be awarded at the
International Union of Crystallography Congress in Glasgow in August. This
will be a good opportunity to showcase talent in Physical Crystallography
(or Structural Physics - see below!) to the whole crystallographic community
worldwide. Therefore, we urge you to start thinking now about possible
nominees in the usual category of a youngish up-and-coming scientist with
publications of note, whose career stands to benefit from the award of such
a prize. Note that the nominations need not be restricted to UK-based
scientists and perhaps, in the year of IUCr, we could reasonably appoint an
overseas winner (since such a person might well be attending IUCr anyway).
The usual formal call for nominations and the pro-forma will appear in
December's issue of Crystallography News.


<h2>Name Change from Physical Crystallography Group of the IOP 
to Structural Physics Group</h2>
<P>
The process of changing our identity from PCG to Structural Physics is
underway. The next step is that the proposal be taken to the Condensed
Matter and Materials Physics (CMMP) divisional meeting, which will take
place some time in September. Our representative at the divisional meeting
is Dr. Malcolm McMahon of Liverpool University. No problems with the
name-change are envisaged, but one of the other groups may come up with some
objection at the meeting, so we will have to wait and see what
transpires....

<h2>Autumn Meeting: <BR>Structural Physics of Functional Materials, 
University of Warwick, 25/11/98</h2>
<P>
The overall aim of the meeting is to demonstrate how crystallography,
structural physics and structural science in general underpin the study of a
range of technologically-important "functional" materials. The choice of the
meeting topic and the title have been informed by current developments
within both EPSRC and the Institute of Physics. Within EPSRC, there is an
initiative to promote Crystallography or Structural Science as a discipline
in its own right and, to reinforce this, our speakers have been drawn from
Departments of Physics, Chemistry and Materials. Within the Institute of
Physics, we are going through the process of changing our identity from the
Physical Crystallography Group to the Structural Physics group in a bid to
reflect more accurately the activities of a wide number of our members. The
topic "Structural Physics of Condensed Matter" now appears as an EPSRC/IOP
heading.  
<BR>
<BR><em>Please note that we have invited both EPSRC and IOP
representatives to this meeting and we urge you to give it your strongest
support.</em>

<strong><BR>1998 Autumn Meeting of the Physical Crystallography Group 
of the BCA<BR>/Structural Physics (provisionally) Group of the I.O.P.<BR></strong>
<HR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
The Autumn Meeting of the PCG, entitled <BR><BR>'<strong><em>The Structural
Physics of Functional Materials'</em></strong><BR><BR>will take place at the
University of Warwick (Radcliffe House) <BR><BR>on Wednesday 25th November,
1998.</p>

<P>
The anticipated cost will be &pound;25 for full members and &pound;18 for
student/retired members. This will include a carvery-style restaurant lunch,
morning tea and afternoon coffee. The meeting will commence at around 10.30
a.m. and end at around 4.30 p.m. Further details of the meeting, including
the registration procedure, will be posted on the BCA World-Wide Web pages
as soon as they are available (around July 1st). They will also appear in
the next issue of Crystallography News and will be sent via the Institute of
Physics direct- mailing to IOP group members.
