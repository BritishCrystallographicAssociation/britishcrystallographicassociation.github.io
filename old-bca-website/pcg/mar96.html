<h1><a name="Phil96">Philips </a>Physical Crystallography Award 1996</h1>


The winner of the Philips Award for 1996 was <strong>Dr. C. C.
Wilson</strong>
 of ISIS. Dr. Wilson, otherwise known as Chick to his many friends and
colleagues, is a well-known figure in neutron diffraction in the UK and
abroad. He received his prize primarily for his sterling work on the
single-crystal diffraction station (SXD) at ISIS and particularly for his
novel time-efficient data collection methods. Chick has effectively employed
an area detector for time-of-flight (tof) Laue diffraction. Although the
solution of static structures is less favourable on such an instrument, the
system is ideal for monitoring changes in structure and he has recently
developed this capability for the study of structural phase transitions and
hydrogen-atom disorder in low-symmetry molecular crystals.<p>

 Materials that he has studied include PbHAsO4 and benzoic acid.  In the
latter case, a full set of data for refinement was collected at 175 K in
only one day with subsequent runs at 100 K, 50 K and 20 K taking a further
three days. These are rapid experiments by single-crystal neutron standards.
From the data, Chick has been able to follow the hydrogen atom ordering in
benzoic acid. Linear behaviour of lnK vs 1/T (K being the ratio of the
occurrence of the two possible configurations) was found down to 50 K,
allowing the energy difference between the two configurations to be
determined.  However, the 20 K point lies off the line, indicating that
there is more interesting physics in the system. Data between 50K and 20K
and below 10 K are required to complete the study and should be obtained
soon. <p>

Dr Wilson has made a further innovative contribution to the tof Laue method
by the employment of the multi-crystal data collection technique which
involves the exposure of several crystals of the substance under
investigation at once. The crystals, which are oriented randomly with
respect to each other, are mounted in a glass capillary and are separated
from each other by glass wool. One-crystal, two-crystal and three-crystal
exposures are taken and processed together to provide a fuller data set than
that obtained from a single crystal alone. The time for collecting a full
data set can be reduced substantially by using this multi-crystal technique.
In addition, the technique also allows more flexibility in the use of sample
environment, since fewer crystal rotations are required. <p>

Chick gave a clear and interesting presentation of his research work to the
assembled audience at the Tuesday morning session of the British
Crystallographic Association Spring Meeting in Cambridge. Chick has been a
familiar figure at BCA meetings over the past years and has picked up poster
prizes, I recall, on more than one occasion. Even though he frequently
confesses to being a chemical crystallographer when pressed, I think that
all in the audience would agree that he is a worthy winner of the Physical
Crystallography award for 1996.<p>
