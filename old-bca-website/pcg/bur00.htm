The PCG welcomes bursary applications from BCA or IoP members who are
affiliated to the PCG or to the Structural  Condensed Matter Physics Group
of the IoP. These are intended mainly to help young  scientists (students
and post-docs) to attend meetings and conferences relevant to  PCG/SCMP
areas of interest. Bursaries can be applied for at any time, through the
PCG/SCMP  Secretary (see below) and will be considered by the Group
Committee. However,  each year we expect to target selected meetings as
highly relevant for the award of bursaries.
<P>
For the remainder of 2000 the targeted
meetings are ECM-19 and CMMP-2000, a session of which will comprise the PCG
Autumn meeting
(see above). Applications are expected to be received by the PCG Secretary
<strong>at least two weeks</strong> prior to any early registration deadline
 - more details of deadlines will be
publicised on this Website.</p>

and return it to him with the abstract of the
presentation you intend to make at the conference.
