The workshop will take place immediately prior to the Nottingham BCA meeting,
on Sunday 24 and Monday 25 March, 2002, in Room A63a in the
Economics & Geography Building.
<P>
This meeting is intended to begin a series of tutorial workshops
organised by the PCG on powder diffraction profile refinement methods.
This technique, much used and a vital component of much of
physical crystallography, is very powerful but if improperly used
can lead to problems both in the refinement process itself and
in the resulting structural models.
The aim of these workshops is to provide a general introduction
to the method and its applications. They are aimed both at those
new to the technique, particularly research students and post-docs,
and those who feel the need for a refresher.
<P>
The first of these workshops will introduce the basics of profile
refinement using the Rietveld method.
The workshop will include introductory lectures, demonstrations
and hands-on examples. Topics will include:
<UL>
<LI>principles of Rietveld refinement, including minimisation;
<LI>crystal structure refinement and what it achieves, including the use of constraints and restraints;
<LI>data collection strategies, including angle- and energy-dispersive techniques with both X-ray and neutrons;
<LI>basic refinement strategies - how to give yourself the best chance to get the right result;
<LI>an introduction to some of the software suites available.
</UL>
<P>
Registration forms are now available in
<A HREF="rietreg.doc">MS Word</A> or <A HREF="rietreg.pdf">Adobe PDF</A> format.
The cost is just <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>&pound;25</FONT> including accomodation
and meals on Sunday 24<SUP>th</SUP> March.
<P>
Speakers will include <B>Bill David</B> (ISIS/UCL),
<B>Jeremy Cockcroft</B> (Birkbeck) and <B>Kevin Knight</B> (ISIS).
