Since the purchase of Philips Analytical by Spectris PLC in September
2002 the company is trading under the name of PANalytical Limited.
PANalytical have agreed to continue to sponsor the annual award for
Physical Crystallography which will be renamed the "PANalytical Physical
Crystallography Award".  The award is presented for the best recently
published work (say 2-3 papers in the last few years) by a relatively
young person (usually 35 years of age or younger) working in the field
of Physical Crystallography. It is to be expected that his or her
research has or is expected to make a significant impact in this field.
The 2002 award will be made during the Annual BCA Spring Meeting at the
University of York and the recipient will be expected to give an oral
presentation of his or her work at that meeting. The committee of the
Physical Crystallography Group (PCG, also known as the Structural
Condensed Matter Group of the IoP) decide on the awardee and PANalytical
sponsor the prize, which consists of a cash award of &pound;500 plus expenses
for attending the Spring Meeting to deliver the award lecture. The Award
will be presented by a representative of PANalytical.
<P>
Nominations should include a brief CV of the nominee; copies of the
papers on which the nomination is based (on which the main judgement is
made); and a supporting statement from the nominator, including comments
on the part the nominee has played in any research work published
jointly with others. Optionally, a nomination form is available from the
PCG Secretary
(<A HREF="mailto:john.evans@durham.ac.uk">john.evans@durham.ac.uk</A>) or
by clicking <A HREF="phform03.htm">here</A>.
Nominations of candidates from the same department as the nominator
are not normally allowed.
