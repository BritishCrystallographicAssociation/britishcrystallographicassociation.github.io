<h1>Report on Sessions at Cardiff March 95</h1>


<h3>Joint Physical Crystallography Group and British Association of Crystal Growth
Session on Growth and Physical Properties of Crystals.</h3>


        The joint sessions of the PCG and the BACG occupied the Wednesday
and Thursday mornings of the Cardiff Spring Meeting. The session commenced
with a plenary lecture entitlled `Generation and Characterisation of
Twinning in Crystals' by Professor Helmut Klapper of the University of Bonn,
who is a well-known expert in this field  Whereas the presence of domains in
crystals is often viewed by crystal growers and crystallographers alike as a
blight that must be eliminated, Professor Klapper showed how the study of
twinning and domains for `their own sake' is a fascinating and informative
pursuit. After delineating the laws governing the formation of twins,
Professor Klapper went on to describe optical and x-ray experiments for the
study of domains in a diverse range of crystals. He demonstrated how the
combination of polarized light microscopy and x-ray topography was powerful
in examining even the most complex domain structures. He also pointed out
that areas of controversy still remain in this well-established field of
study, for example, the argument about whether polar domains in the
energetically unfavourable head-to-head configuration can exist or not. The
lecture was of immediate relevance to those of us engaged in the study of
crystals and those wishing to grow domain-free single crystals and was,
therefore, an ideal start to the joint session.<p>

        In the second part of Wednesday morning's session, Chris Cousins of
the University of Exeter described his extensive experiments on electric
field-induced structural changes in the nonlinear optical crystals lithium
niobate, LiNbO3, and potassium titanyl phosphate, KTiOPO4. Chris clearly
communicated the wealth of structural information contained in x-ray data
collected from crystals under electric field and we were left in no doubt of
the very careful experimentation and analysis that must be undertaken in
order to ensure that artefacts are eliminated. His work is proceeding on a
number of fronts including diffractometry and x-ray topography with electric
field applied and, latterly, Laue work using the image-plate system at
Daresbury for the rapid simultaneous collection of a large quantity of
structural data. Chris described his recent results from KTiOPO4 in which
otherwise forbidden reflections appear as a result of the electric field
treatment. He has modelled this by a redistribution of the potassium ions
over the available sites, an approach that currently looks very promising.<p>

        This part of the session concluded with a short invited contribution
from Dr. Zheng-Wei Hu of Oxford and Warwick Universities who described his
latest research on periodically domain-inverted LiNbO3. Periodic
domain-inversion is the deliberate introduction of an array of domains of
alternating polariy into a polar material such as LiNbO3 by application of a
large electric field (220 Kv/cm). Dr. Hu is studying these domain-inverted
optical devices using a combination of high-resolution x-ray diffraction and
x-ray topography to examine the effects of the domain-inversion processing
on the crystal. He is then placing his results in a crystal structural
context by looking at the individual atomic displacements associated with
inversion of the crystal structure and the associated microstrains at the
domain boundaries.<p>

        So, whereas the session started with consideration of
naturally-occurring twinning in crystals, it finished with the study of
deliberately-induced domains. In the middle, it passed through what Chris
Cousins has been heard to call `electrical abuse' of crystals in pursuit of
the investigation of structural changes under electric field. In all, the
whole was of interest to PCG and BACG members alike and will no doubt spur
us on to further joint ventures in the future.<p>

<h2>Philips Physical Crystallography Award 1995.</h2>

        This year's winner of the Philips Physical Crystallography Award is
<strong>Dr. Werner Kaminsky</strong>
 who is currently working in Dr. Mike Glazer's group at
the Clarendon Laboratory. Dr. Kaminsky who received his research training in
Professor Haussuhl's Group of the University of Koln, obtained the award for
his elegant experiments in the field of crystal optics, particularly his
measurements of the gyration, electrogyration and magneto-optic tensors and
the variation of these tensor coefficients in the vicinity of structural
phase transitions.<p> 

        After accepting his award from Dr. Tom Ryan of Philips Analytical,
Dr. Kaminsky gave a most interesting presentation about his research. Having
correctly divined that his audience would not readily follow a thorough
exposition of 5th-rank tensor properties, Werner managed to give a
comprehensible account of his work whilst still conveying the complexity of
his subject - no mean feat! His demonstration of the change in the optical
characteristics of a ferromagnetic crystal with and without magnetic field
was as clear a demonstration of the magneto-optic effect as one could wish
to see. In his talk, Dr. Kaminsky brought home the wealth of interesting
information about crystals and their phase transitions that can be obtained
by the study of these complex physical properties. The audience was left in
no doubt that here was a very worthy winner of the 1995 Philips award.<p>
