<h1>Important notice to members of the BCA PCG</h1>
<h1>joining via the Institute of Physics</h1>
<p>
 In past years, it has been possible to join the BCA via the Physical  
Crystallography Group of the Institute of Physics. However, the joining  fee
for the Institute of Physics group is <strong>only £3 </strong>whereas the
cost of <strong>BCA  membership is £12,</strong> which covers an annual
charge of £10 for the four  issues of Crystallography News. It is obvious
that the £3 group joining fee  does not cover the cost of BCA membership. The
financial shortfall has  recently been recognized by both the BCA and the
IOP. Therefore a change  of arrangement has to be made to reflect the fact
that the cost of being a  full member of the BCA is £12. 

<p>
 After discussions with the Physical Crystallography Group Committee and 
BCA Council, the following has been decided for the calendar year 1997. 
<strong>
Membership of the Physical Crystallography Group of the IOP will no  longer
carry with it full BCA membership. </strong>
In order to obtain full BCA  membership,
providing with it four issues of Crystallography News per  year, IOP group
members will have to pay the difference between the group  fee and the BCA
membership fee i.e. £9.00, directly to the BCA on  completion of the
membership form which accompanies the December 96 issue of  Crystallography
News. If the balance is not paid, then Crystallography  News will cease to
be sent to you in 1997. However, you will retain  low-cost registration at
BCA events and will have access to news about  the BCA and Physical
Crystallography Group via the BCA World-wide Web pages. 

<p>
  We apologize for the inconvenience that this may cause to members, 
particularly those who have only just returned to the BCA lists after the 
Group Secretary's recruitment drive earlier this year. We hope that all  of
you will continue to opt for full BCA membership and elect to pay the  £9.00
balance to the BCA for this.<br>
