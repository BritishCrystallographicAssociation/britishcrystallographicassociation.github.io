The Philips Analytical Physical Crystallography Award is presented
annually for the best recently published work (say 2-3 papers in the last
few years) by a relatively young person
(usually 35 years of age or younger) working in
the field of Physical Crystallography. It is to be expected that his or
her research has or is expected to make a significant impact in this
field. The 2001 award will be made during the Annual BCA Spring
Meeting at the University of Reading and the recipient will be expected
to give an oral presentation of his or her work at that meeting. The
committee of the <A HREF="welcome.htm">Physical Crystallography Group</A>
(PCG, also known as the Structural Condensed Matter Group of
the IoP) decide on the awardee and Philips sponsor the prize, which
consists of a cash award of &pound;500 plus expenses for attending the Spring
Meeting to deliver the award lecture. The Award will be presented by
a representative of Philips Analytical.
<P>
Nominations should include a brief CV of the nominee; copies of the
papers on which the nomination is based (on which the main
judgement is made); and a supporting statement from the nominator,
including comments on the part the nominee has played in any
research work published jointly with others. Optionally, a nomination
form is available from the PCG Secretary
(<A HREF="mailto:c.c.wilson@rl.ac.uk">c.c.wilson@rl.ac.uk</A>) or by
clicking <A HREF="phform01.htm">here</A>.
Nominations of candidates from the same department
as the nominator are not normally allowed.
<P>
Nominations for this award should be sent,
