Below I have given a brief description of the sessions I found most useful
at the conference.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>1. Session o.m1.o</TD>
<TD>Ferroelectricity and NLO materials.
The most interesting and
informative talk I attended in this session was one given by F.
Laurell, titled "Micro-structured ferroelectrics for advanced optical
applications". His talk covered the history of periodically domain-
inverted structures, their manufacture, applications and future
work, which related directly to my Ph.D. project. Having studied
his predecessors' work it was very interesting to see how certain
techniques and ideas have advanced.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>2. Session o.m2.o</TD>
<TD>Perovskites: Materials of the 21st century. In the Crystallography
Group at Warwick University, of which I am a member, principal
research is into A-site perovskite substituted structures. This
session was very interesting and I was able to discuss many of the
topics raised with other members of the group.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>3.&nbsp;Session&nbsp;s7'.m1.o</TD>
<TD>Neutron Diffraction. My project does not involve any neutron
diffraction and my knowledge in this field is minimal, but this
session provided a very interesting insight into the underlying
principles as well as current research interests. I have to admit that
several of the more in-depth talks went over my head but I feel a
lot more confident approaching the subject now.

<TD VALIGN=TOP>4. Session o.m11.o</TD>
<TD>Teaching Crystallography. I found this session interesting
especially the talk given by A. M. Glazer, titled "Teaching
crystallography to reluctant physicists". A lot of fundamental
principles were presented in a basic yet amusing manner. Having
only recently finished my degree, which contained only a small
amount of crystallography, it was interesting to see how another
University, Oxford, would have taught this subject.
