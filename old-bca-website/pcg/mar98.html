<strong>Report from the PCG AGM</strong>
<BR>held on April 6th 1998 at the University of St. Andrews

Dr. V.M.Nield (University of Kent) and Dr. P. Kidd (Queen Mary College,
University of London) retired from the PCG Committee at the AGM held on
April 6th 1998. No new elections to the Committee were made although the
co-option of two people to assist the Committee in its work in 1998-1999 
was approved by the meeting. Details of those co-opted to the Committee 
will appear in the next issue of Crystallography News.

<P>
The AGM also approved a change of name of the Group from the Physical
Crystallography Group of the Institute of Physics to the Structural Physics
Group. For British Crystallographic Association purposes however, we shall
remain the Physical Crystallography Group of the BCA. The wheels have been
put in motion with the IOP to effect the change of name. The intention
behind this change is to have a name which reflects accurately the
activities of our members and reinforces our physics "profile" within the
IOP.<BR>

<h1><a name="Phil98">Philips</a> Physical Crystallography Award for 1998</h1>

<P>
The winner of the Philips Award for 1998 was <strong>Dr. Alison
Pawley</strong> from The Department of Earth Sciences at The University of
Manchester. She is currently active in the field of experimental petrology
and, during the past  number of years her research has been aimed at
improving our knowledge of mineral stability and phase relations in
subduction zones - in particular the stability of hydrous minerals. She
received the award for her achievements in placing constraints on the
conditions of dehydration of some important minerals in hydrated basalt and
peridotite in subducting slabs which, when  incorporated into thermal models
of subduction zones, are crucial for our understanding of processes such as
melting and the triggering of deep earthquakes.

After receiving her award from Dr. Rod Shipley of Philips Analytical
Research, Alison gave an interesting and extremely informative presentation
of some aspects of her research. Initially she outlined the importance of
water in the Earth's mantle and how break-down reactions of hydrated
minerals in subduction zones plays a pivotal role in the volcanism and
seismology of regions where tectonic plates collide. She then focused on her
X-ray diffraction studies of lawsonite
[CaAl<SUB>2</SUB>Si<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB>(OH)<SUB>2</SUB>.H<SUB>2</SUB>)]
and talc [Mg<SUB>3</SUB>Si<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>10</SUB>(OH)<SUB>2</SUB>]. As
this work requires the sample to be held at simultaneous high-pressure and
high-temperature, she initially described the development of the multi-anvil 
press on station 16.4 at the SRS Daresbury for in-situ energy-dispersive
x-ray  diffraction. For lawsonite she presented her comprehensive work in
the Cmcm and Pmcn stability regions and showed that lawsonite is stable to
depths greater than 300 km. On the other hand, talc was found to be stable
to only 150 km, where it transforms to the 10 Angstrom phase - which may
transport H<SUB>2</SUB>O to greater depths in the Earth. Further work is
ongoing to identify the water content of this phase. 

<P>
Alison's talk allowed the non-specialist audience to gain an insight into
one of the most exciting and extremely important fields of modern Earth
Science research and left us in no doubt that she is a worthy recipient of
the Philip's award for her excellent work in this branch of physical
crystallography.
