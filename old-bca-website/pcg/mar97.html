<h1><a name="Phil97">Philips</a> Physical Crystallography Award</h1>

<p>The winner of the Philips Award for 1997 was Professor Kenneth Harris from
the School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham. Professor Harris
received his prize both for his definitive work on the chemical physics of
one-dimensional urea inclusion compounds and for his work on ab initio
structure determination from powder diffraction data with the application
of Monte Carlo methods. The title of Professor Harris' talk on accepting
the award was "Physics and Chemistry of Molecular Solids". This
presentation focussed on the measurement and understanding of structural
and dynamic properties.

<p>Having introduced his talk with a summary of the wide range of techniques
used and his major research areas (solid inclusion compounds, properties of
incommensurate soluds, dynamic properties of rotator-phase solids and
development of structure solution from powder data), Professor Harris then
concentrated on one particular theme, namely urea-inclusion compounds. The
systems he described were based on one-dimensional chiral tunnel structures
typically described by space group P6122. The question of interest was how
various guest molecules could be fitted into the tunnel structures.

<p>According to the nature of host and guest, a variety of different
structures could result, some ordered commensurately and others
incommensurately. A typical example given by Professor Harris was the
accommodation of a guest structure of symmetry C2 in a host structure of
symmetry P6122. Not surprisingly, a degree of frustration arises in such a
system leading to the formation of domains, incommensurate modulation and
disorder. Professor Harris described how such systems had been investigated
using diverse experimental techniques and the state of present
understanding provided by his studies. He went on to point to the future of
these investigations suggesting, in particular, complete structure
determination of inclusion compounds using superspace groups, further
understanding of the incommensurate modulations and inter-tunnel orderings
of guest molecules and the investigation of interesting low-temperature
phase transitions.

<p>In the final part of his talk, Professor Harris described his recent work
on structure solution from powder diffraction data. His new strategy does
not require the intensities of individual reflections: instead, a
structural fragment is defined and is moved about the unit cell according
to a Monte Carlo algorithm, meanwhile comparing the observed and calculated
profiles. This methodology was extremely promising and further research is
ongoing.

<p>It was quite clear that the time allotted was too short for Professor
Harris to give an account of his many and varied activitie and, similarly,
space is too limited here to do them justice either. I am sure that
everyone in the plenary session of the BCA Spring Meeting that afternoon
would agree that Professor Harris' presentation was quite a tour de force
leaving us in no doubt of his worthiness to receive the Philip's award for
his excellent and diverse work in the realms of Physical and Chemical
Crystallography.   <br>

<h1><a name="Leeds"> Report </a>on the Physical Crystallography Group Sessions at the
 BCA annual spring meeting.</h1>

<p>
The PCG had two sessions at the 1997 BCA spring meeting, with the theme of
<strong>'Time-dependent structures and snap-shot techniques',</strong>
 organised by Dr Vicky
Nield (Kent) and Dr Chick Wilson (ISIS).  The PCG contribution commenced
with a plenary lecture by Professor Bob Cywinski from the University of St
Andrews.  After giving us a detailed overview of time-dependent diffraction
techniques, concentrating on the neutron diffraction case, Professor
Cywinski discussed some of his own work in the fields of magnetism and
superconductivity, where kinetic studies have proved invaluable.  Among the
highlights were thermodiffractometry experiments monitoring the appearance
and disappearance of new structural and magnetic phases, and the in situ
crystallisation of BSCCO superconductors, where the neutron diffraction
measurements were coupled with video monitoring of the appearance of the
sample. 

<p> The sessions were characterised by wide-ranging talks covering the
scientific applications of time-dependent studies, in areas as diverse as
biology and geology.  Dr Yeu Perng Nieh (Manchester) talked about his work
on the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase, where time-resolved synchrotron
Laue studies have been performed during reaction, allowing information on
the enzyme mechanism to be obtained.  Detailed electron density maps can be
constructed from the snapshot data, allowing the presence of transient
species to be identified.  The timescales of these experiments are dictated
by the read out time of the detectors, rather than by the required exposure
times.  Dr Mark Roberts (UCL/Daresbury) told us about the movable image
plate/mask assembly he is involved in developing for station 9.1 at
Daresbury, which is ideally designed for time-dependent studies of powders,
liquids and amorphous materials.  Dr Richard Jones (Keele), rounded off a
varied Wednesday morning by telling us about a selection of his in situ
studies of chemical reactions. The importance of experimental set-up was
stressed, including the requirements of sample cells in which the reaction
can take place.  Richard also stressed the importance of coupling the
experiment design to the nature and characteristics of the radiation being
used.  Among the highlights presented were examples of work on catalysts,
and zeolitic systems, using both X-ray and neutron diffraction methods.  

<p> The PCG oral poster session was again brilliantly chaired by Professor
Bruce Forsyth, ably assisted by the session organisers.  Excellent overviews
were provided of the 15 PCG posters, as well as of the 3 posters in the
General session, all in under 45 minutes!  The authors are to be
congratulated, as the quality was uniformly high and few fell foul of the
strictly imposed timing system.  The prize for the best PCG poster was
awarded to Dr Zhengwei Hu, from the University of Warwick, for his
fascinating work on phase contrast imaging of the periodically
domain-inverted nonlinear optic crystal LiNbO3.  There was also a prize for
the best neutron related poster, sponsored by the neutron scattering group
of the IOP and RSC.  This was awarded to Miss Halima Amer from the
University of Durham, for her ab initio calculations on proton transfer in
the amides, which allow comparison with inelastic neutron scattering data. 

<p> The Thursday morning session was organised jointly with the neutron
scattering group of the Institute of Physics and Royal Society of Chemistry,
and all four talks involved neutron diffraction work.  We kicked off with
geology, and Simon Redfern (Cambridge) gave an interesting talk on
"Geospeedometry" - the way in which in situ studies of the cation ordering
in olivines have been used to help in the understanding of the cooling and
thermal properties of igneous rocks in nature.  Simon showed that
traditional quenching techniques are inadequate in many cases where the
re-ordering happens faster than the quench.  Measuring in situ at high
temperature is thus important in obtaining correct values for the relative
populations and hence a knowledge of the conditions under which the material
has been formed.  Real time studies on the ferroelectric Rb2ZnCl4 exploiting
the pulsed nature of the ISIS source were discussed by Dr Mark Hagen
(Keele).  The phasing of the data collection with the rapid repetition of
the pulsed source (50Hz) presents a challenging problem.  Mark discussed the
electronics required and also the way in which statistics are improved by
repeated cycling of the reversible transition process.  Mr Matt Tucker
(Kent) gave an excellent contributed talk, selected from the submitted
posters, on his in situ studies of the crystallisation in nanocrystalline
zirconia.  The time and temperature dependence of the crystallisation
process has been studied from a variety of samples, and is now being related
to the structure. Professor Bruce Forsyth (Oxford) completed the stimulating
two-day PCG session and rounded off the BCA meeting by discussing some of
the possibilities for magnetic studies at ISIS.  Bruce showed how the
combination of high flux and resolution at the very long d-spacings
available using a cold neutron diffractometer can have powerful applications
in examining changes in magnetic structure as a function of temperature,
particularly incommensurate structures.<br>
