<h2>1999 PHILIPS PRIZE</h2>
The announcement of the 1999 Philips prize award to <B>Mark Harris</B>,
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, was made during the Closing Ceremony at the
IUCr XVIII in Glasgow. It was given for his work in the field of magnetic
frustration and, in particular, for his work in the area of magnetic
pyrochlores. Magnetic frustration has been known to occur in these materials
for over 40 years. Mark Harris and his co-worker Steve Bramwell were the
first to explain correctly the way in which frustration occurs. In addition,
Mark Harris has linked the ideas of magnetic frustration in a pyrochlore
ferromagnet to the ordering of protons in ice coining the term "spin ice"
recently discussed in Nature 399 311-2  (1999)
