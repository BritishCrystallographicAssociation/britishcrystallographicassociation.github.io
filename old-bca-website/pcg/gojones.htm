The 19th European Crystallography Meeting (ECM 19) was held between 25-31 August
2000 at the Faculte des Sciences, Universite Henri Poincare - Nancy.
In total 12 plenary
lectures were presented and 55 microsymposia running in parallel accompanied
by poster sessions throughout the conference.

This report outlines a brief summary of the sessions I found of most
interest/useful during
the conference.
Perovskites: Materials of the 21st century was an extremely interesting
session for me as it directly relates to my current Ph.D. research.
The session started with
an excellent introductory talk given by P. G. Radaelli, titled
"The crystallography of perovskites: past, present and future".
A historical view of perovskites was presented
covering many interesting areas within the field.
Other talks in this session included a
presentation by S. Garcia-Martin on "Perovskites as ionic conductors".
Another session, which I found particularly interesting, was "Teaching
Crystallography".  The first lecture was presented by A. M. Glazer,
entitled teaching crystallography to reluctant physicists,
it detailed ways that he has found over the years to improve the
teaching of this field to students in a hands-on manner.
A. D. Hunter, covering X-ray diffraction analysis
from high school through graduate school presented the final lecture of
this session.
This was a very amusing and informative lecture.
The Neutron Diffraction session was also
very instructive and of particular interest to my present area of research.
The lecture given by V. L. Jennings in the Ferroelectrics and Nonlinear optics
session was also interesting.
The talk started with a concise and informative description of the very
unusual A-site substituted perovskite Sodium Bismuth Titanate.
The structural phases as
a function of temperature were presented with the tilt systems and
structures being clearly
explained (this included the unusual tetragonal phase of this material).
The initial
descriptions were followed by a description of the model used in computational
simulations of the phases.
