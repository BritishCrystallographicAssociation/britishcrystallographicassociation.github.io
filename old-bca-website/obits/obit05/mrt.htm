<b>Jackie Truter (Lady Cox) died from leukaemia on 26 November 2004. Her career
in X-ray crystallography began in 1945 and at her death she was still active
as Visiting Professor in the Chemistry Department at University College,
London. She was the widow of <a href="../gc.html">Sir Gordon Cox</a> FRS.</b>
</p>
<p>
The following obituary draws heavily on the short autobiography she
completed in March 2004 for her family and friends; direct excerpts are in
quotation marks. 

<b>Mary Rosaleen Jackman</b> was born on 19 December 1925, the only child of
Douglas Jackman, research chemist and subsequently general practitioner, and
Agnes Browne, lecturer in chemistry. `Jackie' was the nickname she was given
when a Girl Guide in London. She was a scholar 1936-1942 at St. Paul's
Girls' School, which she loved. At the end of her first year at Imperial
College, London she "got a first in the special Inter BSc exam for intending
chemists, to the astonishment of people who assumed that with my looks I
could not have a brain". She graduated in 1945 with a II<sub>1</sub> in chemistry. 
</p><p>
A.J.E. Welch, who had given excellent lectures on crystal chemistry, started
her on research with X-ray powder photography. After hearing <b>Sir Lawrence
Bragg</b> at the Royal Institution she "was hooked on crystallography." In late
1946 she saw an advertisement for an assistant lecturer with `an interest
in, but no necessary knowledge of, crystallography'. She applied and got the
job in the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry at Leeds
University, starting in January 1947. Her fiancé <b>Dr. Eric Truter</b>, whom she
had met as a chemistry student at Imperial College, obtained a Fellowship in
the Leeds Textile Department and they married in March 1947.

<b>The University of Leeds 1947-1966</b><br>

 Her head of department <b>Professor E.G. Cox</b>
 "said that he would teach me and
then I should teach the post-graduate students. I started a new research
project and registered for the External PhD of the University of London. I
did not want to be registered in Leeds because people would discover how
young I was. I got the PhD in 1952".
</p><p>
 "The PhD problem was to determine the crystal structure
of nitronium perchlorate, NO<sub>2</sub>* ClO<sub>4</sub>. 
The crystals had to be kept out of contact with air; for comparison I also

studied Na*NO<sub>2</sub>. I took photographs, made visual

estimation of the greyness of the spots and did the necessary computations
with an electro-mechanical calculator and Beevers-Lipson strips." Soon she
joined in the development of punched card methods and computer programming.
She investigated S-O and S-C bond lengths in various valence states of
sulfur. This led on to comparisons of bond lengths in small molecules in
their crystals and as ligands in metal complexes. All the while she carried
a heavy teaching load. 
</p>
<p>
With her research students she achieved a considerable reputation with a
series of papers on trimethyl platinum compounds, arising from syntheses by
<b>R.C. Menzies</b> dating back to 1928. A paper in 1956 described a
di(trimethylplatinum) complex involving three ethylene diamines, only one of
which was bridging. Crystallographic methods had now reached a stage where C
and N could be located and distinguished despite the presence of Pt and I.
Of particular interest were the unusual structures of dimeric
trimethylplatinum &alpha; - diketonates in which each &alpha; - diketone made two O-Pt bonds
to one Pt and one C-Pt bond to the second Pt. New compounds were synthesised
to study the character of the relatively long sixth Pt-C bond in the
octahedral coordination around platinum. 
</p>
<p>
As a close colleague of Jackie's at Leeds, I found her unfailingly cheerful
and patient in tutoring me in chemical matters; reciprocally I appreciated
the good use to which she put my contributions to mathematical and
computational methods. My interest in tetrahedral oxyanions, and the
heuristic d&pi; - p&pi; bonding hypothesis, arose directly from her structures. We
were beneficiaries of Cox's leadership and his success in building up a
strong and lively all-round group in chemical crystallography. 
</p>
<p>
She was promoted Reader in Structural Chemistry in 1960. Shortly after, Cox
left to become Secretary of the Agricultural Research Council. He was
eventually replaced by an inorganic/analytical chemist. Her lab space was
reduced, and teaching with larger classes became less pleasant. In January
1965 her marriage with Eric Truter broke up. 
</p>
<p>
<b>London 1966 - 2004</b><br> 
In 1966 she was invited by <b>Prof. Ron Nyholm</b>,
 Head of Chemistry at University College, London, to become Deputy Director
of the ARC Unit of Structural Chemistry.
</p>
<p>
This was a new venture to allow him, as Honorary Director, to expand his
research interests into alkali and alkaline earth metal compounds. Since
there was insufficient space in College, the Unit started in October 1966 in
a government office building in the Strand. By 1968 the place had been made
into a proper laboratory with its own computer and automatic diffractometer.
There were four post-doctoral members of staff as well as visitors and
students.
</p>
<p>
 "I had taken a big risk because the idea was to look for complexes of
alkali and alkaline earth metal cations to see if we could understand and
even emulate the discrimination shown by biological systems between e.g.
sodium and potassium. We were not sure there would be any complexes but we
soon made some and then had the good fortune to determine the crystal
structures of several of Pedersen's crown ether complexes. [Pedersen, Nobel
laureate 1987, had shown by 1967 that macrocyclic ethers extract metal salts
into non-polar solvents and act selectively on these metals. He spent three
months in the Unit in 1969.] Many papers were published. Ron was delighted
with the progress of the Unit, and I was made a Professor of the University
of London". Jackie's 1973 review in Structure and Bonding of `Structures of
organic complexes with alkali metal ions' was an ISI Citation Classic in
1989. She received a Chemical Society Award for Structural Chemistry in
1976.
</p>
<p>
 In November 1962 Gordon Cox's wife Lucie had died of a heart attack. Jackie
married Gordon in May 1968. He retired as Secretary of the ARC in September
1971.
</p>
<p>
 In December 1971 disaster struck when Nyholm was killed in a road accident.
The whole future of the Unit was uncertain, but eventually the ARC decided
that it should be moved to Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire.
Initially scattered around the Rothamsted complex, the renamed Molecular
Structures Department moved in 1977 into purpose built accommodation.
</p>
<p>
 "Our work in Rothamsted remained the same as in London. We did a small
number of crystal structure determinations for other people in the
Agricultural Research Service (ARS), particularly the Unit of Nitrogen
Fixation; we had already done some pyrethroid insecticides before moving to
Rothamsted. The main thrust remained synthesising compounds with potential
to complex selectively with alkali and alkaline earth metal cations" and
examining the transport of these ions within biological systems,
particularly membrane transport. At Rothamsted, "we changed from an animal
(rat liver mitochondria in UCL) to a plant (opening of stomata in leaves)
bioassay." The Molecular Structures Department was a happy group and highly
productive in several areas.
</p>
<p>
 "When I joined Rothamsted officially, April 1973, morale was very high. It
was the oldest, biggest and best agricultural research institute in the
world. This continued during 1981 when the universities were hit by Mrs.
Thatcher's cuts. ... In the spring of 1983 the then Secretary of the ARC
(<b>Ralph Riley</b>) visited Rothamsted and other institutes to warn of coming
cuts. On Sept 7th 1983 the Director told me that I and all my staff were to
be made redundant, essentially because our work was too basic with no
immediate pay-off. His hope that we would all be gone by the end of March
1984 was not fulfilled as we fought back. The borrowed time allowed my staff
to get other jobs and I was given 6 months notice in July 1984. In November
1984 I moved out of Rothamsted and into a room in University College."
</p>
<p>
 There she did some teaching and, in the earlier years, continued with
research more or less full-time. She had mutually valued relations with both
her Jackman cousins and the Cox family. Gordon suffered increasing
ill-health from 1992 and died in June 1996. Her own leukaemia was first
diagnosed in 2002. In periods of remission, she continued to visit the
College. She died in November 2004. 
</p>
<p>
Especially as a younger woman, Jackie
cut an attractive figure, elegantly dressed and independently stylish. At
Leeds she entered fully into the general and social life of the University.
She was a founder member of the BCA, a past chairman of the CCG and a
trustee of the CCDC. At Rothamsted colleagues were always impressed with her
dedication ­ to the work, to her staff and students and to the laboratory.
Her many friends in the UK and around the world mourn her passing.
