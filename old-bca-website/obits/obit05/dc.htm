Des Cunningham, who died on 18<SUP>th</SUP> September 2006, was a Chemistry
Professor at the National University of Ireland, Galway (Ollscoil na
h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh). He was a much loved academic and his passing
represents a sad loss for the chemistry and crystallographic community in
Ireland. His research, (with more than 175 papers), principally focused on
the synthesis and characterisation of Group 14 derivatives using
M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, makes him a
key figure in the development and promotion of inorganic chemistry in
Ireland from the 1970s. 
</p>
<P>
He was born on March 6<SUP>th</SUP> 1942 and grew up in Mountcharles in
County Donegal, where his father was a school principal. In his early years
both music and painting competed with his interest in science. He chose
chemistry when a career decision had to be made and was educated at
University College Dublin. He studied synthetic inorganic chemistry
(1965-1968) on 'Studies on Chromium(III) Alkoxides' under the supervision of
Dr. W. K. Glass and was awarded a Ph.D. degree for this research from the
National University of Ireland.

Post-doctoral research in London, in the then Northern Polytechnic,
introduced Des to the chemistry of tin which subsequently became a lifelong
interest in conjunction with M&ouml; ssbauer spectroscopy. In 1971 he moved
to a lectureship in University College Galway and established a thriving
research group engaged in the study of Group 14 and transition metal
complexes. Research included synthetic and structural studies on metal
phenylphosphonates/phenylarsonates, heterobimetallic Schiff bases and metal
oxides.

Des had a strong interest in solid state chemistry and had often dreamed of
establishing a crystallography group in Ireland. In the late 1970s he spent
a year on sabbatical leave in Oklahoma, USA, where he gained considerable
expertise in using diffraction equipment and running a crystallography
laboratory. From this experience, the Crystallography Centre in Galway was
established with collaboration from Patrick McArdle and Tim Higgins.
Initially a Hilger &amp; Watts Y290 4-circle diffractometer was used for
data collection (from George Ferguson, University of Guelph, Canada). The
positive impact of this diffractometer was immediate, driving research in
new directions in synthetic and structural chemistry both in Galway and in
collaboration with other Irish research institutions. Two successive HEA
large equipment grants followed and provided further funding for more modern
equipment to  pursue and expand research in chemical crystallography, powder
diffraction and biological crystallography.

Des had extensive collaborations with industry in Ireland. A pharmaceutical
company had a major problem with a tin catalysed reaction using a process
that produced the desired drug in 1h but left a tin oxide 'mess' that took 
<I>many</I> hours to clean up. Production runs were limited to only one per
day. Des and co-workers overcame the problem using inexpensive chemicals by
turning the 'mess' into a white powder that was easier to handle. Production
was tripled in all plants in which the drug was produced (which represented
&gt;20% of the companies worldwide profits). More recently, he together with
co-workers developed a process for coating glass (and other materials) with
tin and other metal oxides. This process has been patented and is superior
to existing methods. These very thin oxide coatings make plate glass windows
and glass bottles much stronger than uncoated glass.

<P>
During his recent illness he was always optimistic and continued to involve
himself in much chemistry, correcting theses and suggesting reactions from
his hospital bed. Several fascinating compounds were synthesised by his
research students and their crystal structures solved and examined by him in
the days before he died.

The funeral Mass for Des was celebrated in Moycullen Church, Co. Galway. In
a ceremony that was punctuated by anecdote, verse and song, the congregation
were moved from tears to laughter. Afterwards, Des was laid to rest in the
graveyard beside Moycullen Church.
</p>
<P>
Des thought well of everyone and thus had more friends than most. The
wonderful atmosphere he could create with his personality, his music and his
love of painting will long be remembered by all who knew him. He was very
friendly and sociable,  and he appreciated a well poured pint of stout
amongst friends - a lifelong interest which had not diminished with age. He
was an excellent teacher, mentor and friend to the many students that he
taught as undergraduates or super vised as postgraduate students as well as
his colleagues and friends. He will be missed by the many people that he met
throughout his life.

Des was a dedicated family man and is survived by his wife Patsy, his daughter Aileen, his brother Conal and his sisters Shelia and Catherine.
