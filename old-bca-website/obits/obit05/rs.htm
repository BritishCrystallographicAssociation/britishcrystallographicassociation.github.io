It is with great sadness that I have to announce that Robin died in
hospital on Sunday, 27th March 2005. He had been suffering liver
problems since contracting Hepatitis A last November and these finally
proved fatal on Easter Sunday.
</p>
<p>
Robin was born in Harrow on 1st July 1941 and graduated from UCL in 1964
with a BSc in Chemistry. He joined the Department of Chemical Physics at
Battersea College in 1967 as an Assistant Lecturer in Crystallography
and moved to the Guildford campus shortly afterwards. Robin commenced a
secondment to Psychology in 1988 as a Senior Research Fellow in
Information Systems. This was combined with a collaborative arrangement
with the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford to allow for the continuation of
his crystallography research activities in x-ray powder diffraction and
crystallographic computational methods. The Psychology secondment
continued until 1997 when Robin formally transferred over to Psychology
in the new School of Human Sciences.
</p>
<p>
Robin assumed responsibility for teaching undergraduate statistics.
Despite this being an unpopular subject, he was much loved by the
students who valued his genuine concern to help them and his willingness
to spend that extra bit of time explaining things. Robin was accessible
to students and his student feedback often expressed gratitude for the
pastoral role he willingly assumed. As well as his software development
work for his crystallography research, Robin produced a complete
integrated suite of instructional programs intended to promote
understanding of statistical theory. It is unfortunate that more was not
made of the software which was very innovative for its time. Robin was
always keen to make improvements and he never regarded it as finished.
</p>
<p>
Although based in Psychology, Robin continued to develop and disseminate
his work on powder indexing presenting his ideas around the world. He
organised and contributed to the Crysfire 2001 suite of programs for
determining powder structures which is widely used in the academic
community and available in an industrial version. He continued to
develop and demonstrate the programs up to the time of his death. Robin
probably contracted the Hepatitis A during a visit to Egypt last
November for a 5-day International Powder Diffraction Workshop at Assiut
University. There his lectures went well but running his software for
the lab sessions proved to be difficult because the computers were
running an Arabic version of Windows!
</p>
<p>
In various committees and boards of studies Robin was notable for
arguing strongly for what was just and right. Unwilling to sit back and
let events pass him by if he thought something was not being dealt with
properly, he was sometimes in conflict with colleagues but his views
often prevailed and he gained respect as a man of principle. These
qualities were carried over into his Union activities. As Chair of the
local AUT branch Robin was intimately involved in a wide range of
activities and came into contact with many people across the University.
Initially a reluctant Chair, he became an effective negotiator on behalf
of AUT members. He was able to bring a rational, logical approach to
union activity and negotiations without ever losing sight of his
responsibilities to the members.
</p>
<p>
Robin will be remembered by many as someone who was very intellectually
sharp. He had an endearing habit of arriving late for Psychology
seminars yet would still be able to ask (usually the first) penetrating
questions that often got to the heart of the debates at hand. This was
all the more impressive as he was not, until relatively recently,
trained as a psychologist and still saw himself as a crystallographer,
computer scientist, and English poet. He had a genuine enthusiasm for
ideas of all kinds.
</p>
<p>
Away from work he was External Activities Coordinator and then Chairman
of the Wey Poets (Guildford & West Surrey Centre of the Poetry Society)
and he organised and took part in poetry readings and participated at
various festivals. He also lectured, published and broadcast on the
subject of computer poetry and the programmed generation of language
generally. He was a member of the Computer Conservation Society and used
to maintain a gallery of microcomputer exhibits at the Computer Museum,
Bletchley Park.
</p>
<p>
He will be remembered as someone who was always to be seen at social
events whatever they were. He was a Father Christmas at the
staff-student Christmas parties for a number of years and also the
target of many a fond student 'sketch' in the annual party review. He
was always portrayed sympathetically (not the norm for many staff)
reflecting the warmth and esteem with which the students regarded him.
</p>
<p>
Robin was one of the great characters of the University and he will be
missed.

<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
  <li>
  We are grateful to Lachlan Cranswick who had been contacted by
Robin Shirley's brother Peter, who is administering his estate, 
about Robin's recent death. At Lachlan's request, Peter E-mailed Lachlan
the obituary (above) written by the head of the Psychology department where
Robin worked, which was intended for staff and students at Surrey
University. We are grateful to Jeremy Cockcroft who forwarded the obituary
to the BCA web obituaries editor and to the University of Surrey who
permitted the wider distribution of the obituary for the information
of BCA members.<br><br>
  <li>Peter Shirley was concerned about the future of Robin's Crysfire
powder Indexing suite. On discussing this with him, it might be possible for
the estate to release a GPL'd (including source code) version of the
Crysfire powder indexing suite in the forseeable future. Robin left a lot of
papers, correspondance and around half a dozen computers for his estate to
currently work through.<br><br>

  <li><i>(from Kate Crennell)</i>
 I first met Robin at BCA meetings and we soon 
discovered a mutual interest in the preservation of an archive of old
personal computers.  Robin was the author of several articles in 
'Crystallography News' during my editorship:
<ul>
  <li>His poem exhibited at IUCr99 with other 
<a href="../../cnews/1999/iucr99/page7.html#poem">'Crystallographic Arts'</a>
was reported in 'Crystallography News' no. 70 September 1999 page 9 for the
benefit of those who had not seen it in Glasgow.
  <li>His article on <a href="../../ed/progs/robin.html">
'<b>Crysfire</b> - Automatic powder indexing for Non-Specialists'</a>
was published in the same issue on page 53

I was stunned today to receive the unexpected news that Robin Shirley had
died on Easter Sunday, 27th March 2005. I had not known that he had been
ill, and so this came as a complete surprise and a personal shock. It
appears that he contracted Hepatitis A last November, probably during a
visit to Egypt to attend a 5-day International Powder Diffraction Workshop
at Assiut University, and this led to acute liver problems, from which he
failed to recover.</b>

</p><p>
 Robin was born in Harrow on 1st July 1941 and graduated from UCL in 1964
with a BSc in Chemistry. In 1965, our paths first crossed, when I arrived in
<b>Kathleen Lonsdale's</b> laboratory in the basement of the Chemistry Department
of UCL to begin my postgraduate research. I well recall that on that first
day there, I was surprised by a jovial baldheaded Lenin-lookalike with a
loud voice bounding down the stairs from what we called the mezzanine floor.
Robin had joined the lab a couple of years earlier to work on the
crystallography of gall and bladder stones. Mrs Lonsdale had acquired a
large collection of these stones, ranging in size from less than 1 cm up to
one monster that was nearly as big as football, which Robin was most keen to
show to me. If I recall correctly it was labelled "Mrs Olive Green".
Needless to say, we quickly became friends, and "Mrs Olive Green" was often
mentioned whenever we met in later years.
</p><p>
 Robin, it has to be said, did not always hit it off with Mrs Lonsdale, and
so he developed a kind of love-hate relationship with her (although many
years later he did confide in me that looking back he realised how much he
was indebted to her). Part of the problem was that he could sometimes appear
to be abrasive, but this followed from a sharp and highly cerebral and
critical mind. He was someone who did not suffer fools gladly. But at the
same time he was warm and kind, especially to the other students in the
group, and could always be approached for useful advice and help. It was
Robin who first showed me how to use a polarising microscope, a technique
that has remained with me to the present day.
</p><p>
 In 1967, he was appointed to an Assistant Lectureship in Crystallography in
the Department of Chemical Physics at Battersea College (later to become the
University of Surrey). It was then that he turned his attention to the
problem of automatic indexing of powder patterns and he wrote an influential
review of all the techniques then available, which is still read today.
However, it seems that he didn't quite see eye to eye with some members of
the Department and in 1988 he moved to the Department of Psychology as a
Senior Research Fellow in Information Systems. I was very happy during this
time to be able to offer Robin and his PhD student laboratory space in
Oxford while he sorted out his position at the University.
</p><p>
 The Psychology secondment continued until 1997 when Robin formally
transferred over to Psychology in the new School of Human Sciences. Here he
taught undergraduate statistics, which, despite being an unpopular subject,
won the approval of his students. Indeed it is reported that they loved him
for his genuine concern to help them and his willingness to spend extra time
to explain things. I understand that he produced a complete integrated suite
of instructional programs intended to promote understanding of statistical
theory. 
</p><p>
Several years ago, he was struck by serious personal tragedies that would
have derailed most people, and indeed for a few years, he vanished from the
Crystallography scene. I was delighted when he eventually resurfaced at a
Crystallography conference to rekindle his involvement in the problem of
powder indexing. As is well known, he began to put together the CRYSFIRE
suite of programs, in which different powder indexing software was joined
together in such a way that the user could easily migrate from one type of
indexing program to another. CRYSFIRE rapidly established itself as an
influential development, and very soon, Robin was invited everywhere that
powder indexing was to be discussed and he was a popular figure at
Crystallography conferences world-wide.
</p><p>
 Readers may like to know that Robin was also a wellrespected poet, having
participated at several poetry festivals. He also lectured, published and
broadcast on the subject of computer poetry and the programmed generation of
language generally. He was a member of the Computer Conservation Society. A
few years ago I was fortunate to be invited to the Science Museum to see the
unveiling of a Ferranti Pegasus Mark II computer that he and the Society had
managed to restore and get working. This was the very same machine that I,
Howard Flack and Robin used during our graduate research, and I believe that
it is now the only working valve computer in the world. Robin and I felt
quite nostalgic when it was switched on to play Teddy Bear's Picnic and
Rocking through the Rye (we used to play this during long hours at night
working on this machine). You can see this for yourself today in the
computer gallery of the Science Museum. 
</p><p>
Robin was a larger than life figure, a real character, and I shall miss him.
