<h2>PROFILES in SCIENCE</h2>

The U.S National Library of Medicine has set up a website featuring
twentieth century leader in biomedical research and public health. It holds
archival  collections of prominent scientists, physicians and others who
have advanced scientific enterprise. It can be found at URL
<a href="http://profiles.nim.nih.gov/SC/">http://profiles.nim.nih.gov/SC/</a>

Collections for biomedical research include:
<ul>
  <li> Francis Crick
  <li> Barbara McClintock 
  <li> Linus Pauling
</ul>
 Here is a summary of their holdings on Francis Crick.<br><br>

<h4>The Francis Crick Papers</h4>

The name of Nobel laureate Francis Crick (1916-2004) is inextricably 
tied to the discovery of the double helix of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 1953, considered the most 
significant advance in the understanding of biology since 
Darwin's theory of evolution. Yet, during a research career 
spanning more than fifty years, theoretical biologist Crick 
also made fundamental contributions to structural studies 
of other important biological molecules through X-ray analysis; 
to the understanding of protein synthesis; to the 
deciphering of the genetic code by which hereditary 
information is stored and transcribed in the cell; and to 
our conception of consciousness.  Through force of 
personality and intellect, readily apparent in this online 
selection from his papers, the Briton served as a one-man 
clearinghouse of criticism, ideas, and information for 
scientists the world over.

The Wellcome Library for the History and Understanding of 
Medicine in London is the repository for the scientific papers of Francis 
Crick (collection reference PP/CRI). 
The archive contains correspondence, lecture notes, photographs, 
laboratory notebooks, and published and unpublished articles, 
which range from 1938 to ca. 2002. 
</p><p>
The section of the papers containing Crick's work in 
molecular biology (1938-1998) is catalogued  and available 
for study in the Wellcome Library.  The section of his 
papers on consciousness research is currently being 
catalogued and will be available in the future.

Individuals or institutions wishing to reproduce or 
request copies of the documents should contact the
 Wellcome Trust Medical Photographic Library at URL

</p><p> 
As part of its Profiles in Science project, 
the National Library of Medicine has collaborated with the Wellcome Library
to digitize and make available over the World Wide Web a selection of 
the Francis Crick Papers for use by educators and researchers. 
This site provides access to the portions of 
the Francis Crick Papers of the Wellcome Library
that have been selected for digitization.

Individuals interested in conducting research in the Francis Crick Papers 
are invited to contact the Wellcome Library, further details at

This online Exhibit is designed to introduce you to the various phases of
Dr. Crick's  scientific career and professional life. It is divided into
sections that focus on  Crick's life and major scientific contributions.
