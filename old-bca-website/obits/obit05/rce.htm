<P>
Robert Crispin Evans died peacefully on 18<SUP>th</SUP> December 2005 at the
age of 96. As well as being the oldest of our Honorary Members, he  was
senior Emeritus Fellow of St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, and was also
the last surviving founder of the IUCr.</p>

<P>
Robert Evans was born in November 1909 in Wallington, Surrey, to a business
family.  He was educated at Repton School, Derbyshire, and Clare College,
Cambridge, which he entered in 1928. He also had a B.Sc in physics from
London University, which he apparently took as an external student while he
was an undergraduate at Cambridge!   He was a research student in physics at
the Cavendish Laboratory and gained his Ph.D. in 1934 for a thesis was
entitled 'The evaporation of ions and atoms of the alkali metals from hot
surfaces'.  Two of the papers from this work were communicated to the Royal
Society by his official supervisor Lord Rutherford.</p>

<P>
Evans became a member of the staff in the Department of Mineralogy and
Petrology at Cambridge in 1933, serving as Demonstrator 1933-1945 and as
Lecturer 1945-1977.  During World War II, from 1940 to 1945, Evans was with
the Ministry of Supply where he worked on shell ballistics and experimental
firings.  He returned to Clare College in 1945 and was elected a Fellow of
St Catharine's College in 1947.</p>

<P>
He gave extremely well received lectures that he illustrated with models
mainly conceived and constructed himself.  His lecture demonstrations of
crystal optics and microscopy were notable.  He built an electromagnetic
mineral separator that was a great improvement on previous instruments and
was much used by research students.  Among other devices that he worked on
with colleagues were a mechanical machine for the computation of
two-dimensional structure factors and a concentrating X-ray monochromator. 
In essence, he was a tutorial don, who was not driven, as university staff
are today, by the need to research and publish.  Rather, he was a teacher
and mentor to generations of students.  His major academic contribution was
his comprehensive book on <I>Crystal Chemistry</I>, published in 1939. The
idea for this book arose from his translation of the short book
<I>Kristallchemie</I> (1934) written in German by O. Hassel of Oslo.  The
preface acknowledges that he had been actively aided and encouraged by J.D.
Bernal, who in 1937 had left Cambridge for Birkbeck College, London.  The
chapter on molecular compounds had been discussed with Dorothy Crowfoot
(Hodgkin).</p>

<P>
<I>Crystal Chemistry</I> omits any discussion of X-ray methods.  It opens
with chapters on the crystal lattice, interatomic binding forces, and
quantitative lattice theory (Born, London, Pauling, Bloch, Seitz <I>et
al.</I>)  One can see how his thesis work would have stimulated his interest
in these topics.  Much the larger part of the book is on systematic crystal
chemistry.  When his tasks with the IUCr had finished in 1960, he was able
to complete a second edition of <I>Crystal Chemistry</I> in 1964. </P>
 
<P>
Evans was a key figure in the first years of the International Union of
Crystallography and carried undoubtedly the largest single work load.  XRAG,
the predecessor of the BCA and led by Sir Lawrence Bragg, arranged an
international scientific conference 'X-ray Analysis during the War Years' in
London in July 1946.  Afterwards, the Provisional International
Crystallographic Committee of 31 persons from 11 countries met on 12 and 13
July with Lawrence Bragg and David Harker as joint Chairman, and Evans as
Acting Secretary.  This meeting, which decided to create a Union and develop
a journal and other publications, was effectively the 'Zeroth General
Assembly of the IUCr'. Evans and Paul Ewald were heavily involved in
launching the new journal <I>Acta Crystallographica</I>.  Money had to be
raised, including grants from UNESCO, and from industrial and other sources
in the UK and USA.  A publisher had to be chosen: Cambridge University Press
was selected.  Manuscripts had to be sought and printed.  Remarkably, the
first issue of <I>Acta Crystallographica</I> appeared in April 1948.</p>

<P>
Robert Evans was Secretary of the Provisional International Committee
(1946), then General Secretary of the interim Executive Committee (1947),
and then General Secretary of the Union from its formal inauguration in 1948
for the first two triennia until 1954. In addition, he was a Co-editor of
<I>Acta</I> from its launch in 1948 until 1960, and carried the very
demanding load as Technical Editor until 1958 by which time <I>Acta</I> was
three times its initial size.</p>

<P>
Evans' responsibilities concerned the arrangement of the formal business of
the Union to be transacted at the sessions of the General Assembly.   
Actually, this formal business was transacted without real difficulty,
despite Ewald's initial attempt as Chairman to create the Union by the
acclamation of the entire audience of Congress participants rather than by
the votes of the official delegates. "Evans somehow rescued me" Ewald wrote
later.  In fact, at that time there were only four members - the Adhering
Bodies of Canada, Norway, UK and USA - indeed when Evans was making
preparations, the number of formal members, as he wrote later, "could be
counted on the thumb of one hand".  Ewald and Evans, with their different
styles, formed a very effective duo for the accomplishment of the necessary
business.  </p>

<P>
Evans was a careful scientific and technical editor. He had a genuine
interest in all aspects of print production.  I remember being invited to
his office in Cambridge in 1949.  In those days, the text of papers was
typewritten, but equations and symbols were inserted by hand.  He pointed
out kindly the ambiguities in my handwriting and showed me something of the
way a paper should be marked up for the printer.  In 1954 he gave a talk at
an XRAG meeting in Cambridge about the work of an editor.  He illustrated
his talk by mentioning some of the problems in submitted papers.  As each
infelicity was mentioned, he raised his head a little and nodded gently to
the relevant culprit in the audience.</p>

<P>
In 1955 he married Betty Bond, whom he had met when she was a librarian in
the Scientific Periodicals Library.  She survives him; they had no children. 
Their home in Elsworth, a village outside Cambridge, was an important focus
for hospitality of all kinds, and not least, hospitality to students.</p>

<P>
After retirement in 1977 he had two hobbies, one as a beekeeper and the
other by opening his small workshop to encourage the youths of the community
to learn skills in wood work activities.  He was a kindly person, generous
with his wisdom, but somewhat reserved in manner.  However, on a public
platform there was a side of Robert that could perform to great effect.  He
was not a joke teller, but he could make a remarkably effective and witty
speech, simply by his choice of words and timing.</p> 

<P>
For his 90<SUP>th</SUP> birthday celebrations at St Catharine's College, the
anecdotes he related included the following.  The Cavendish Laboratory,
where he was a research student, was enjoying its most illustrious epoch
"not only because I was there" but because no fewer than 8 Nobel Laureates
were there too.  On one occasion Einstein was visiting Cambridge and made a
tour of the Laboratory accompanied by Lord Rutherford and J. J. Thomson, who
was Rutherford's predecessor and discoverer of the electron.  The party
visited a practical class in which Robert was demonstrating and after their
departure he was asked by one of the students "Who were those other
gentlemen with Einstein?"</p>

<P>
On Monday 7<SUP>th</SUP> April 1997, fifty years after, its inception, the
IUCr invited Evans to visit Chester to open the latest extension to its
offices.  He spoke of the creation and early days of the Union.  One of the
major reasons for inaugurating a new Union was the desire to launch a
journal of the highest standards to serve the entire crystallographic
community.  Appropriately, the Union's first half-century was celebrated in
the place where its family of six journals was being produced with the most
modern of computer technology.  Very fittingly, the celebrations were
enhanced by the presence of the last surviving founder of the Union: Robert
Evans.</p>
