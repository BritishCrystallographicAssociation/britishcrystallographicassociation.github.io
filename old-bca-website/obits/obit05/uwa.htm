<b>Ulrich Wolfgang Arndt</b> was born in Berlin in 1924, to parents with mixed
German-Russian-Dutch origins. His family moved to London in 1936 to escape
the increasingly repressive atmosphere in Germany, and Uli went to school at
Dulwich College. After initially specialising in Classics, he switched to
science, in spite of the fact that this was held in low esteem by many at
the time.  Following another family move, he finished his schooling at King
Edward's School in Birmingham and spent a year at Birmingham University
before going to Emmanuel College, Cambridge to read Natural Sciences in
</p><p> 

While still at Birmingham, Uli had met <b>Max Perutz</b> briefly following an
introduction by family friends. Uli greatly enjoyed his time in Cambridge,
and took full advantage of the many College and University societies, being
particularly active in the Emmanuel Debating Society. Because of war-time
restrictions, he was allowed to spend only two years at Cambridge, and after
obtaining a first at the end of his freshman year opted to complete the
Tripos in two years rather than the usual three. Despite recording the best
Physics Tripos of his year, his final degree was only a II-2, but this did
not prevent him from enrolling as a PhD student in the Crystallography
Department of the Cavendish Laboratory, then run by <b>Henry Lipson</b>.
 His work
involved characterising iron-copper-nickel alloys using a Debye-Scherrer
powder camera. Uli quickly decided that the photographic methods in use at
the time were too tedious and inaccurate, and decided to build a
diffractometer equipped with a Geiger counter to do the job. Making
extensive use of Government surplus supplies, he succeeded in his task by
the time he left Cambridge in 1948, but unfortunately had not recorded
sufficient experimental data to write up his thesis. 
</p><p>
He then joined <b>Wally Hall</b> at Birmingham University as a Research Fellow, and
drew on his experiences at Cambridge to design and build one of the very
first precision diffractometers. This finally yielded sufficient material
for his thesis, although all the writing had to be done in his spare time. 
</p><p>
In 1949, he moved to London to join <b>Dennis Riley</b>
 at the Royal Institution. 
Here he developed a compact rotating anode generator and several automatic
diffractometers for low angle diffraction, again making extensive use of
Government surplus equipment.  Realising the limitations of Geiger counters,
he developed some of the first proportional counters, making use of
equipment from the vaults of the RI left over from Dewar's work on
liquefaction of gases. Following Pauling's publication of the alpha-helical
model for proteins in 1951, Uli and Dennis were able to determine the radial
distribution function of bovine serum albumin and found excellent agreement
with that predicted by Pauling's model. This provided some of the first
experimental support for the alpha-helix, although subsequent work showed
that the agreement was largely fortuitous! <b>Lawrence Bragg's</b> arrival as
Director at the RI led to a change in focus towards single crystal
diffractometry, and a very fruitful collaboration began with
 <b>David Phillips</b>in 1955. This led to the development of the linear diffractometer,
controlled by an analogue computer, which was used to collect some of the
data for <b>Kendrew's</b> 5&Aring; resolution structure of myoglobin. 
</p><p>

A collaboration with <b>Terry Willis</b> at Harwell resulted in a greatly improved
version of the diffractometer for neutron work, and an X-ray version of this
instrument was subsequently commercialised very successfully by Hilger and
Watts. Uli and Terry's collaboration also led to the publication a few years
later of the classic monograph <i>"Single Crystal Diffractometry"</i>.
</p><p>

Uli's pioneering work in instrumentation and automation had not gone
unnoticed, and in 1962 <b>Max Perutz</b> invited him to join the newly founded 
Medical Research Council
Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.  Uli took up the invitation
the following year. The challenge of measuring the many thousands of
reflections required for protein work led him to re-examine the possibility
of using the only two-dimensional detector available at the time, namely
X-ray film. This in turn led to the development of automatic densitometers
to speed up the measurement of film data recorded with precession cameras.
Uli soon realised that the availability of scanning densitometers eliminated
the requirement for the spots to lie on straight lines, opening up the
possibility of using screenless oscillation photography. In the late 1960's
Uli's PhD student, <b>Paul Phizackerley</b>,
 investigated the potential of this
method, and this led to the development, with <b>Alan Wonacott</b>, of the
Arndt-Wonacott oscillation camera, marketed by <b>Enraf Nonius.</b>
 This device
revolutionised data collection methods, and cameras were soon to be found in
almost all the protein crystallography laboratories throughout the world.
Indeed, although film has since been replaced by electronic area detectors,
the rotation method remains the standard procedure for macromolecular data
collection. An international meeting on the use of the rotation method was
organised by <b>David Blow</b> in 1975, and the proceedings were published in a
monograph edited by Uli Arndt and Alan Wonacott (who jointly contributed 11
of the 17 chapters), which rapidly became a standard work.
</p><p>
 In fact, the
oscillation camera was only intended to be a short-term solution, as Uli's
real ambition lay in developing a fully electronic area detector based on TV
cameras. In the event, it was many years before this detector, the FAST,
became commercially available, and the oscillation camera remained the
workhorse in many laboratories until the late 1980s. By this time the FAST
faced stiff competition from multiwire chambers, and subsequently from image
plate detectors, and it never achieved the same level of popularity as its
more humble pr edecessor. Despite the shortcomings of a relatively small
active area, technical improvements to the original design (a double buffer)
allowed it to collect oscillation data in a "shutterless" mode, a highly
desirable feature that is still not possible with modern CCD detectors.
</p><p>

Although never attracted to working at large scale facilities such as
synchrotrons (he was always much happier working with the LMB electronic and
mechanical workshops), Uli was inevitably drawn into committees involved
with the design of instrumentation for the new generation of X-ray sources.
This led him to take a fresh look at focussing optics for use with
laboratory sources. A literature search revealed a source of toroidal
mirrors designed originally for X-ray astronomy, and theoretical
calculations suggested that if these were combined with a very small focal
spot size then it would be possible to obtain a brightness comparable with
rotating anode generators from a sealed tube running at a fraction of the
power. 
</p><p>
By this time Uli had reached retirement age, but the microfocus system was
his idea of an ideal retirement project. Together with Peter Duncumb and Jim
Long, both experts in electron optics, and supported by grants from the
Royal Society, Uli spent the next ten years bringing the project to
fruition. The tube/mirror system was marketed by <b>Bede Scientific
Instruments</b>, and performed remarkably well.
 It seems likely that his work in
this area strongly influenced the development of microfocus sources by the
much larger commercial X-ray equipment manufacturers, which have effectively
replaced the more conventional designs that had remained almost unchanged
for twenty years. Uli was not one to rest on his laurels, and was actively
engaged on designing and fabricating improved mirror optics until a few
weeks before his death.

Uli was very much a feature of life at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
With his trademark bow tie and, until smoking was finally banned, his pipe,
he was often to be seen in the canteen explaining his latest ideas on
improving his designs, often with the aid of a picture scribbled on a paper
napkin or an envelope. He was also an excellent story-teller, with a host of
amusing anecdotes to hand. His autobiography entitled "Personal X-ray
Reflections", soon to be published, is sure to provide entertaining insights
into the life of one of the most influential figures in X-ray
instrumentation.
