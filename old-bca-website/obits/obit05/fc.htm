<b>Francis Harry Compton Crick</b>, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology
or medicine with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the
structure of DNA, died July 28th 2004 after a long battle with colon cancer.
He was 88.

To those who knew him best, it was Crick's insatiable curiosity about life
and the creativity of his mind that set up him apart from others. In recent
years, he put these qualities to work in an attempt to find the neural
correlate of consciousness, a problem he defined as the search for the link
between the mind and the brain. Although he was a pathfinder in this young
field, he knew that it would take younger minds than his to one day untangle
the myriad mysteries of the human brain. When asked what he hoped his future
contributions would be, Francis said, "To excite younger people to study the
problem of consciousness." Christof Koch, a professor of neuroscience at
Caltech and one of Crick's collaborators said "Francis delighted in playing
the important role of devil's advocate for several generations of young
researchers."</p>

Born in Northampton, England, on June 8, 1916, Francis Crick showed an early
curiosity for all things, but for science in particular. To help answer his
many questions, his parents Harry Crick and Annie Elizabeth Wilkins bought
their young son a Children's Encyclopedia that covered a vast range of
topics, from history and music to science. But the subjects that intrigued
him the most centered on things like the nature of the galaxy, chemistry and
how things were made of atoms. Later, Crick studied physics at University
College in London, where he received a bachelor of science degree in 1937.
He began studying for his Ph.D., but this work was interrupted by the
outbreak of war in 1939. During World War II, he worked as a scientist for
the British Admiralty, helping to design magnetic and acoustic mines.</p>

When the war ended, however, Crick found himself less interested in physics
and somewhat vague about what he wanted to do with his future. "I still
didn't know much about anything so I could go into whatever I wanted," Crick
recalled in 1997 during an honors seminar lecture at Rutgers University. "I
used what I call the <I>Gossip Test</I> to decide what I wanted to do," he
said. "The gossip test is simply that whatever you find yourself gossiping
about is what you're really interested in. I had found that my two main
interests which I discussed the most were what today would be called
molecular biology, what I referred to as the borderline between living and
the nonliving, and the workings of the brain." </p>

<P>
In 1947, Crick turned to studies in biological research at the Strangeways
Laboratory in Cambridge, At that time, Crick knew little biology and
practically no organic chemistry or crystallography, however he soon went
beyond the fundamentals in each of these areas. In 1949, he joined the
Medical Research Council (MRC), and in 1951 met James Watson, a young
American graduate student. Two years later the two men used their respective
knowledge of genetics and X-ray diffraction, along with X-ray images from
Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, to determine the structure of DNA.
Crick and Watson subsequently suggested a general theory for the structure
of small viruses. Later, in research with Sydney Brenner, Crick developed
ideas about protein synthesis <I>(the adaptor hypothesis)</I> and the
genetic code.</p>

<P>
By 1966, sensing that the foundation for molecular biology was adequately
set, Crick turned his attention to embryology. Then, in 1976, he joined the
Salk Institute for a sabbatical year away from the MRC. The following year,
he left the UK for the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA, where he pursued his
interests in understanding the brain and the nature of consciousness. </p> 

<P>
In the epilogue of his book <I>What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of
Scientific Discovery,</I> Crick says that the brain sciences today
are reminiscent of the state of molecular biology and embryology in the
1920s and 1930s. "The brain sciences still have a very long way to go," he
writes. "But the fascination of the subject and the importance of the
answers will inevitably carry it forward. It is essential to understand our
brains in some detail if we are to assess correctly our place in this vast
and complicated universe we see all around us." A new Center for
Computational and Theoretical Biology at the Salk Institute will bear
Francis Crick's name.</p>

Aside from more than 130 published papers in his life, Crick also wrote
several books including:
<ul>
  <li> <I>Molecules and Men</I> (1966), 
  <li> <I>Life Itself</I> (1981),
  <li> <I>The Astonishing Hypothesis, 
  <li> </I>and <I>The Scientific Search for the Soul</I> (1994). 
</ul>
In addition to the Nobel Prize, his honors
included the Lasker Award, the Award of Merit from the Gairdner
Foundation, and the Prix Charles Leopold Meyer of the French Academy of
Sciences. He was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the
Royal Society, the French Academy of Sciences and the Irish Academy.

Crick is survived by his wife, the artist Odile Speed; two daughters by this
marriage, Gabrielle A. Crick and Jacqueline M-T Nichols, both residing in
England; a son by a previous marriage, Michael F.C. Crick of Seattle, and
six grandchildren. Crick was divorced from his first wife, Ruth Doreen Dodd,
in 1947.</p>
