George Jeffrey, Emeritus Professor of Crystallography at the University of
Pittsburgh, and, for many years, chair of the first academic crystallography
department in the USA, died on 13 February 2000 after several months
suffering from the progressive muscle disease ALS. His loss will be mourned
by his wife, Maureen, daughter Susan, son Paul, and their families; he will
be remembered by crystallographers worldwide.</p>

<P>
Jeff's evident enjoyment of the challenge of elucidating and discussing fine
details of molecular structure characterised his perceptive contributions,
delivered in idiosyncratic intonation and interspersed with his distinctive
chortle, at countless international meetings. His immense lifetime
contributions to the study of molecular bonding as revealed by X-ray and
neutron diffraction were recognised by awards from the ACA (of which he had
been Treasurer and President), ACS (twice), RSC and the Humboldt Foundation;
they were also celebrated at a series of special symposia spread across his
scientifically active financial retirement. In the first of these (Division
of Carbohydrate Chemistry, ACS, Atlanta, GA, 1981 ), Jeff's own
contributions on bifurcated hydrogen bonds in pyranoside crystals and on
anhydrocellobiose symmetry in cellulose fibres, stemmed from some of his
active interests in the UK 30 years earlier. Since Jeff's post-1953 career,
based in Pittsburgh (apart from '74-'76 at Brookhaven), may be emphasised
elsewhere, this appreciation highlights earlier UK achievements which
included several landmark papers in <em>Proc.Roy.Soc.(P.R.S.>).</em

George Alan Jeffrey was born in Cardiff on 29 July 1915 and educated at King
Edward's School, Birmingham and Birmingham University. Following his B.Sc.
in 1936, Jeff was assigned by W.N. (later Sir Norman, Nobel Laureate)
Haworth to research with Dr. E.G. (later Sir Gordon) Cox on the structure of
alpha-chitosamine (whether gluco- or mannosamine). This was a time, Jeff
said later, when solving organic crystal structures had great intellectual
appeal, "like playing chess against nature", but involved much tedium. For
both hydrochloride and the isomorphous hydrobromide (P2<SUB>1</SUB>), about
800 intensities were recorded on an oscillation camera with Al screens,
scaled experimentally, and evaluated by micro-photometry. 3-D Patterson and
Fourier series, calculated on an adding machine with the new Beevers-Lipson
strips, eventually revealed, in the first structure analysis of a sugar,
that alpha-chitosamine was a glucopyranose derivative in approximately the
chair conformation. Remarkably, the atomic positions of the non-H atoms
(except for the  CH<SUB>2</SUB>OH group) published in the 1939
<em>Nature</em> note were within 0.1 &Aring; of those he determined with
S.S.C. Chu from the same data 25 years later (<em>P.R.S.</em>, 1965).</p>

<P>
In Summer 1939, with the War about to start, G.A. Jeffrey joined the
fundamental research staff (later to include A.D. Booth) of the BRPRA
(British Rubber Producers' Research Association,  Director, John Wilson),
but continued at Birmingham in the X-ray labs (which one morning contained
an unexploded bomb) until 1941. Jeff later contended that in the 1940s and
l950s some of the most intractable fundamental problems in materials science
were being tackled by the Research Associations such as BRPRA. Part of his
wartime work was to help optimize natural-rubber usage (and to X-ray samples
from shot-down German aircraft), which led to joint papers in
(<em>J.Chem.Soc.</em>, l944, 1945, 1948), (<em>Trans.Inst.Rubber
Industry,</em> l943), etc. However, as part of a systematic small-molecule
approach towards the structure of rubber, Jeff determined the crystal
structure of beta-isoprene sulphone (<em>Tran.Farad.Soc.</em>, 1942),
confirming the heterocyclic structure and suggesting hyperconjugation. This
was followed at Welwyn by a series of papers on polyisoprenes, including
beta-guttapercha (<em>Tran.Farad.S.</em>, 1944) and, notably, geranylamine
hydrochloride (<em>P.R.S.</em>, 1945), a 3-D analysis which involved a
prodigious amount of hand calculations. The apparently anomalously short
central C-C band (originally thought to be accurate to 0.04 &Aring;) led to
an accurate refinement of dibenzyl (<em>P.R.S.</em>, 1947) and ultimately to
demonstration of the crucial importance of series-termination
corrections.</p>

<P>
In 1945, Cox, now Professor at Leeds, appointed Jeff, now married (1942)
with a family, lecturer in what became a large and distinguished school of
researchers in molecular structure and the solid state. Of the several
crystallographic themes encouraged by Cox, Jeff concentrated on accurate
structure analyses as a probe of bond character, especially for C-C bonds in
organic compounds (e.g. in dimethyltriacetylene) and for C-S, C-N, and N-O
bonds in organic (e.g. thiophthen) and inorganic compounds.</p>

<P>
Enthusiastic application of the techniques of refinement (differential
syntheses, correction for series termination) and accuracy assessment,
proposed by Booth at BRPRA and developed by Cruickshank at Leeds, yielded a
series of <em>J.Chem.Soc.</em> papers with students. Experimental structure
factors were still derived from laborious visual examination of spots on
multiple film packs; the state of X-ray structure determination in the early
l950s is well described by Jeff and Cruickshank in a
<em>Quart.Rev.Chem.Soc.</em> (1953) article.</p>

<P>
Concurrently, pioneering work with collaborators on mechanical BTM/IBM
punched-card methods of computation, first at the Electricity Board and then
with crystallographers operating the large machines in the lab., speeded up
analyses of many structures and led to several computation-technique papers.
Even so, each accurate (0.01 &Aring;) analysis was costly in scientific time
and money and, in a discussion (<em>P.R.S.</em>, 1951) on C-N and C-S<BR>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">p</FONT>-bonding, Cox and Jeff counselled that crystals
should be chosen carefully; compare, perhaps, Desiraju's 1998 fear of
drowning in a sea of structures!</p>

<P>
After crossing the Atlantic in the Queen Mary for a Fulbright year at
Pittsburgh in 1950-51, tasting the USA and liking it, Jeff accepted a
tenured faculty appointment there in 1953. Prompted by the brief Leeds
experience of the Ferranti Mark I electronic computer at Manchester, Jeff
soon organized a successful bid for an IBM 650 at Pitt., a sound basis for
his continued enthusiasm for digital crystallographic computing. Chemical
crystallography at Pitt. flourished (over 50 of Jeff's students are said to
be teaching in U.S. universities) on inorganic materials, then organic
compounds, especially conformation and hydrogen bonding in carbohydrates;
diffraction was later complemented by quantum mechanics (with J.A. Pople).
Jeff had long associations with the Pitt. Diffraction Conferences (only
illness prevented him chairing M. Sundaralingam's dinner at the 58th one
last October) and with the USA National Committee for Crystallography from
1955. </p>
 
<P>However, strong scientific links were maintained with Europe, at first by
making frequent use of U.S. Air Force transport. Jeff was appointed the RSC
Haworth Lecturer in 1998 (when the photograph at the top of this article
 was taken) and, happily, was
able to give his talk on hydrogen bonding in a Carbohydrate Symposium at
Birmingham, where it all started.</p>

Reviewers' comments on his 1994 monograph with W. Saenger "Hydrogen bonding
in biological structures" included 'scholarly and complete' and 'a real
treasure'; they could have been writing about Jeff himself.  <BR>

I am grateful for help from Bob Jones and Durward Cruickshank in writing
