<B><I>"A Piece in the Jigsaw: G6PD - The protein behind an hereditary disease"</I></B>

presented by Dr. Margaret Adams, Somerville College<br> 
and Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford<br>
 in the University Museum, Oxford at 5pm on  9 March 2004

Dr Margaret Adams was a research student of Dorothy Hodgkin and has
continued to work in the field of protein crystallography. She is the
Dorothy Hodgkin and E.P. Abraham Fellow of Somerville College and was the
supervisor of Dr Claire Naylor who gave last year's lecture. This lecture
was organised by the Oxford International Women's Festival with the support
of Oxford AWiSE and Somerville College. (The founding of this lecture 
series was described in 'Crystallography News' no. 85 June 2003 p18)</p>
<p>
Dr Adams began her talk by giving a brief overview of how x-ray
crystallography works. She described the work of Dorothy Hodgkin who was
awarded the Nobel Prize forty years ago this year. Dorothy established the
crystal structures of penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, among many
others, and Dr Adams showed illustrations of early diagrams and models of
these proteins. She described an incident where Dorothy had established the
three dimensional structure of a protein after studying it's diffraction
patterns for about an hour, when research students had been struggling over
them for days. She explained that advances in the technology and the storage
capability of computers now enabled those without Dorothy's insight to solve
structures in a fraction of the time that it had taken forty years ago.</p>

Dr Adams own research is concerned with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) which is an essential protein in the metabolic pathway,
involved in combating oxidative stress. People having a G6PD deficiency can
experience neo-natal jaundice and haemolytic anaemia, which is chronic for
some severe deficiencies, intolerance to fava beans (favism) or to drugs
such as aspirin and anti-malarials. The latter is a particular problem as
this deficiency is prevalent in areas where malaria is endemic, although the
deficiency does confer some protection against malaria. The deficiency is a
genetic disorder affecting 400 million people worldwide. The protein is
coded for on the X chromosome, and so men are far more likely to suffer from
the deficiency, although it has been found in some women unfortunate enough
to have an abnormality in both X chromosomes.</p>

Dr Adams showed how her studies of the crystal structure of G6PD had
revealed how small changes in the make-up of the protein can lead to changes
in it's three dimensional structure and stability and thus affect it's
efficiency of action. She concluded with some quotes from classical
literature about Pythagoras who had a profound fear of beans, which she
suggested may have been due to an awareness of favism so many centuries ago.
