Professor Louise Johnson FRS, David Phillips Professor of Molecular
Biophysics at Oxford University, gave the first Dorothy Hodgkin Memorial
Lecture at Oxford's Museum of Natural History on 4 March.  Entitled "Dorothy
Hodgkin and penicillin - 50 years from structure to present day
understanding of biosynthesis and bacterial resistance", the lecture was
organised by the Oxford International Women's Festival with the support of
Oxford AWiSE and Somerville College. <p>

Dorothy Hodgkin remains the only British woman scientist ever to have won a
Nobel prize.  She won it for her x-ray cyrstallographic studies of important
biological molecules, mainly penicillin and Vitamin B12, and went on to lead
the team that solved the structure of the hormone insulin.  Professor
Johnson never worked directly with her, but came to know her well when she
worked on similar problems in an adjacent laboratory at Oxford; like
Professor Hodgkin, she too became a Fellow of Somerville College.  For her
lecture she chose to focus on penicillin, to mark the 50th anniversary of
the first publication of its structure, and because modern structural
biology is still playing an important role in the fight against infectious
disease. <p>

She began by recalling Alexander Fleming's accidental discovery of the
penicillium mould's lethal effect on bacteria in 1929, and his failure to
capitalise on that discovery.  The story then switched to Oxford, where ten
years later Professor Howard Florey and Ernst Chain in the Sir William Dunn
School of Pathology were beginning to look at a variety of
naturally-produced chemicals that could kill bacteria.  Florey's assistant,
Norman Heatley solved the problem that had stumped Fleming, that of
extracting the penicillin from the mould, and they went on to conduct a
dramatic experiment.  Florey injected eight mice with lethal doses of
streptococci, and then dosed four of them with penicillin.  All the
untreated mice were dead withing 16 hours; those that received penicillin
survived for days to weeks.  Successful trials on human patients quickly
followed. <p>

Dorothy Hodgkin's role in the story was to solve the three-dimensional
stucture of the penicillin molecule at a time when its chemical formula was
still the subject of much debate.  It was the largest molecule ever to have
been solved by X-ray methods at the time.  The crucial part of the molecule
turned out to be the four-membered beta-lactam ring.  Professor Johnson
explained how this structure enables the drug to target bacteria very
specifically, while having no effect on human tissues.  It interferes with
the construction of bacterial cell walls, interacting with an unusual
'right-handed' form of amino acid, and so prevents the bacteria from
multiplying.<p>

Although at the time chemists hoped that Dorothy's solution of the penicillin structure would make it possible to produce the drug synthetically, in fact fermentation of the mould still plays an important part in penicillin production.  Professor Johnson explained that it was only in the past few years that researchers in the Dyson Perrins Laboratory at Oxford had solved the structure of the enzyme isopenicillin synthase and uncovered the complex sequence of steps by which the penicillium mould makes penicillin. <p>

She went on to bring the story right up to date, presenting the stark
realities of antibiotic resistance.  Because of over-use and failure to
complete the courses prescribed, penicillins and many other antibiotics have
now become virtually useless in many parts of the world as resistant strains
of bacteria have gained the upper hand.  She explained how researchers and
bacteria were now locked in an 'arms race' as each tried to overcome the
weapons of the other.  Many bacteria secrete an enzyme called
beta-lactamase, which disables the penicillin molecule before it can enter
the bacterial cell.  Using the latest versions of the x-ray techniques
applied with such skill by Dorothy Hodgkin, structural biologists have
discovered the structure of this enzyme and other proteins that play a role
in penicilin's interaction with bacteria, and are now exploring ways of
undermining bacterial defences so that antibiotics can do their work.  The
approach, said Professor Johnson, was like that of visitors to the
underworld in the ancient Greek legend, who had to throw a cake into the
jaws of the guard dog Cerberus to give them time to slip past. <p>

Professor Johnson left her own work to the end of the lecture.  She and her
colleagues have now turned their attention to the natural but uncontrolled
processes that turn normal cells into cancers.  Cancers are a much more
difficult target than bacteria, because of the risk that treatments will
also damage normal, healthy tissue.  The molecules she is investigating are
enzymes - protein kinases - that alter other proteins during the cell's
cycle of growth and reproduction.  Humans have up to 2000 different kinds of
these enzymes, and the challenge is to find drugs that can inhibit one or
more of them very specifically.  Using a series of computer-generated
images, Professor Johnson showed how once again, structural studies are
playing an important part in revealing the complex interplay of molecules in
health and disease.<p>

She concluded with a slide showing Dorothy Hodgkin beaming with
characteristic delight in front of a model of the enzyme lysozyme, the first
enzyme structure to be solved.  Professor Johnson had worked on this
structure as a young PhD student in the laboratory of Professor David
Phillips (who sadly died only a few days before the lecture).  As the
Principal of Somerville College Dame Fiona Caldecott said in her vote of
thanks, Professor Johnson's talk showed that she shared the same delight and
enthusiasm for her subject as Dorothy Hodgkin.<p>
