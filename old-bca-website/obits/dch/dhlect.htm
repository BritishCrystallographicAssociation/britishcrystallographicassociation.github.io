<H2>The Founding of the Dorothy Hodgkin Memorial lecture</h2>
<P>
This Memorial lecture now forms part of the Oxford International Festival
for Women held annually in March. In 1998 the Chair of the Festival, Anne
Mobbs, felt that the UK's only woman Nobel Laureate in Chemistry deserved
greater recognition, particularly in Oxford, where she did the work for
which she gained a Nobel prize in 1964. Anne discussed it with Dorothy's old
College, Somerville, the University Museum, where Dorothy had worked, and
the Oxford AWiSE, (Association for Women in Science and Engineering, whose
regular 'Oxford Science Lectures' began in December 1996; they thought  one
of the lectures in their Series could be designated as a 'Dorothy Hodgkin
Memorial Lecture'.  
</p>

<P>
A note about the launch of an appeal to fund a possible memorial for Dorothy
in Oxford was published in the March 1998 issue of 'Crystallography News' 
(page 17). The appeal was launched at a meeting held in the University
Museum on 19 March 1998 with the title 'An evening dedicated to the memory
and achievements of The Amazing Dorothy Hodgkin'.   I did not attend myself,
but I was told that Georgina Ferry, Dorothy's biographer, interviewed Judith
Howard, one of Dorothy's students, and encouraged her reminiscences about
Dorothy's life. The June 1998 issue of 'Crystallography News' carried an
Appeal flyer printed by the Oxford International Women's Week Collective,
which gave a brief history of Dorothy's life of Science in Oxford and
appealed for donations for 2 possible projects, to commission a statue of
Dorothy to be placed in the University Museum of Natural History and to
finance childcare bursaries for Oxford women students. 

<P>
Members of the BCA were asked to make donations and suggest a suitable
memorial. All the comments I received thought that Dorothy would have hated
a statue of herself, and the Childcare bursaries were a much better idea.
Does anyone know whether the Chidcare Bursaries were ever funded?

This lecture is now sponsored jointly by the Oxford International Festival
for Women, AWiSE (Association of Women in Science and Engineering),
Somerville College who select the speaker and finance a reception afterwards
and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History who donate the lecture
room and reception facilities in the Museum.
