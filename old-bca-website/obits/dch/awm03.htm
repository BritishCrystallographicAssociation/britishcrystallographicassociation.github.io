Claire Naylor was a student at Somerville, gaining a 1st class degree in
Chemistry in 1993 and a D.Phil in Crystallography in 1996.  She is now a
Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellow in the Protein Toxins Structure Group
at Birkbeck College. She started by explaining that as all the previous
lecturers in this series had been Dorothy's students, she felt more like one
of Dorothy's grandchildren since her supervisor had been one of Dorothy's
students.

Her current research is on pathogenic proteins, particularly those secreted
by bacteria, 99.9% of which are completely harmless to humans, and survive
for years intheir environemt, but others are toxic, for example, the
streptococcus which causes sore throats, in other forms is  the MRSA 'Super
bug' resistant to most antibiotics. Her current interest is in lethal
bacterial toxins including the <I>Clostridium perfringens</I> alpha-toxin,
and others associated with this one. This protein is widely distributed
being found in human and animal gut and in the soil. One toxin is an entero
toxin, a common cause of food poisoning which causes vomiting and diarrhea,
but lasts only 48 hours in healthy adults and is rarely toxic. Epsilon toxin
causes a nervous disorder in sheep, with a swelling of the brain which
proves fatal in 48 hours. Beta toxin  is common amongst people who have been
existing on a meagre diet and then have a huge meal of more nourishing food.
It forms a type of gangrene in the intestines. It was first detected in the
victims from concentration camps, but now there is a vaccination against it.

The alpha toxin is associated with the disease 'gas-gangrene' which has been
known for a long time. Graphic illustrations were shown of the unpleasant
symptoms of gas gangrene. King Richard I is thought to have died from it,
when his wound from a crossbow became infected. It has caused sudden death
in Belgian bee colonies, 100,000 soldiers died from it during World War I
and it caused an epidemic following a tidal wave in 1998 in Papua New
Guinea. It is the first major toxin to be shown to be an enzyme, but the
exact mechanism of how it destroys other cells is not known. It thrives in
wounds where the supply of oxygen is limited. The only known cure is
amputation of the affected limb.

Their research group is using several techniques to study the effects of the
toxin on mammalian cells taken from the heart and lungs of cows. The alpha
toxins surround healthy cells and destroy the protective cell surface
membranes. These are made of phosphor lipid bilayers which are attacked by
the toxin; it 'slices' off the hydrophilic head groups, leaving the
hydrophobic tails within the cell, where they may trigger inflammation and
release of calcium ions, which are used in signal transmission with
neighbouring cells. The toxin has been crystallised and its structure found
so that the conformation of the 'active site' which causes the damage can be
studied in the hope of eventually developing a less drastic treatment than
amputation for wounds infected with 'gas gangrene'.  An additional problem
is that these alpha toxins suppress the immune response but it is not known
how they do this, so further studies are needed.

Margaret Adams thanked the lecturer for giving us this fascinating and 
well illustrated lecture despite suffering from a sore throat. 
We then adjourned for a reception in the mainhall of the University 
Museum with its Victorian architecture and dinosaur skeletons.
