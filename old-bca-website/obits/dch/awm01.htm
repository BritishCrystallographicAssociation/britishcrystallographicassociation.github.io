<CENTER>
<H3>University Museum, Oxford, 15th May 2001</H3></CENTER>(Given in conjunction 
with the unveiling by the Royal Society of Chemistry of the second National 
Historical Chemical Landmark. This recognises the distinguished role of 
Professor Hodgkin's laboratory in the development of methods for solving crystal 
structures, which are the basis of modern molecular biology and medicinal 
chemistry. The site for the plaque, at the entrance to the Oxford University 
Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, was chosen for its proximity to the office where 
Professor Hodgkin worked from 1956 to 1972.)
<P>Professor Jenny Glusker of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia 
U.S.A., an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, took as her theme for the 3rd 
Dorothy Hodgkin memorial lecture "Vitamin B12 and Dorothy: their impact on 
structural science" and demonstrated the extraordinary pioneering achievements 
of a scientist and mentor who still found time to raise a family, welcome 
visitors to her home and give every encouragement to her students. 
<P>Born in Cairo in 1910 to a father who was Director of Education in the Sudan 
and a mother interested in archaeology and textiles, Dorothy Crowfoot returned 
to England with her two younger sisters on the outbreak of the First World War. 
Professor Glusker explained that she was brought up by her grandparents and 
formed life-long political ideas through joining the Girl Guides and meeting 
poor people. Gaining a First in Chemistry at Somerville College in 1931, at the 
time highly unusual for a woman, Dorothy began her career in X-ray 
Crystallography - studying organometallic compounds as a Part II student under 
H.D. Powell, and then assisting J.D. Bernal in Cambridge to investigate the 
structure of sterols. Though not determining actual atomic positions, she was 
able to show by the size of the structural repeat and the direction of greatest 
refractive index that the accepted chemical formula of these compounds was wrong 
and they contained a 5-, not a 6-, membered ring. 
<P>In her Nobel Prize lecture in December 1964 on "X-ray analysis of complicated 
molecules", Dorothy described her subsequent research as resulting from "a 
series of lucky accidents". Awarded a fellowship from Somerville College to 
continue study of cholesterol iodide, she helped Bernal obtain the first 
diffraction pattern from a crystal of a biological material - the digestive 
enzyme pepsin. It was soon after these photographs were reported that she was 
offered crystals of insulin, the protein whose atomic structure would become her 
life's work and she did not declare "solved" until August 1969. World War II 
meanwhile saw another elegant proof from her, this time using a map of electron 
density she had drawn on transparent sheets, that atoms of penicillin were not 
arranged as many chemists thought to form two separate 5-membered rings, but a 
single 5-membered ring was fused to a 4-membered (beta- lactam) ring.
<P>Jenny Glusker admitted she became a student of Dorothy in Oxford thinking 
that she could use infra-red spectroscopy to look at planar atomic groups in 
another biological molecule, vitamin B12 - but instead joined in the project to 
solve its structure by X-rays. It had been known from the mid 1920s that eating 
1/2lb of liver a day was beneficial to patients suffering from the potentially 
fatal symptoms of pernicious anaemia. Identified as the effective factor, 
vitamin B12 was known to contain a cobalt atom, a ring system and a large 
porphyrin-like group. She described how nowadays the X-ray crystallographer and 
the computer substitute for a lens to "see" how atoms are arranged. As a student 
in the 1950s, she had to measure the intensities of some 3500 diffraction spots 
on each film by eye and then spend 6 weeks calculating the terms for an electron 
density map using an "adding machine", a task much speeded up with the arrival 
of the first supercomputers. She recalled Dorothy's enthusiasm for this new 
technology, though she was concerned about errors in typing in the data and 
anxious that nothing was published before it was thoroughly checked. Dorothy was 
extremely excited however when the formula emerged for the red crystals Jenny 
had investigated. The structure of the hexacarboxylic acid, a degradation 
product of the vitamin, confirmed the surprising conclusion that here was a 
cyano-metallic compound with biological significance.
<P>Understanding how vitamin B12 acts, and its influence on metabolic cycles, is 
still the objective of studies today. The unexpected discovery of a cleavable 
cobalt-carbon bond has led to extensive research into free radical reactions. 
Professor Glusker said it was a pity that a paper by researchers at the 
University of Michigan in 1994, the first to describe the binding of B12 to a 
protein - methionine synthase, was published just too late to tell Dorothy that 
the cobalt atom may form a catalytic quartet with neighbouring histidine, 
asparagine and serine residues. In establishing the structure of the vitamin, 
Dorothy had shown skill, imagination and audacity in trying methods others had 
dismissed. She had investigated several variant and related forms of the 
vitamin, exploited anomalous effects in the scattering of X-rays by atoms, and 
insisted on using full three-dimensional data rather than draw conclusions, as 
others did, from projections. Having attached so much importance to obtaining a 
correct structure, she set standards and this work was described by fellow Nobel 
Laureate W.L. Bragg as having "broken the sound barrier".
<P>Recalling 40 years of friendship, Max Perutz - another crystallographic Nobel 
Laureate - wrote that "some women intellectuals regard their children as 
distracting impediments to their careers, but Dorothy radiated motherly warmth 
even while engaged in writing crystallographic papers. Concentration comes to 
her so easily that she can give all her attention to a child's chatter at one 
moment and switch to lattice transformations the next without any sign of 
strain". Despite arthritis and the distractions of family, students and other 
projects, Dorothy's passion for science kept her active and productive in 
research throughout her life. She was widely praised her unerring instinct for 
problems and her belief in the power of X-ray crystallography was handsomely 
vindicated.
