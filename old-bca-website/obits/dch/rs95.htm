<strong>Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships</strong><br>
 - A New Initiative for young scientists<p>

    The Royal Society is piloting a new postdoctoral fellowship scheme, to
be known as the Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships. The idea for the scheme arose
from the Society's own investigation in 1994 into the current situation for
women scientists, and was consolidated by the findings of 'The Rising Tide'
a report produced for the Office of Science and Technology (OST). Both the
Society and the OST concluded that the first few years after a PhD, when
young persons aged between 25 and 35 are establishing themselves in
scientific careers, is also the time when a) the individual may be starting
a family b)the "system" offers very little in the way of security and
flexibility at work.<p>

      Clearly the conflict of pressure from home and work will impact on
both parents, but as women tend to take on the main responsibilities of
child-rearing they are normally the ones most severely affected. Statistics
show that the stage between PhD and Lecturer is one during which a
significant number of women find themselves either progressing rather more
slowly than their male colleagues, or deciding to abandon their research
careers altogether. The Society is therefore piloting this new scheme  to
offer a recognised first step into a research career for excellent young
scientists and engineers. The fellowships are open to both sexes and will
offer a high level of support and flexibility which is advantageous to both,
but should be particularly useful and encouraging to women. The Society
stresses that awards will be made on merit. <p>

     Ten fellowships will be available offering four years' guaranteed
tenure on research Staff IA/II scale, up to  £5000 annual grant to cover
research expenses, the option of participating in mentor and networking
schemes, the option of working part time, regular career advice,
support and flexibility with maternity cover.<p>

      Applicants should preferably not have passed their 35th birthday by  1
October 1995 and should have Ph.D or equivalent research experience. They
should have had no more than three years' research experience at
post-doctoral level on taking up the fellowship and should be normally
resident in the UK. <p>
 
    The Royal Society enrolled the help of universities, as prospective
employers of the Dorothy Hodgkin Fellows, by asking them to advertise the
scheme internally. Two different forms of advertisement were used, one for
those departments where women are significantly under-represented, the other
for all other departments.<p> 

     Although named after Dorothy Hodgkin, the fellowships are not limited
to crystallographic applicants, they cover all areas of natural sciences.
They will be funded by a mixture of the Society's own private funds and its
Parliamentary Grant-in-aid.<p> 
 
      The closing date for these fellowships was 19 May 1995, so by the time
you read this it will be too late to apply, but I thought members would like
to learn of this initiative. Those of you who have been regularly looking at 
BCA news on our World Wide Web homepage  will have seen
this news in time to apply.<p> 

     We hope to bring you a report on the winners of the first set of
fellowships in a future issue of 'Crystallography News'.<p>
