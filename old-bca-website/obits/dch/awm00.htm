The second Dorothy Hodgkin Memorial Lecture was delivered on Monday 13th March,
2000, in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History by Professor Judith
Howard, who was herself a D.Phil student of Dorothy Hodgkin.  She took as her
theme the ways in which X-ray crystallography has been able to reveal a
fundamental understanding of molecules and the forces which bind them together,
and increasingly so whenever it has been possible to raise the resolution of
the observation.  Not infrequently, data which are thought to have been
correctly interpreted prove to have a much more complex structure when
investigated in more detail.  The lecture discussed many of the improvements in
techniques which now enable X-ray crystallographers to derive information that
is of great value to both chemists and biochemists.<p>
 
Professor Howard first described the basic principles of X-ray crstallography.
When X-rays are passed through a crystal, diffraction patterns are produced;
each diffraction pattern is unique to the specific arrangements of the atoms
within a molecule, so examination of diffraction patterns enables the
investigator to deduce the molecular structure of the material, and to study
the forces which bind the particles together.  Not knowing the properties in
advance, one has to work empirically by proposing models and comparing them
with the observations.  The models will of course depend on the state of
relevant knowledge at the time; for example, researchers in the
nineteenth century assumed that a molecule must have a two-dimensional
structure, and it was not until the 1930's that models for three-dimensional structure
could be considered seriously, although Dorothy Hodgkin had in fact visualized 3-D
solutions in her BSc thesis in 1932.  Most molecular structures were then
largely unknown, and to extract them from the diffraction patterns that the
investigators were learning how to make involved an enormous labour of
calculations by hand.  The dynamic behaviour of molecular structure was also
not appreciated for a long time.  Today we use computer graphics to give full
3-dimensional structures and to identify the details of molecular interaction.<p>
 
Dorothy Hodgkin began her X-ray crystallography work during an undergraduate
project to determine the three-dimensional structure of thallium dialkyl
halides.  She was obviously very inspired by the subject, and went on to study
increasingly complicated molecules with what was then a new technique of X-ray
crystallography.  Dorothy not only had the kind of patience and persistence
that the hand-calculated modelling demanded, but was also blessed with gifts of
pattern recognition and inspiration.  It was said that she could spot the
essentials of a molecule's structure just from a single X-ray diffraction
pattern, even though such a pattern is only one section through a
three-dimentional structure.  Most researchers need the full set of pictures in
order to visualize the structure - or to have a graphics package draw it out for
them.<p>
 
One of the molecules Dorothy Hodgkin worked on during her early career was
cholesteryl iodide.  There were two current models for its structure, and both
were consistent with the chemical observations available to date.  However Dorothy
was able to perform calculations that confirmed which of the models was the
correct one.  She then went on to study the complex molecule penicillin: it was
war-time, and there was an urgent need to understand the structure of this
powerful antibiotic so that chemists could synthesize it in large quantities.
The structure was eventually published by Dorothy and her colleagues in 1949
(though with the wrong chirality - at the time the X-ray techniques were unable to
resolve the left-right ambiguity).  In the late 1940's she began her studies on vitamin B12 - the
work which was to gain her the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964.  Vitamin B12 had a much more
complex structure than any other previously resolved, though certain of its
chemical properties aided the investigations (it contained a heavy atom,
cobalt, which showed up well in X-ray diffraction patterns).  However, Dorothy
Hodgkin's principal achivement was to understand the structure of insulin.  She
began work on this vital substance in 1934, taking the first X-ray photographs 
of the crystals, although it was not until 1969 that
her group was able to publish the basic structure, and she continued to work on
higher-resolution details of that structure until the late 1980s.<p>
 
As X-ray crystallography techniques have steadily sharpened there have been
many gradual improvements in the quality of the results, while fresh
discoveries have also given rise to important developments in the techniques
themselves.  It was suspected, for instance, that much clearer diffraction
patterns could be obtained at low temperatures when the blurring due to the
natural movements of the atoms would be significantly reduced, but it was
generally feared that below about 4 C the water in the crystal would freeze and
thus destroy the crystalline structure.  However, it was discovered that
protein crystals do still preserve their molecular structure if cooled very
quickly to low temperatures - a technique developed in Oxford, and now applied
routinely worldwide.  This was as significant as the discovery in the 1930's that
X-ray diffraction patterns could be obtained for some biological crystals if
they were maintained 'wet' in their mother liquors and not allowed to dry out.  
The resulting improvements in the resolution of all molecular
structures has, for example, enabled chemists to investigate in much finer
detail the bonding forces and weak links within and between molecules.<p>
 
The improvements which the chemists have been able to achieve in understanding
molecular structures and interactions have fed over into other sciences.  In
industrial chemistry, for instance, a knowledge of the molecular structure of
natural crystalline products such as silk is at the heart of the artificial
fibre and polythene industries; the wide spectrum of different properties
induced by the inclusion of different metal atoms into a molecular structure
promises an almost infinite variety of synthetic materials.  Equally, at the 
interface with biology the development of molecular biosensors, which employ different
molecules to identify the presence of small amounts of trace elements, depend
critically upon a detailed knowledge of the molecular structures in question,
while a knowledge of the trace elements is fundamental to understanding the
physical properties of that substance.<p>

Professor Howard's group in Durham is currently investigating the effects which
low temperatures (25 - 300 K) and different pressure have upon the attainable
resolution of X-ray diffraction patterns.  When crystals are cooled to the
lower of those limits the inter-molecular spaces and interatomic regions can then be
studied.  The ability to look in between molecules, as well as at their structural detail, has led to
an increased understanding of the weak interactions that exist between the
molecules in the crystal.  The completed structures with which she illustrated
these developments were as beautiful as they were complicated, each showing a
different intricate maze of three-dimensional patterns.<p>

World-wide developments in X-ray crystallography owe a great deal to Dorothy
Hodgkin's demonstrations of how molecular structures could be solved with a
slide-rule and a certain amount of vision, even though it took days or months
to acquire the data.  Today, diffraction patterns of considerably greater
resolution can be obtained in a matter of hours and synthesized digitally in a
matter of minutes.  The potential of still higher resolution that might be
obtained at temperatures below 10 K is extremely attractive, but remains
elusive at present because single crystal diffraction data is technically difficult to
obtain at such very low temperatures.
The Durham group, in particular, is planning to develop a technique for
reducing the temperature below 10 K in order to realize that potential.
Who can foretell what applications - in chemistry, biophysics, surgery,
architecture, art, telecommunications or space travel - may result when the
innermost structure of everyday materials and compounds is understood to the
full?<p>

In thanking Professor Howard for a stimulating lecture, Elizabeth Griffin
(Oxford AWiSE) remarked on the huge advances in technology since Dorothy
Hodgkin's first work in X-ray crystallography: technological advances allow
higher-resolution data to be collected quickly, and computational power enables
data to be interpreted very rapidly.  But she also cautioned that tools are
only as good as those who use them, and that what Dorothy Hodgkin was able to
achieve with the basic technology available to her at the time was due to her
intelligence and hard work - skills which are just as vital today.<p>
