<h1>Peter Salt     1935 - 1996</h1>

  Peter Salt died on 7 October 1996 following a short illness. He was 61.
Peter's scientific career began at the Rothampstead Experimental Station
where he was occupied with a soil survey of England and Wales and worked
with George Brown of clay minerals fame. Later, Peter moved to ICI where he
met Sylvia, his future wife. In 1968 he joined the R&D department of English
China Clays (then known as ECLP) where initially he worked on the development
of their new XRF facilities. Peter soon became involved in XRD as well, and
eventually took responsibility for the whole analytical section. <p> 

Peter's
early work at ECC included the automation of  XRD analyses and  the
development of  methods for the quantitative analysis of clays and accessory
minerals. His role as laboratory Health and Safety Officer led to a broader 
interest in matters of Occupational Health concern and specifically the use
of analytical methods for the accurate determination of controlled
substances. The issues and legislation surrounding
crystalline silica are of real importance to many extractive
industries, and the determination of crystalline silica became
a particular expertise. Peter developed XRD methods of on-
filter dust analysis at ECC and when the HSE began formulating
their Methods for the Determination of Hazardous Substances for
quartz and cristobalite in airborne dusts, Peter was consulted
and made significant contributions to the development of the
approved methods. <p>

An announcement in  1987 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC)  that crystalline silica was a probable human carcinogen caused near
panic in many US chemical /mineral producers, who were concerned about the
possible effect on  business. Reviews commissioned by the Chemical
Manufacturers Association suggested that accurate measurement at the 0.1
wt.% level would be exceedingly difficult. Peter showed that by careful
experimentation accurate quantitation of quartz  in clays and other
industrial minerals  at the 0.1 wt.% level was certainly possible by XRD.
Latterly, Peter became concerned with errors in quantitative XRD, and
particularly the role of particle statistics in the determination of low
levels of analyte. The results of this, and other work was presented widely
at conferences both in the UK and abroad, and in journal publications. His
final work on particle statistics was published in Pow. Diffr. just a few
weeks before he died. <p> 
 Peter was
well known and highly regarded in the industrial powder diffraction
community. His manner was quiet and unassuming, he gave his time freely, and 
was always ready to offer help and advice. It was a pleasure and privilege
to work with him. Peter took early retirement in 1994 and was honoured and
proud to receive the <a href="../ig/oldrep.html#award95">BCA-IG award</a>
 in 1995. The award came as a complete
surprise, and the presentation at  the IG autumn meeting was Peter's last
`public engagement'. Peter was admitted to hospital at the beginning of
October following two mild heart attacks, but went on to develop a lung
infection from which he never recovered. We extend our condolences to
Sylvia, and to their daughter, Margaret and son, Jonathan. He will be
greatly missed. <p>
