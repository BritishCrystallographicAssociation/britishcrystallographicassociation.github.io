</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">I am a little sorry
now that when I learned that Newsletter editors were seeking someone
to write a notice about Anne for the ACA Newsletter, in my love
for her I volunteered. I feel that it would have been fairer to
her if what she was had been said by someone not so close to her.
But having agreed to do it, here I go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">Anne was not a scientist.
In 1943, having gone to Radcliffe College and gotten a degree
in government, she joined the Radiation Laboratory at M.I.T. to
do her bit for the war effort; her job had to do with ordering
special-design transformers for the lab. She never really came
to know what a transformer was, and within a few months, feeling
that her efforts were really helping our opponents more than ourselves,
she left the lab for a job she could handle. She was there long
enough, however, for us to meet, and shortly after the war we
married.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">But if not a scientist herself,
she cared for scientists and in an important sense understood
their work; married to a scientist, she often said that she was
a camp-follower to the scientists. And she was articulate. From
about the mid-40s to the mid-70s, she was a successful writer,
mainly of short stories, of which several found their way into
the Foley's and the Best American Short Stories collections. When
in 1949 we went to England so that I could study crystallography
under Dorothy Hodgkin, she helped keep us financially afloat with
her sales of stories, and with her job as an editor at the Oxford
University Press. It happened too, in 1949, that she met Rosalind
Franklin, and they became fast friends. We saw Rosalind fairly
frequently through the next two years, while we were in Oxford
and she in London, this period covering most of the period of
Rosalind's work on DNA, though not the final months, as we came
home to the U.S. in Sept 1951, a few months prior to the solving
of the DNA structure. In the next few years she visited us several
times in the U.S., and I think it was in 1957 that Anne helped
to nurse her in England following her unsuccessful operation for
cancer. Rosalind died in 1958.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">Time passed again. In 1962
Crick, Watson, and Wilkins received the Nobel prize for the DNA
structure, and in 1968 Watson published &quot;The Double Helix&quot;.
That book, although interesting and good reading, was felt by
most crystallographers to be unfair to Rosalind and to undermine
the spirit of friendship and cooperation in which crystallography
had traditionally been done. In 1969, at the Eighth International
Congress, which was held that year at SUNY Stony Brook, just a
few miles from where we then lived, a number of crystallographers
suggested that Anne should write a book in answer to Watson's.
Anne said &quot;It's your science, why don't you write it?&quot;,
but in the end agreed that she would do so. The rest I think most
people know. She worked 5 years on &quot;Rosalind Franklin and
DNA&quot; (and incidentally received much help on it from Francis
Crick), and it was published in 1975. I think the situation today
is truer and better for the book having been written. The book
is still in print, and seems to win about a thousand new readers
each year, mainly in the colleges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">Following that effort, Anne
treated herself to a long-standing wish and, at the age of 52,
went to law school, getting her degree quite high in her class
at NYU Law School. She did pro bono law work for a time, and then,
learning of the body of environmental law then being created by
the New York State legislature, devoted much of her later years
to beneficial application of that law locally in the beautiful
coastal area in Long Island in which we lived. Still later she
became the much-loved justice of our local court, a position which
she filled until about a year and a half before her death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">She was an excellent public
speaker, and the talks which she gave from time to time about
Rosalind, as at the 1983 ACA Lexington Ky. meeting, or about Dorothy
Hodgkin at the tribute to Dorothy and Pauling given at the 1995
ACA Montreal meeting, I believe are still remembered. She loved
crystallography and crystallographers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times">She died on March 13, 1998
in Somerville NJ of pneumonia and the complications of scleroderma,
the disease against which she fought for the last decade of her
life.<BR>
