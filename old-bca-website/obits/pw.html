<h1>Peter Wheatley, 1921-1997</h1>
<p>
Peter Jaffrey Wheatley, who died  on 12 May 1997, had an influential and
varied career in physical chemistry, crystallography and structural
chemistry. His publications (more than 100 papers and 5 books), his
editorial work for Acta Crystallographica, his teaching, and his classic
text Molecular Structure, first published in 1959 and translated into 15
languages, make him a key figure in the development of crystallography from
the 1950's.
<p>
Peter was nearly a Yorkshireman, born in Cheshire but moving counties as an
infant!  He was educated in Sheffield before going to Oxford around the
start of the war.  He had scarcely begun his degree course when, as
Bombardier Wheatley, he was sent to the Far Eastern theatre, was captured
during the fall of Singapore and survived four terrible years as a prisoner
of war.  After recovering his health, he returned to Oxford, gained a first
in Chemistry in two years, a DPhil in Physical Chemistry within a further
two years, and was married to Jo (also from Sheffield). His Thesis had
sections on  (a) flame propagation and (b) molecular structure, and his
second research year was carried out as a Commonwealth Fellow at the
University of Minnesota. His distinguished crystallographic career developed
at the University of Leeds, where he moved in 1951 and where he wrote the
first drafts of Molecular Structure.  In 1957, Peter and Jo, now blessed
with three daughters, moved to Switzerland, where he worked for nine years
in the Laboratories of Monsanto Research S.A. in Zurich.

Following a year as Visiting Professor in Tucson, Arizona, Peter returned to
academic life in the UK in 1967, to the Department of Physical Chemistry at
Cambridge.  Here he ran an active research group, the graduates of which now
hold positions all over the world, became a Fellow of Queens' College, and
was renowned at both Departmental and College level for his teaching and
lecturing.  He also served as British Co-Editor of 
<em>Acta Crystallographica</em>
for 12 years in the 1970's and 80's, processing a phenomenal number of
papers with care, knowledge and not a little tact!  Peter was very active in
College life being, at various times, Junior Bursar, Senior Bursar and
Director of Studies in Natural Sciences at Queens'.  He was made a Life
Fellow when he retired in 1988.  On his retirement Peter joined the
Crystallographic Data Centre part-time as the Senior Database Editor who
'sorted out'  the more complex problems that arose during the CCDC's
checking process, leaving only a couple of years ago due to failing health.
His contribution at the CCDC was immense, due to his infectious enthusiasm
and deep knowledge of his subject.
<p>
As a person, Peter was both a very private man, who delighted in his family
and the progress of his grandchildren, and also an engaging and humorous
companion with an endless capacity to surprise.   He always detected and
laughed at the absurdities of life, and debunked anything pompous or
pretentious.  He had a life long interest in many sports and played cricket
enthusiastically (and extremely capably - as this bowler rapidly came to
know!) well into his 50's.  Peter was a wonderful colleague and friend and
many areas of life are the poorer for his passing.
