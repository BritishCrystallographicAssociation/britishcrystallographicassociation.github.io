<h1>Sir John Kendrew</h1>
<p>
In October 1945 a young man in a smart Wing Commander's uniform walked into
my room at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and said that he wanted to
become my research student.  He introduced himself as John Kendrew.  I was
flattered because I had never had a research student, let alone one hardly
my junior who had distinguished himself in the war, but I also felt
embarrassed, because my work on the structure of haemoglobin promised no
quick solution on which anyone could earn a Ph.D.  Walking across to the
Molteno Institute, I ran into Joseph Barcroft, the great respiratory
physiologist, who suggested that Kendrew might make a comparative study of
adult and foetal sheep haemoglobin for which Barcroft would supply the
blood.  Much relieved, I suggested this to Kendrew who keenly took up the
project.
<p>
To-day's readers can hardly imagine how courageous Kendrew's decision was
then to take up protein crystallography.  I had no research students,
because responsible dons advised graduates against joining such a forlorn
undertaking, but Kendrew's spirit of adventure won.  He was born in Oxford
in 1917, educated there at the Dragon School and then at Clifton College
where an outstanding chemistry teacher inspired him.  In 1936 he entered
Trinity College, Cambridge, with a major scholarship; in 1939 he graduated
in Chemistry and then began working for a Ph.D. in physical chemistry.  The
war diverted him to radar and later to operational research; he ended it as
advisor to Lord Mountbatten's South Eastern Command in Ceylon.
<p>
In 1947, soon after Kendrew joined me, the MRC agreed to make us into a
Research Unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological
Systems, later to be renamed MRC Unit for Molecular Biology.  When the
present Laboratory of Molecular Biology opened in 1962, Kendrew became its
deputy director, a post he held until 1974.
<p>
I found in Kendrew an outstandingly able, resourceful, meticulous,
brilliantly organised, knowledgeable, hard worker and a stimulating,
companion with wide interests in science, literature, music and the arts. 
Having carried sheep haemoglobin as far as was possible at the time, he
embarked on his own project, the structure of myoglobin which has only a
quarter of the molecular weight of haemoglobin and therefore seemed a more
hopeful candidate for X-ray study.  After a long struggle with myoglobin
from horse heart which refused to yield crystals large enough for X-ray
analysis, Kendrew realised that diving mammals and birds offered a better
prospect, because nearly one tenth of the dry weight of their muscles
consists of myoglobin which they use as an oxygen store.  A chance encounter
enabled me to get him a large chunk of sperm whale meat from Peru, and to
our delight its myoglobin yielded large sapphire-like crystals which gave
beautiful X-ray diffraction diagrams.  However, there was still a seemingly
insuperable obstacle.
<p>
The X-ray diffraction pattern from a crystal contains only half the
information needed to solve its structure: the amplitudes of the diffracted
rays, but not their phases, and there seemed to be no way of determining
these.  Fortunately, I discovered in 1953 that the phase problem could be
solved by comparing the diffraction pattern from two crystals, one of the
native protein and the other of the protein with heavy atoms attached to it. 
Kendrew, together with several able young men from the United States, Sweden
and Austria found ways of attaching heavy atoms to myoglobin in several
positions.  By 1957 they obtained an electron density map at 6Å resolution
which allowed Kendrew to build a rough molecular model, and two years later
they extended the resolution to 2.0Å, allowing him to build an atomic model,
the first of any protein.

 For this work, for the introduction of the heavy
atom method and for the solution of the haemoglobin structure at 5.5Å, we
were awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1962.
<p>
That year also marked the end of Kendrew's scientific research.  Realising
perhaps that his talents lay more in organisation and diplomacy, he reverted
first to his war-time interests by becoming part-time deputy to Solly
Zuckerman, then Chief Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence.  Later,
Kendrew's prime interest shifted to international scientific collaboration. 
He spoke fluent German, French and Italian and was a devoted European.  As
chairman of international committees, he was skilled at guiding members to a
consensus and putting it into the right words.  Kendrew was deeply concerned
that European universities and research institutes were slow in grasping the
promise of molecular biology, and that Europe was falling behind the United
States in training young people in the subject.
<p>
In 1963, he therefore became one of the founders of EMBO, the
<strong>European Molecular Biology Organisation </strong>which started the
programme of travelling fellowships and summer schools that has been such an
outstanding success.  He also founded and remained for many years
editor-in-chief of the <strong>Journal of Molecular Biology</strong>.  He took great pride in
it, and it became the journal where nearly all important papers in the
subject used to appear.  In 1974, after four years of patient and skilful
diplomacy, he finally persuaded governments to build a <strong>European Laboratory
of Molecular Biology</strong> in Heidelberg and became its first director.  This
great laboratory stands as his monument. 
<p>
After his retirement from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Kendrew
became President of St. John's College, Oxford, a post he held from
1981-1987.  From 1974-79 he was a Trustee of the British Museum and from
1974 to 1988 he was successively Secretary General, Vice-President and
President of the International Council of Scientific Unions.  Kendrew's
entry in Who's Who lists ten other important National and International
committees on which he served as either member or chairman.

Kendrew died in Cambridge on 23rd August aged 80.
