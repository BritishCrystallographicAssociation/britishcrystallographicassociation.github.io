<h1>SIR GORDON COX </h1>
       <strong> Sir Ernest Gordon Cox, KBE, TD, FRS</strong> died on 23 June
1996 at the age of 90. His career as a practising crystallographer lasted
from 1927, when he joined Sir William Bragg's group at the Royal
Institution, to 1960, when he left the University of Leeds to become
Secretary of the Agricultural Research Council.<p> 
        A native of Somerset, born in Bath on 24 April 1906, he graduated in
physics at Bristol University. At the Royal Institution he apprenticed
himself initially to W.T.Astbury, and made his first X-ray measurements on
aluminium acetylacetone. Sir William Bragg suggested as his main task the
crystalline structure of benzene. Even at 0°C the vapour pressure of benzene
is very high. A special rotation camera, with a double-walled cylinder
through which the cooling liquid was circulated, was constructed by
C.J.Jenkinson the laboratory mechanic at the Royal Institution. X-ray
measurements were made at -22°C. Cox was able to show that the space group
was Pbca and that the evidence strongly favoured a flat-ring molecule with
C-C about 1.42Å.<p> 
        In 1929 he was recruited by W.N.Haworth, the carbohydrate chemist,
to the staff of the Chemistry Department at Birmingham University. Here he
did pioneer work on the structures of sugars and of coordination compounds.
The latter included the finding of planar configurations for quadricovalent
compounds of nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver and gold. A
highlight was the determination of the crystal structure of vitamin C,
ascorbic acid, where his X-ray work was done in concert with the chemists.
(Haworth received the Nobel Prize in 1937 for his investigations on
carbohydrates and vitamin C.) Cox became increasingly interested in the
determination of accurate structures from three-dimensional data.
Pentaerythfitol (1937) was followed by glucosamine hydrobromide (1939). The
latter structure in P21 was solved by Patterson syntheses and by comparison
of corresponding F-values for the bromide and isomorphous chloride. The
details of the configuration around the pyranose ring were found from
three-dimensional Fourier syntheses calculated with Beevers-Lipson strips by
the labour of his research student George Jeffrey.<p> 
        Cox joined the Territorial Army in 1936, but for the early war years
remained at Birmingham to work on explosives. In 1942 he headed a laboratory
for the Special Operations Executive, and in 1944-45 as a Lieutenant-Colonel
was on special duties following the Allied advances in Europe. <p>
        In 1945 he was appointed as one of the Professors of Chemistry at
Leeds. There he built up a very happy Department of Inorganic and Structural
Chemistry. As his right-hand man in crystallography he recruited George
Jeffrey, who had continued crystallographic work throughout the war at the
British Rubber Producers' Research Association. Based on his Birmingham
experience, Cox was keenly aware that good results in chemical
crystallography were dependent on developments in apparatus and computing.
In the first years in Leeds, he took a particular interest in the design and
production of a Weissenberg camera and in the use of Hollerith punched-card
equipment. He was very quickly aware of the potentialities of electronic
computers, and despatched one of his team to the first programming school at
Cambridge in 1950, and thereafter to exploit the Ferranti Mark I machine in
Manchester from 1952 onwards.<p> 
 
        Cox assembled a strong all-round group in chemical crystallography.
In 1948 Norman Hartshorne came as Reader in Chemical Microscopy. By the time
Jeffrey left for Pittsburgh in 1953, younger staff members were ready to
fulfil his role. Besides several chemists - Mary Truter, Peter Wheatley,
John Smith and John Robertson - Cox also appointed a physicist - Geoffrey
Pringle - and a mathematician. John Smith, one of Rex Richard's first NMR
students in Oxford, completed the benzene story by working in a
low-temperature room. But Cox's early effort to obtain a grant for NMR work
was thwarted by a DSIR«The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,
DSIR, was the name of the Government body which then funded pure research.
The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, has a similar
function today.» committee who doubted that the magnetic properties of
nuclei would be useful in chemistry!<p> 
        It would be invidious to pick out individuals from the 40 or more
research students and postdocs who did crystallography at Leeds. Many have
attained distinction in their own right, while conversely visitors -
E.W.Hughes, G.B.Carpenter, R.W.James and P.P.Ewald among them - brought
great stimulation. All became members of the Pippin Club, the affectionate
name for the social gatherings of Cox's team. A stream of high grade
structure determinations flowed from his team, often setting standards for
others to follow. Many analyses concerned relatively simple molecules with
the object of establishing reliable values for various standard bonds (e.g.
C-S, C=S, etc.), or of determining novel structures. The work on the
stereochemistry of coordination compounds was considerably broadened, and
besides new organic compounds of platinum, included compounds of zinc,
cadmium and ruthenium. Low temperature work was extended down to 34°K. Cox
led the bid for an ICL Pegasus computer for the university. When it was
installed in 1957 in a former Methodist chapel across the road from the
Chemistry Department, his crystallographers were immediately the largest
users. <p>
        When Cox moved to Leeds, he took the view, which he had learned from
Haworth, that his first duty was to his department. He was very supportive
of his staff. He built up the department in many areas apart from
crystallography and placed much emphasis on the teaching of students. His
administrative skills and good sense drew him increasingly into the general
running of the university and onto regional and national committees. When he
could be enticed into an X-ray lab, the typical reaction afterwards was
"E.G.C. really knows his stuff, why can't he come down more often?" <p>
        He was Chairman of the X-ray Analysis Group, one of the precursors
of the BCA, from 1956 to 1959. He was a member of the Agricultural Research
Council from 1957 to 1960. This led to his departure from Leeds in 1960,
when he was appointed Secretary of the ARC. He retired from this post in
1971. An especially moving tribute to his work was paid by Tam Dalyell MP in
The Independent of 8 July 1996, who wrote of the trouble he took to educate
"political Pippins"- "likely young grafts in Parliament"- through visits to
the Fruit Research Station and in other ways. "Never was there a more
impressive, energetic advocate of the value to society of long-term serious
scientific inquiry." <p>

        In Seattle in August 1996, Ted Baker of Massey University, New
Zealand was elected as the new President of the International Union of
Crystallography. He must be deemed a crystallographic great-grandchild of
Cox's. His Ph.D supervisor was T.N.M.Waters, who had been a student of
F.J.Llewellyn in Auckland. Llewellyn learnt his crystallography in
Birmingham from Cox in the work on pentaerythritol.<p> 
        I owe my crystallographic career entirely to Cox. I had not even
heard of the subject, when in October 1945 I received a letter from him
inviting me to have a talk "to see whether we could arrange something to our
mutual advantage." This invitation arose solely from a casual remark to him
by someone who was aware of my post-war career uncertainties. The outcome
was that I joined his Leeds team in April 1946 as a temporary research
assistant. I found myself in an unfamiliar but very stimulating environment.
Owing to the stimuli, I wandered well away from the tasks intended for me.
None the less, Cox was very encouraging. Later on he invited me, a
non-chemist, to join his staff. I cannot forget his support nor the lively
atmosphere generated among the Pippins. <p>
        Gordon's first wife Lucie, a school friend from Bath, died in 1962.
They had two children: Patricia, now retired as a very senior Civil Servant,
and Keith, a petrologist at Oxford and like his father an FRS. Six years
after Lucie's death he married Professor Mary Truter, his long-standing
colleague from Leeds. To Patricia, Keith and Mary the BCA expresses its
profound sympathy at Gordon's passing.<p>
