<h2>John Rollett and Chemical Crystallography</h2>

        In the summer of 1951 John Rollett and I went to the International
Crystallographic Congress in Stockholm.  After the meeting, we took the
night train to Trondheim for a 10-day hike through the Jotunheim - the
giant's home - the highest Norwegian mountain area.  On the first day a
flock of goats followed us as we made our way through the woods to the
plateau above.  The second day was misty and we saw nothing from the top of
Norway's highest mountain.  The surviving photographs show John standing in
the snow, his feet shod in ex service boots and carrying his gas cape,
clothed in flannel trousers, sports jacket, college scarf and beret - not
exactly the outfit of today's high tech all-Goretex fell walker.  But we
had much enjoyment in the Jotunheim, despite getting wet through at least
once.
<p>
        On another day the sun shone brilliantly and we set off to go up
Norway's second highest mountain.  Half way up we rested;  the sun was
warm, the view was marvellous;  and indolence was very tempting.  So I
announced that I proposed to succumb to temptation and to climb no further.
 John was properly shocked at such lethargy, but without more fuss he went
on to the top alone.  It was a very characteristic example of his admirable
energy and determination.
<p>
        His scientific career had begun in 1949 when he joined Professor
Gordon Cox's group at Leeds in chemical crystallography.  He did a splendid
Ph.D. on the crystal structure of dimethyl triacetylene under the
supervision of George Jeffrey.  During that time Eddie Hughes, from Cal
Tech - the pioneer in 1941 of the use of least squares in crystallography -
was on sabbatical in Leeds.
<p>
        Eddie recognised John's great abilities, and as a result John went
as a post-doc in 1953 to Linus Pauling's lab in California.  There he did
more crystal structures, collaborating with Jack Dunitz and others.  But
more importantly he did some least-squares programming on the primitive
Electrodata Datatron computer which Cal Tech had recently acquired.<p>
        As a spin off from that work, he got involved with Cohen and Dumond
in their revision of the best values of the fundamental atomic constants of
physics - the charge on the electron, the Avagadro number, etc.  This
analysis of variance led in 1955 to a much quoted paper on the Atomic
Constants.  Eddie Hughes told me later that Professor Dumond thought so
well of John that he felt Cal Tech had been crazy not to have tried to keep
John.<p>
        So in 1955, John returned to England to a Fellowship in Dorothy
Hodgkin's laboratory.  From then on Oxford was his base.  Here in this
University he made his great contributions to crystallographic computing. 
After a preliminary venture on the prototype Ferranti Pegasus computer, he
turned his attention in January 1956 to the English Electric DEUCE computer
which had been installed at the National Physical Laboratory.  Very quickly
he produced a string of programmes for complex crystallographic
calculations.  First of course, he had to work out the necessary very
general algorithms to handle the 230 space groups of crystallography - in
this he could build on his previous experience.  Then he had to do the
actual machine code programming.  To those of us using the Ferranti Mark I
machine in Manchester, the thought of programming DEUCE was a nightmare. 
John just lapped it up;  he revelled in its complexities.  He enjoyed
conquering its possibilities.<p>
        The store capacity of DEUCE was then a mere 8000 words on drum, and
some 400 words on faster access.  A multiplication took 2 milliseconds;  an
addition was 30 times faster.  It was possible to do other operations while
multiplication was in progress - John wrote "it [was] possible to practise
"time-sharing" to the point of doing four different things at once" - - of
course, provided you were clever enough - and John was.  He told me "I can
usually keep the multiplier of DEUCE running about 3/4 of the time - which
would be tough it I couldn't prepare the next multiplication meanwhile".<p>
        The programmes he produced were so good that many of the users in
this country and abroad had no real idea of what John had done for them.  A
few users most certainly had that appreciation, but I do believe that his
name ought to have appeared as a co-author on many papers reporting crystal
structure determinations.<p>
        He continued his good work when Oxford got its Ferranti Mercury
computer around 1958 - by then he was in the University Computing
Laboratory.  I can pick out only some highlights.  In 1962 he organized in
Oxford a Summer School on Computing Methods in Crystallography and edited
the resulting book.  The emphasis was not on programming, but on Methods. 
John gave more lectures than anyone else, and he delivered them, as always,
very clearly, very audibly, and beautifully arranged.  He had become very
interested in matrix algebra, and the applications of latent roots and
vectors in the convergence of iterative least-squares processes.<p>
        In late 1961 the UGC authorized the purchase of a new series of
computers - the English Electric KDF9 - for delivery to Oxford and other
universities two or three years later.  John immediately wrote to me - 23
November 1961 - not only proposing cooperation in program design.  "My
feeling is that it matters more to establish common forms of lists, this
time, than to discuss programming details.  Previously I was willing to do
anything about other data provided the planes tape was standard, but now I
want standard lists of parameters, cell dimensions, form factors, symmetry
operations, ...".  This was the origin of a very effective collaboration
between Oxford, Glasgow, Leeds and Sydney, which resulted in an extensive
set of data structures agreed in May 1964.  These Lists have allowed
portability as programs have developed over the years and machines have
changed.  Indeed John's data structures, suitably updated, are a major
feature of the current widely used Oxford system of programs called
CRYSTALS.<p>
        Many of John's ideas remain extremely fruitful in crystallography. 
Only last month, I found great help in two of his papers from 1965 and
1970.  Despite the switch of his main activity to the Computing Laboratory,
he continued to be very interested in crystallography and crystallographers
- in 1989 he contributed to an important paper in Acta Crystallographica on
Statistical Descriptors.<p>

        John had been a friend of mine for 45 years.  I felt a deep grief
when I heard of his sudden death.  On behalf of the crystallographic
community in this country and abroad, I offer to Constance and Anthony,
Penny and Helen and their families our deepest sympathy at their tragic
loss.  John will not be forgotten by crystallographers.

<h3>Appendix on some technical points</h3>

John Rollett joined Professor Cox's crystallographic group in 1949.  Cox
had a long involvement with crystallographic calculations: 
three-dimensional Fourier syntheses with hundreds of Fourier coefficients
had been computed pre-war with the aid of Beevers-Lipson strips;  punched
card machines had been used since 1946/7;  use of the Ferranti Mark I
across the Pennines at Manchester University began in 1952.<p>
        The Electrodata Datatron at Cal Tech:  words 10 binary coded
decimal;  drum 4000 words plus 20x4 words in quick access loops;  x 8.5
msec, + 2 msec.<p>
        DEUCE:  words 32 bits;  21 mercury delay lines of assorted lengths
total 402 words;  drum 8192 words;  punched card in/out;  x 2 msec, + 0.064
msec.<p>
        Mercury (1960):  words 40 bits:  ferrite cores 1024 words;  drums
16,384 words;  paper tape in/out;  Floating Point x 0.300 msec, FP + 160
msec, 8 B-lines.<p>
        The operating systems and compilers initially available for the
KDF9 computers were very disappointing.  Despite the inter-university
cooperation over crystallographic data structures, incompatibility of
operating systems resulted in Oxford and Glasgow writing separate systems
of crystallographic programs.<p>
