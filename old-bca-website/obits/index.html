<strong><a name="jakh02">Congratulations</a>
 to <a href="#jakh">Judith Howard</a></strong> on her
election to the Fellowship of Royal Society announced on 13 May 2002<br> 
The citation reads as follows:<br><br>
<b>Professor Judith Ann Kathleen Howard (née Duckworth) CBE</b>, Professor
of Chemistry, University of Durham. Professor Howard is elected as a General
Candidate first because of her pioneering developments in X-ray and neutron
crystallography, which have encompassed organic, organometallic and
inorganic compounds, and secondly because of her major contribution to the
wider chemical and crystallographic community in terms of education and
public understanding.<br><br>

 Congratulations to Prof Judith Howard, Durham on the 
award of an EPSRC Senior Fellowship from 1998 to 2003
<h2><a name="frs98">New Fellows</a> of the Royal Society for 1998</h2> 
On 14 May 1998 the Royal Society elected 40 new Fellows and 5 new Foreign 
members. Those of interest to crystallographers are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Harshad Kumar Dharamshi Hansrasj Bhadeshia</strong> Reader in Physical Metallurgy, Dept Materials Science and Metallurgu, University of Cambridge<br>for his work on the theory of solid state phase transformations, 
in particular the prediction and verification of micro-structural development 
in multi-component steels. He has used the theory to design novel steels, 
resistant to wear and impact deformation, which in turn has helped in the 
large scale manufacture of new rail steels.
  <li><strong>David Keith Bowen</strong> President of Bede Scientific Inc.
 Denver, USA<br>
for his contributions in applied physics and instrumentation to nanonscience 
and metrology. He has instrumented precision techniques for general use.While
 at Warwick University he was the prime mover in setting up the X-ray 
topography line at the Daresbury Laboratory, which has now been operating 
successfully for over a decade.
</ul>
<h2><a name="mcmahon">19 Jan </a> 1998</h2><br>
Congratulations to our IUCr99 logo designer, Malcolm McMahon, on the recent 
award of two prestigious prizes. 
<ul>
  <li>In May at the EDPDIC-97 conference held in Parma, Italy, he received 
the 'EPDIC Award 1997' and presented the opening paper of the Conference 
describing his work. (EPDIC stands for the European Powder
DIffraction Conference). The citation for the prize was for 'outstanding
scientific contribution in the field of powder diffraction'.
  <li>Prof. Malcolm Cooper, University of Warwick, of the European 
Synchrotron Radiation Society, (ESRS), recently sent me this news item.
<p>
To mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of synchrotron radiation the 
ESRS has awarded a prize for outstanding reseach by a young scientist
working at a European synchroton. The prize was to be awarded for work done
since 1994 by someone under 35. <p>

The winner was Malcolm McMahon, who is based at the Daresbury Laboratory. 
He has made a significant contribution to the study of materials at high
pressures. It is a perfect example of how innovative experimental technique
transforms into new science. Together with Professor Richard Nelmes he has
cleverly exploited the advantages of image plate detectors and applying the
Rietveld refinement technique. They have moved this area of work forward and
away from the limitations that were imposed by the energy dispersive
technique. Exciting results have bee obtained at both Daresbury and the ESRF
on the high pressure structures of InSb, Si, Ge, HgSc, and a host of
materials. In an impressive array of publications, they reported new and
enexpected structural complexities and settles what were old standing
problems.

The prize was awarded in November at the International Conference on
Highlights in Synchrotron Radiation Research held in Grenoble, France, where
Malcolm gave an invited talk on his work.
<p>
Malcolm's <a href="#mcm1">earlier award of a Royal Society Fellowship</a>
 was reported in 1996, and his design for the  IUCr99 logo was published in 
'Crystallography News' June 96, page 9.

director of SATRO North Scotland at the University of Aberdeen, who wins the
<strong>Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and Prize for 1998 </strong>
for her outstanding and
prolonged contribution to the public understanding of physics, particularly
in Scotland, by the managing of the financial, human and technological
resources requires for running SATRO North Scotland and for organising

   <li> Congratulations to <strong>Brian Bellamy</strong> on winning the
 Industrial Group Award
for 1996 for his innovative work on analysis at A.E.R.E., Harwell. 
   <li><a name="mcm1">1996 </a>
has been a very good year for <strong>Malcolm McMahon
</strong>who won the IUCr99 logo competition with his design based on C60,
thus anticipating the award of the Nobel Prize for 1996 for the discovery of
C60. <br>
 Now we hear the welcome news of his award of a Royal Society
University Research Fellowship, lastng initially for 5 years, with possible
extensions up to a total of 10 years,  The fellowship will be held in the
Department of Physics of the University of Liverpool, where he has joined
Bill Stirling's condensed matter group. The title of the Fellowship is
"X-ray diffraction studies of highly-condensed matter". The work will be
high-pressure diffraction studies, principally using SRS and, to a lesser
extent, ISIS, and also ESRF. The work at SRS will mainly be the development
of a high-temperature capability to extend the scope of the high-pressure
image-plate system developed by Richard Nelmes' group to in situ
high-temperature/high-pressure studies.
