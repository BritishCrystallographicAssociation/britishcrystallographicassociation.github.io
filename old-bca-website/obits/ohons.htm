The names of deceased Honorary members are listed below in
alphabetical order of surname, with brief summaries of their achievements,
where further information is available there is a link to it with the word

  <li><strong><em>Arnold Beevers  1908 - 2001</em></strong>
<a href="cvs/beev.html">info</a><BR>
One of the two originators of the <em>Beevers-Lipson</em> strips, which
enabled Fourier calculations to be made as part of structure solutions in
the days before computers were available. Carried out many early structure
determinations. Latterly set up Beevers Miniature Model Unit, which now
exports molecular models  throughout the world, and provides useful work 
for the disabled in the Edinburgh area. <br><br>

<a href="../cnews/1997/jun97/megaw.html">info</a><BR>
Distinguished scientist from the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge, where she
was a student of J D Bernal. Made the first structure determination of a
ferroelectric material, barium titanate. Early determination of ice
structure led to her having an island in the Antarctic named after her.
Major contributor on the structures of felspars.<br><br>
