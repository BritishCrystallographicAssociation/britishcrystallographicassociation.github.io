<h1>Remembering Dorothy Hodgkin</h1>
 <br>
<p>
The first time I met Dorothy was in Auburn, Alabama, in the 
summer of 1948, when she was visiting the United States for the 
first International Congress of Crystallography; the second time was 
some eight months later, in Oxford.  That we were in Oxford was 
Dorothy's doing.  We had left Alabama in unusual circumstances, 
almost as refugees, and that David had a subsequent career in 
crystallography was largely owing to Dorothy.  She was a very 
great arranger.  She found room for David in her laboratory, she 
arranged for his admission to Balliol so that he could matriculate 
for a D.  Phil., and when the Fulbright people announced that there 
would be no science fellowships given in Britain that year, Dorothy 
--- who had heard a rumor of this --- had already "taken the 
liberty," to use her own words, of arranging for a Rockefeller grant 
for David's support.  The extraordinary thoughtfulness was typical 
of Dorothy.
 <br>
<p>
We had a marvelous time in Oxford.  We rented a 6-bedroom 
furnished house just north of the Parks, and took in lodgers to pay 
the rent.  Dorothy didn't really approve of this grandiosity; in her 
eyes, I think, I was then and forever a typical spoiled American 
brat.  But one way and another it all worked out.  I had a job 
editing children's books at the Oxford University Press, for six 
pounds a week --- a miraculous job, magically available for one 
year only.  I did some odd jobs for Thomas Hodgkin at the 
University Extramural Delegacy.  David did the structure of 
lumisterol, and --- more important by far --- was having ideas about 
the phase problem which emerged in his thesis.  Altogether, for 
some of the best and happiest years of our lives, we are forever 
indebted to Dorothy.
 <br>
<p>
We are far from the only people so indebted.  What should be 
remembered about Dorothy forever is what she did for so many 
people.  That she was an inspired teacher is demonstrated by the 
creative lives of those whom she taught.  But she taught so much 
more than science, by which I mean that extraordinary and 
illuminating humaneness once characteristic of the world of 
crystallography because of the example and guidance of such as 
she.
 <br>
<p>
I refer, of course, to what might be called an Age of Innocence, 
when crystallography occupied a small, rather overlooked, certainly 
obscure corner in the world of science.  It was very small indeed --- 
in those days a meeting such as this one could be held in a large 
living room; an international congress drew from all over the world 
a scant 200 people.  All crystallographers knew each other; they 
were neighbors; they were closer than that --- siblings, you might 
say, brothers and sisters sharing a family ambition for a field of 
science, and very little motivated by a drive for personal power.  
Competitiveness had not yet set in.  This small society, this group 
of friends, learned from its teachers, from none more than Dorothy, 
the delight of sharing and caring, the positive joy of mutual 
helpfulness and supportiveness, of kindness and responsibility 
towards each other.  It is impossible to express in contemporary 
terms the nature of that society --- its warmth, its openness, its 
pervasive sense of fun: indeed, its radiance.
 <br>
<p>
There was not always perfect agreement: I speak of humans, not 
angels.  When I decided to write about Rosalind Franklin's DNA 
work, Dorothy was discouraging, I think partly because she felt I 
was diving into waters too deep for me to swim in.  But she was 
not herself confrontational.  She had her ways, often very effective, 
of dealing with situations, wasting no energy on fruitless clashes or 
time on what was beyond rectifying.  her comments on the 
manuscript of Rosalind Franklin and DNA were sparse, and limited 
to technical points --- discussion of what I was trying to do came 
from Thomas.  But this too Dorothy taught by her example --- that 
being of one mind was not necessary, but that honesty was 
essential, and always to be respected.
 <br>
<p>
We live now in a rougher world and a harsher climate, but that 
makes it all the more important to remember kinder and more 
generous times.  Nothing is the same; certainly the world of 
crystallography has vastly changed.  It is a large world now, and a 
powerful one; in productivity it has more than surpassed the hopes 
of those who worked with enthusiasm and faith and very primitive 
tools.  It is too romantic to recollect the history of crystallography 
as an Eden lost, but it would be good and useful to remember that it 
was a kindly place to live, an oasis of civility, but not interested, 
really, in its potential for fetching in fame, riches, or glory.  Those 
were good times.  They couldn't last; they didn't.  But I am truly 
sorry for those of you too young to have enjoyed that sweeter time; 
you'd have liked it.
 <br>
<p>
The good times were not accidental.  They were created by 
Dorothy, and by those like her.  Few were her equal in generosity 
of spirit, breadth of mind, cultivated humaneness, or gift for giving.  
She should be remembered not only for a lifetime's succession of 
brilliantly achieved structures.  While those who knew her, 
experienced her quiet and modest and extremely powerful 
influence, learned from her more than the positioning of atoms in 
the three-dimensional molecule, she will be remembered not only 
with respect, and reverence, and gratitude, but more than anything 
else, with love.  Let that be her lasting memorial.
