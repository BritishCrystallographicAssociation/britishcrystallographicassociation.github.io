<h1>Alun Bowen, 1942 - 1996 </h1>
<p> 
  <strong> Alun Wynn Lloyd Bowen</strong> was born on 26 November 1942.
 He received his higher 
education at the Universities of Nottingham and Manchester, where he was 
awarded his PhD in 1968. He joined what was then known as the Royal Aircraft 
Establishment, Farnborough in 1967. He worked in a number of sections there 
and became head of the Metal Physics and Micro-structural Analysis Section 
in 1979. He was a Visiting Professor at Strathclyde.  <p>
  At first, Alun's work at RAE was concerned with investigating and 
understanding the properties of titanium and, later, of aluminium alloys. 
This led to his interest in preferred orientations in the crystal grains 
that compose a metal object. He developed further his understanding of the 
origin and influence of crystallographic textures on the engineering 
properties of alloys and manufactured components. An essential adjunct of 
this work was the development of methods of texture measurement, including 
the application of quantitative measurements.<p>  
  His work was successful to the point where he was acclaimed
internationally  as one of the foremost experts in the field.  His
outstanding contribution  was the pioneering of many applications of x-ray
diffraction techniques to  solving real engineering problems, both with
newer alloys and those already  in service. He worked continuously on
bridging the gap between theoretical  advances and cost effective
application of textural analysis to industrial  developments. More recently,
he worked with many of his industrial peers in  introducing the technique of
residual stress analysis as a vital tool for  understanding manufacturing
results and component service performance.    <p>
  His great interest in the practical applications of all these techniques
led  to extensive contacts with industrial crystallographers and to his 
association with the Industrial Group of the BCA. He served on the IG 
Committee for eight years, from 1984 to 1992, the last three years as Group 
Chairman and served as an elected member of the Council of the BCA. He was 
active in arranging IG functions as well as organising conferences for the 
Institute of Materials and worked hard on some of its committees.   <p>
  Known as "Mr Texture" to industry and academia, he had a modest and 
unassuming manner and was noted for his unfailing courtesy, patience and the 
clarity with which he explained complex concepts. Away from work, Alun 
enjoyed listening to music on a serious high-fidelity set-up. He was a 
fluent French speaker and family holidays in France were a great joy to him. 
The last of Alun's many lectures was delivered - with his usual polish - at 
the BCA Spring Meeting in Cambridge in April 1996. Shortly afterwards, he 
was readmitted to hospital where he died on 7 May 1996. We extend our 
condolences to Chris and their daughter Clare. We are all impoverished by 
his passing.   <p>
