<h2>Death of Durward Cruickshank</h2>
<i>"The Times"</i> of Thursday 9 August 2007 carried an obituary of one of our 
oldest Honorary members, Durward Cruickshank, born 7 March 1924, died 13 July
2007.
<a name="06jan"><hr></a>
<h2>Death of Robert Crispin Evans</h2>
Our oldest Honorary member died on 18 December 2005 at Hinchingbrooke
 Hospital, Huntingdon at the age of 96. He was Emeritus
Fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge.  His
funeral was held at the West Chapel, Cambridge Crematorium on 
Wednesday 4 January 2006 at 11-15 am. An appreciation will be published 
later in 'Crystallography News'.

<h2>Death of Robin Shirley </h2>
We were sorry to learn that Robin Shirley (born 1941) died in hospital on 
Sunday, 17th March 2005. He contracted Hepatitis A last November
and subsequent liver problems proved fatal on Easter Sunday.
He will be remembered for his 'Crysfire' software, his poetry shown
at IUCr99 in Glasgow, and for his enthusiasm for the preservation of old computers.

<h2>Death of Gen Shirane</h2>
Gen Shirane, a giant in the field of neutron scattering, died 
suddenly on Sunday, January 16, 2005.  Gen had a 50 year career in 
neutron scattering, most of it working at Brookhaven's High Flux Beam 
Reactor.  He performed many seminal experiments and published more 
that 700 papers on a wide variety of topics ranging from 
ferroelectricity to low dimensional solids and High Tc.

<h2>Death of Mary Truter</h2>
UCL announced in December that Prof Mary Truter died on
26th November 2004.  Her funeral was held on 7 December 2004
at Golders Green Crematorium.<br><br>
Chick Wilson writes:<br>
"Jackie" was a founder member of the BCA and held a number of posts over 
the years.  She was a regular attender of BCA meetings until quite 
recently.  We anticipate publishing an obituary in a future issue of 
Crystallography News.

<h2>Death of Francis Crick</h2>
Francis Crick first studied physics and later found he was more interested
in biology. He is probably best known for his collaboration with J.D.Watson
in 1953 when they discovered the structure of DNA. Together with the
experimentalist M.Wilkins they received a Nobel prize in 1962 for this
discovery. After some years at the MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, he went to
the Salk Institute in California. He was born 8 June 1916 in Northampton and
died  in San Diego 28 July 2004, aged 88. An obituary was published in 'The
Times' of 30 July 2004. 

<br><br>
Further pages on this site give details of celebrations of the fiftieth
anniversary of the discovery and a list of books.

<H2>Professor Carl-Ivar Brändén</H2><BR>Dear Crystallographer,<BR>&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Our dear friend, Carl-Ivar Brändén, passed away on 28th April 2004. He 
will be buried on the 28th May, 14:00 at Vårdsätra herrgård in 
Uppsala.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted the burial to be open to everyone, but did 
not expect his friends outside Sweden to come to it. Instead he hoped that if 
there were a memorial symposium, on that occasion his friends might like to 
attend.<BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;We hope to be able to arrange such a memorial in the 
autumn. Please let us know if you would like to join us. Feel free to pass on

<H2>Death of Bill Mitchell</H2>
<P><EM>'The Times'</EM> of Friday 8 November 2002 published an obituary of Sir 
William Mitchell, who died in Reading on 30th October 2002 aged 77.<BR>His 
research interests in physics were wide ranging. He was particulalry interested 
in the effects of defects on material properties and so in the production of 
such defects throuh irradiation damage. He was chairman of the Diamond Research 
Fund for many years. Work with early reactors at Harwell and Aldermaston 
encouraged his lifelong interest in the uses of neutron scattering; he 
negotiated an equal partnership for the UK with France and Germany in the 
Insitut Laue Langevin in Grenoble. During his chairmanship of the Science and 
Engineering research Council the spallation neutron source, ISIS, was 
commissioned at the Rutherford Appleton laboratory. He nutured many 
collaborations with colleagues from the Continent; became vice-president of the 
European Science Foundation and was chairman of the Council of CERN for a 
time.</P>

<P>Andrew Lang has sent me the following note:<BR><BR>I cannot remember if I 
told you of the unexpected death of our distinguished <A 
href="http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/Obits/CF.html">Sir Charles Frank </A>OBE, 
FRS on the day our St.Andrews conference started, 5 April. He will be greatly 
missed. He was a first-class crystallographer; the screw-dislocation theory of 
crystal growth was his idea. 
<P>'<EM>The Times'</EM> today published an obituary of Sir Charles Frank, OBE, 
FRS who died in Bristol on April 5th aged 87. In addition to the screw 
dislocation theory, he also made contributions to the field of liquid crystals, 
(used today in computer displays) and to cold nuclear fusion. In 1947 he 
suggested that muons might be able to catalyse the fusion of deuterium and 
tritium. Experiments to verify this are continuing today. He also worked on the 
crystallisation and chain folding of polymers. <EM>'The Times' </EM>appears to 
think the general public will remember him for his wartime activitie; his great 
observational skills were used to scan aerial reconnaissance photographs of 
German anti-aircraft radar installations. He spotted vital very small clues 
which led to successful identification of rotating radar antennae by the 
variation in their shadows on successive images. 
<P>After the war he went to Bristol University, becoming Henry Overton Wills 
professor of Physics and director of the laboratory until his nominal retirement 
in 1976. 
<P>In physics as in his intelligence work, his breakthroughs were due to clear, 
elegant thiinking about three dimensional structures.
