John and Inge Robertson in 1988<br>
at Arnold Beever's 80th birthday party
</center>
<P>
John Robertson was brought up in China where his parents were Christian
missionaries. (In 1980 he claimed to know no Chinese 
<em>"We were not allowed to
talk to the servants".</em>)  He attended the University of Edinburgh and
graduated in chemistry in 1946. He then began work on a Ph.D. under the
supervision of C.A Beevers.  These were the first days of the determination
of absolute configuration, with much friendly rivalry between Arnold Beevers
and J.M. Bijvoet in Utrecht, both of whom worked on salts of strychnine. 
John studied the chloride, bromide and iodide salts, and his beautifully
developed and labelled normal-beam Weissenberg photographs are still
preserved in Edinburgh. He solved the structure of the bromide, in
P2<SUB>1</SUB>2<SUB>1</SUB>2<SUB>1</SUB>, on the basis of the three
projections and then refined in three dimensions to determine the chirality. 
Happily, the Bijvoet group determined the same hand for the selenate salt!
Meanwhile, the samples also survived,  and the structure of the chloride,
which gives pseudo-orthorhombic  monoclinic crystals with <I>Z'</I> = 2, was
solved by one of us (ROG) in 1980, using John's crystals.  Sadly, COSHH
regulations eventually resulted in their disposal!

From 1951-54, John had a happy post-doctoral period in Dorothy Hodgkin's
group working on, the SeCN and the hexacarboxylic acid derivatives of
vitamin B<SUB>12</SUB>. He has described this period in 
" <I>Memories of Dorothy Hodgkin,Structural Studies of Molecules of Biological Interest</I>",Ed. G.Dodson, J.P .Glusker and D.Sayre (1961)72-78. 

<P> In 1954 he joined E.G.Cox's group in the University of Leeds. Here, used 
his great experimental skill to build an instrument to allow X-ray
photographs to be taken of a crystal at the temperature of liquid hydrogen.
He used it to study ammonium oxalate monohydrate. MRT remembers working on
it with him all day and seeing non-matching earrings when I got home. I
teased him with failure of observation. Quick as a flash he said "I did
notice, but as it was you, I thought it must be the <I>dernier cri </I>!"
Later he undertook the neutron study of this elegant compound.  Various
thoughtful publications followed, on oxalates, thiophenic acids,
monosaccharides and coordination compounds of iron and nickel.  He was
promoted to Senior Lecturer. Apart from a period (1965-8) on secondment as
the founding Professor of Chemistry in the University College of
Dar-es-Salaam, he remained in Leeds for the rest of his life. This period in
Tanzania was a watershed. A visitor remarked on the great strain imposed on
John and his family. After his return, original experimental work seems to
have ceased.  Nonetheless, various Heads of Department did not allow him to
take early retirement because, being totally unselfish, he was much too
useful. For example, he ran the Colvin Room, a common room and library for
chemistry students of Leeds University. He served the IUCr as an excellent
Book Review Editor for its journals from 1975 to 1987. He then became
Chairman of the IUCr-OUP Book Series Committee from its inception in 1987
until 1996, well after his fiscal retirement.</p>  

<P> His experience as a sandy-haired person in the sun showed at the 1969
IUCR meeting when the conference excursion took the form of 5 hours on an
Atlantic beach on Long Island. As we were warned in the coaches on the way,
this is the latitude of Madrid. Walking along the shore was an unmistakable
figure in hat, mackintosh, trousers and shoes. His last years were saddened
by the long illness of his very dear wife Inge, which prevented him
travelling, and after her death by his own incapacity.</p>

<P> Many people will remember him as a widely-read and civilised person with
a very lively sense of humour, shared with his Ph.D. supervisor Arnold
Beevers, with whom he remained on good terms throughout his life. He gave a
memorably uproarious lecture at Arnold's 70<SUP>th</SUP> Birthday
celebration in 1978, the photograph above was taken ten years later at the
80<SUP>th</SUP> birthday party.<br><br>
 He was always very fond of children.  ROG's
daughter remembers him as "the man at crystallography meetings who drew cats
on my knees."  His sincere but undogmatic Christian belief was the guiding
spirit of his life; a typical example was that his Christmas cards always
consisted of photographs of his family with a montage of 'Peace and Joy'. 
We conclude with an extract from the passage he wrote to be used at his
funeral:</p>

<P><em>
"All life is finite. This is the way God designed the natural order.
Successive generations are cradled in the arms of their forebears. We
ourselves would not be here if death, as well as life, were not normal
throughout the whole of nature.  To be sure, human life is special. We can
feel God's love for us and can respond and so live in a dimension infinitely
rich and profoundly significant."</em>
