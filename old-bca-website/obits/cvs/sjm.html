Election Address when Candidate for Treasurer in 1996<br>
The retiring BCA Treasurer has done a wonderful job in simplifying the
administration of the Association and its accounts, and maintaining sound
financial management. I would like to continue those policies - sound financial
management will be particularly important in the run-up to the 1999 IUCr
Congress in Glasgow - and believe I am best-placed to do this, for three
reasons. Firstly, I have been Secretary and Treasurer of the Chemical
Crystallography Group for the past two years, where I have strived to put the
group on a firmer financial footing by obtaining industrial sponsorship for
meetings and by the proposed separation of the group from The Royal Society of
Chemistry. Secondly, I have a background of working in industry and therefore
have some knowledge and experience of dealing with legal and accounts people
and systems - and have a couple of nice suits ! - and thirdly, I am currently
based in Cambridge, geographically close to the retiring Treasurer, which
should ease any transition. I hope I can therefore be considered to be "a safe
pair of hands" !<br><br>
<em>Editor's Note</em> Steve later worked as the Manager of the DARTS
service at the Daresbury Laboratory, before returning to Cambridge to work
at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.
