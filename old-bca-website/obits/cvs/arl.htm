Professor Andrew Richard Lang<br><br>

1975 Fellow of the Royal Society<br>
1997 Gave the BCA Lonsdale lecture<br> 
1997 Hughes Medal of the Royal Society<br>
2002 Honorary member of BCA<br>
2005 Senior Research Fellow and Emeritus Professor of Physics,
    University of Bristol<br><br>

Distinguished for his pioneering studies in X-ray diffraction physics,
especially for his developments of the techniques of X-ray topography. These
image imperfections in crystals: such as dislocations, stacking faults,
growth-sector boundaries and ferromagnetic domains. For half a century,
Lang's methods have been widely used in the assessment of crystals for the
electronics and other industries. He has studied many types of X-ray
diffraction phenomena, including X-ray moir&eacute; fringes, the first direct
observation of a refractive index for X rays greater than unity, and
Borrmann-Lehmann fringes. Perhaps his most important discovery in this
 category was
that of Pendell&ouml;sung fringes (with Norio Kato in 1959) in wedge-shaped
perfect crystals, which are due to intensity variations of the internal
wave-field. The fringe spacing led to the determination of absolute
structure amplitudes. </p>

Lang has also made important discoveries using other techniques, especially
electron microscropy and cathodoluminescence, separately and in combination
with X-ray topography; and he has studied a wide range of crystalline
materials: including metals, semiconductors, quartz and diamond.
His work exhibits sustained innovativeness, craftmanship in experimentation,
and perceptiveness and thoroughness in the analysis of experiments.
