<h2>European Science Foundation Latsis Prize 2000</h2>

<p>
The European Science Foundation has awarded this year's European Latsis
Prize to Professor Kenneth Charles Holmes, Director of the Max Planck
Institut für Medizinische Forschung, for his outstanding contributions to
structural biology, studies of great scientific and social significance for
European progress. The prize, worth 100,000 Swiss Francs, is awarded by the
ESF to an individual or group who, in the opinion of their peers, has made
the greatest contribution to a particular field of European research. The
chosen field of the 2000 prize was 'molecular structure'.

Throughout his career, Professor Holmes has been a major figure in
structural biology. He was a pioneer in the development of both theoretical
and experimental X-ray diffraction methods for elucidating the structures of
biological macromolecules. His work in the 1960's on the development of
stronger X-ray sources paved the way for the novel use of synchrotron
radiation as an X-ray source for the studies of the structure of matter,
particularly for biological structures. His work has been essential for
revealing the atomic structures of the proteins actin and myosin in muscle.
He is acknowledged as a leading authority on the mechanism by which the
contractile protein components of muscle turn the chemical energy of ATP
into work.

In the early 1970's Kenneth Holmes and his student Gerd Rosenbaum were the
first to build an optical bench for X-ray diffraction at a synchrotron.
Their demonstration of X-ray diffraction from insect muscle using
synchrotron radiation at DESY, in Hamburg, in 1971 was a major breakthrough.
The results paved the way for the establishment of the EMBL outstation at
DESY where Holmes served as acting head during its founding years.
