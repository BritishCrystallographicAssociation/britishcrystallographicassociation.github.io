      <P>David Blow was an early pioneer of protein crystallography, a superbly 
      productive method which, over the last 40 years, has revealed the detailed 
      atomic structures of thousands of proteins, all of them important in 
      biology or medicine.</P>
      <P>Using his mathematical skills and unique ability to organise the many 
      developments needed on a broad front, Blow made key contributions to the 
      theory and practice of protein crystallography while simultaneously 
      solving the structure of a number of important proteins. He trained many 
      students and continued to produce lucid articles and books right up to his 
      death.</P>
      <P>Born in Birmingham in 1931, the second son of a Methodist minister, 
      David Blow had a somewhat nomadic education prior to attending Kingswood 
      School, Bath, where he and his brother Ralph developed their interest in 
      physics. Ralph went to Oxford but David won an open scholarship to Corpus 
      Christi College, Cambridge, where he was an undergraduate and graduate 
      student, delayed only by National Service with the RAF, where he learned 
      to fly gliders, met Ronnie Corbett and Jim Biddulph, and had the 
      occasional brush with early death.</P>
      <P>As a young scientist graduating in Physics from the Cavendish 
      Laboratory at Cambridge in 1954, he was looking for an exciting area of 
      research when a friend told him about an Austrian scientist, Max Perutz, 
      working in the Cavendish, who was good at getting money. Blow was thrilled 
      to learn about the work Perutz was doing and immediately accepted the 
      offer to become his student. Perutz, having been a student of Desmond 
      Bernal and Lawrence Bragg, now headed a small Medical Research Council 
      Unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems with 
      funds for a research student.</P>
      <P>Twenty years earlier, Perutz had been inspired by Bernal's statement 
      that the secret of life lay in the structure of proteins and the only way 
      to find the structure was by using X-ray crystallography. When Blow joined 
      the unit in late 1954, there was still no sign of any protein structure 
      and opinion among many was that the task was impossible. Perutz himself 
      had commented that attempting to analyse the structure of a protein seemed 
      on the face of it about as promising as a journey to the moon.</P>
      <P>As it happened, the protein Perutz had chosen to study, on which Blow 
      joined him, was haemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in the blood, whose atomic 
      structure was eventually determined in 1968, a year before man first 
      landed on the moon. Blow therefore began his research career by learning 
      to purify and crystallise horse, pig, dog and rabbit haemoglobin, and to 
      characterise the crystals.</P>
      <P>In 1953, Perutz had recognised that the "isomorphous replacement" 
      method might be able to solve the structure of protein crystals. This 
      involved attaching chemically, to precise positions in the protein, one or 
      two atoms of a heavy metal such as mercury which would scatter X-rays 
      strongly, producing small changes to the intensities of X-ray beams. In 
      principle, these small changes were exactly what was needed to solve the 
      crystal structure, but in practice a great deal of theory was still 
      required and it was this challenge that Blow found exciting.</P>
      <P>Blow came up with a rigorous general method for data analysis, 
      implemented it on the Edsac I computer and used it to determine the 
      projection structure of horse haemoglobin. He discussed his approach with 
      Francis Crick, with whom he shared an office, leading to a famous paper on 
      the treatment of errors by Blow and Crick ("The Treatment of Errors in the 
      Isomorphous Replacement Method", 1959). By the end of his PhD work in 
      1957, the foundations of protein crystallography had been laid and the 
      first three-dimensional images of the protein myoglobin had been obtained 
      by John Kendrew and his colleagues. The method has been used to solve the 
      vast majority of new protein structures ever since.</P>
      <P>Blow then spent two rather unproductive years as a Fulbright scholar 
      with Alex Rich in the United States, at NIH (the National Institute of 
      Health, Bethesda) and MIT, learning that it was better to work on crystals 
      than fibres. Meanwhile the atomic structure of myoglobin and the 
      three-dimensional structure of haemoglobin were worked out by the group he 
      left behind in Cambrdige. Perutz and Kendrew were to be awarded the 1962 
      Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Blow had become one of the earliest 
      contributors to a revolution in biology based on understanding the 
      structure of proteins and nucleic acids, a field now called structural 
      molecular biology or biophysics.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of his American postdoctoral work, influenced by the 
      missionary zeal of his Methodist parents and elder brother, he considered 
      teaching in what is now Zimbabwe. However, surprised and delighted to be 
      offered a post back in the MRC Unit, he immediately agreed to return to 
      Cambridge to work in the rapidly developing field of protein 
      crystallography, and began a remarkable collaboration with another young 
      scientist with whom he shared an office, Michael Rossmann. Their success 
      was due to their completely complementary personalities. Rossmann was 
      tremendously enthusiastic and would go roaring off at the least idea 
      whereas Blow would reflect, thinking about it more analytically, and in 
      that way they formed a tremendously effective and very positive working 
      relationship.</P>
      <P>During the next five years, they pioneered "molecular replacement" - 
      the second major approach to solving protein structures. They published a 
      series of classic papers defining the mathematics of rotation and 
      translation functions in the 1960s which laid the foundations of the 
      molecular replacement method. Nowadays, this method can be used to solve a 
      new crystal structure very quickly by using existing knowledge of similar 
      structures to bootstrap to a solution.</P>
      <P>After these initial methodological successes, Blow decided he needed to 
      branch out from simply helping with Perutz's work on haemoglobin. He 
      resolved to tackle the structure determination of another protein and 
      chose a digestive enzyme from the gut, chymotrypsin. Brian Hartley, whom 
      he had met several years before in the nearby Biochemistry Department, had 
      worked on the mechanism of chymotrypsin for years, and had already tried 
      to interest the crystallographers in it. Perutz meanwhile had persuaded 
      MRC to build a new laboratory, on a site now shared with Addenbrooke's NHS 
      Trust, to bring together the Cavendish Unit with another MRC-funded group 
      led by Fred Sanger, and Sanger had recruited Hartley, also fresh from two 
      years in America. As a result, Blow and Hartley found themselves together 
      in what became a long-term association at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular 
      Biology when it was opened by the Queen in 1962.</P>
      <P>There, Blow built up an enthusiastic team including two outstanding 
      colleagues, Brian Matthews and Paul Sigler, who succeeded in determining 
      the atomic structure of chymotrypsin by 1967. It was only the third or 
      fourth protein structure to be determined. Thus, at 36, Blow had helped 
      develop the two methods which form the backbone of protein crystallography 
      and had led the team which solved the structure of chymotrypsin.</P>
      <P>With Hartley and others, he went on to work out the mechanism of action 
      of chymotrypsin and solved the structure of many other enzymes and enzyme 
      complexes initially in Cambridge and later at Imperial College, London, 
      where in 1977 he moved to set up the Biophysics group in the Physics 
      Department.</P>
      <P>In Cambridge and London, he had a strong commitment to teaching and 
      trained many PhD students. This led him first to take up a teaching 
      fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1969, and then a 
      Professorship of Biophysics at Imperial College in 1977, forming a 
      cross-departmental alliance, unusual in universities at that time, with 
      Hartley, who moved to Imperial two years earlier as Professor of 
      Biochemistry.</P>
      <P>Blow's students and colleagues found him to be generous, modest, kind, 
      fair, far-sighted and persuasive. He was especially skilful at matching 
      problems to people. Thus he was in great demand, first as Dean of the 
      Royal College of Science at Imperial College, then to oversee the 
      introduction of teaching assessment. As Head of the Physics Department 
      from 1991, he helped rescue the astronomy group from likely 
extinction.</P>
      <P>He earned many scientific honours, being elected FRS in 1972 aged 40, 
      and winning the CIBA prize of the Biochemical Society, the Charles Léopold 
      Meyer prize of the French Academy and the Wolf Prize for Chemistry, 
      Israel's most prestigious scientific award. These last two were awarded to 
      Blow jointly with David Phillips ("the two Davids") for their work on the 
      structures of the first two enzymes, lysozyme and chymotrypsin.</P>
      <P>After retiring with a serious heart problem in 1994, Blow continued 
      working part-time at Imperial College, writing and ensuring projects he 
      had started were properly concluded. His excellent book <I>Outline of 
      Crystallography for Biologists</I> (2002) displayed his long experience 
      and many contributions to the field. During the last year, whilst coping 
      courageously with lung cancer, he continued to write, producing a 
      biographical memoir of his mentor Perutz (to be published by the Royal 
      Society: he had written his obituary for <I>The Independent </I>in 2002); 
      a prehistory of the British Crystallographic Association that he helped to 
      found in 1982; and even a short novel.</P>
      <P>Many of his colleagues travelled to visit him in Appledore, where he 
      had settled in 1994 with his wife Mavis, returning to his roots in a 
      village his great-grandfather had lived in and where he could enjoy 
      walking and sailing. He and Mavis became enthusiastic members of the local 
      community, Mavis as secretary and euphonium player in the Appledore Brass 
      Band and David as band roadie and architect of a Lottery grant to purchase 
      new brass instruments, and as chairman of the Torridge branch of the 
      Campaign to Protect Rural England.</P>
