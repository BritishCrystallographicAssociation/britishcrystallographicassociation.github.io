              William Cochran<br>
Physicist whose research into DNA and crystals offered fresh insights
</center><br> 
<p>
IN THE 1950s and 1960s the physicist William Cochran did pioneering work on
many of the problems that underpinned Nobel prizes won by others, including
the structure of DNA.</p>

<P>He also worked on so-called 'direct methods'; for determining the
arrangement of atoms in crystal structures and on the interpretation of the
way atoms vibrate in solids. He was responsible for advances in the
theoretical understanding of the way crystalline solids transform from one
structure to another at structural phase transitions.</p>

<P>Bill Cochran was born in 1922 and educated at Boroughmuir High School in
Edinburgh before going to Edinburgh University to read physics. After
graduating in 1943 he decided that his postgraduate studies would be best
pursued in the chemistry department. There he worked with Arnold Beevers on
the crystal structures of organic compounds, as well as fulfilling his
wartime obligations as an air-raid warden. He left Edinburgh in 1948 to go
to Cambridge, where he held a succession of posts until 1964. </p>

<P>During this period he did much of the research work for which he is now
known. His skills in determining the complex crystal structures of organic
molecules led Francis Crick to seek his help in understanding the
diffraction patterns of DNA, and his elegant explanation of the scattering
from a helix was a crucial step in enabling Crick and Watson to determine
the structure of DNA.  </p>

 <P>Around the same time, he made a breakthrough in showing how to ex-ploit
the systematic relationships between the intensitiesone of the very first
truly precise measurements of electron density in a crystal, and wrote, with
Henry Lipson, <I>The Determination of Crystal Structures</I>, the definitive
text for a generation of crystallographers.</p>

<P>His research took a very different turn in 1958-59, when he spent a
sabbatical year with Bert Brockhouse at the laboratories of Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. Brockhouse, who subsequently won a Nobel Prize, had just made
his novel triple-axis spectrometer, which was used to study the crystal
dynamics of solids. This was done using slow neutron scattering, from which
Brockhouse obtained his first data, using a crystal of sodium iodide.
Analysis then revealed that the old model of the crystal dynamics was
inadequate. So Cochran developed a more correct model, in which the outer
shell of the electrons became displaced from the nucleus and the core
electrons. This attracted wide attention, especially when applied to other
alkali halides and to semiconductors.</p>

<P>Further developments led to a new understanding of ferroelectricity in a
crystal &#151; a property now of high interest in a wide range of device
applications. This understanding was later generalised by Cochran and
extended into other fields of physics and chemistry. </p>

<P>In 1964 Cochran was appointed Professor of Physics at Edinburgh
University, and established a new research group in condensed matter
physics. Forty years on, his successes continue to bear fruit and Edinburgh
retains a reputation as a leader in this field. Cochran helped to create the
modern department of physics, and became head of it in 1975. In the decade
up to his retirement he played an increasing role in the university&#146;s
administration, becoming vice-principal from 1984 to 1987. </p>

<P>Cochran was a Fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and
a fellow and then honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Among other
honours, he was awarded the Guthrie Medal by the Institute of Physics, the
Hughes Medal of the Royal Society and the Potts Medal of the Franklin
Institute. A proud Scotsman, he took a keen interest in his family
background, in Scots verse and in the country around his cottage near
Callendar. </p>

<P>He is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1953, and by their son and
two daughters. </p>
