My basic mission would be to serve the Association in promoting research,
education and communication in crystallography. I have been a member of the
BCA from its early days and have watched its membership grow in number and
diversity. I very much believe in maintaining the unique dialogue that has
been established between the four areas of the BCA: indeed since I am a
physicist who researches into industrial chemistry within a crystallography 
department mainly composed of molecular biologists, I am subjected daily to
the full fourfold symmetry of British Crystallography! Two particular
aspirations of mine are to develop further the status of the BCA and its
educational programmes, these having also been causes close to the hearts of
our recent presidents. The BCA still needs to become a more prominent
authority within our peer-review processes which are so important these days
for UK science, and with that to become better placed to exploit new funding
for crystallographic education via smaller course modules and by using
internet methods of communication and delivery. I see these as very worthy
objectives for a 3-year presidency.<br><br>
