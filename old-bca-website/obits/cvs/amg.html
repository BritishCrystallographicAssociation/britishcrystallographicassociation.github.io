My interest in crystals began at the age of seven, when I found my first 
natural mineral! After studying Chemistry at the University of St. 
Andrews, I did my Ph.D. under Dame Kathleen Lonsdale at University 
College London. This was followed by a year as a Postdoctoral Fellow at 
the Chemistry Department at Harvard University. After this I went to the 
Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge to work with Helen Megaw and in so doing 
turned myself into a physicist of sorts. In 1976 I was appointed a 
physics lecturer at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford. My main area of 
research is phase transitions and physical properties of crystals. 
I am General Editor of the 'Journal of Applied Crystallography' and of
'Phase Transitions'.
 A few years ago, I and a colleague invented a new type of low-temperature 
system, and with this we established Oxford Cryosystems.

There are two main areas in which I would like the BCA to become more 
active. One is in representing its members on science funding problems, 
and the other is in attracting more publicity for the field of 
Crystallography.<br>
