<B>Professor George Sheldrick</B> (University of G&ouml;ttingen)
<P>
George Sheldrick's work has for many years embraced structure solution
methods, impinging initially on small molecule structures - the interest
area of the Chemical Crystallography Group.  More recently, George's work,
and that of others in the structure solution field, has moved towards the
application of structure solution in the macromolecular area, hence
impacting on the interest area of the Biological Structures Group.&nbsp; The
program SHELX, developed originally by George while in Cambridge in the
1970s, and subsequently much enhanced and extended, is perhaps the most
widely used piece of crystallographic software world-wide.  There can hardly
be a crystallographer world-wide who has not used one or more of George's
programs.

George has been for many years a regular attender at BCA meetings, and a
regularly invited speaker at these.&nbsp; He delivered the Dorothy Hodgkin
Prize Lecture in 2004, and was awarded the ECA Maz Perutz prize, also last
year in 2004, and has received many other chemical and crystallographic
awards worldwide.&nbsp; He is without doubt one of the UKs most prominent
crystallographic alumni, a Fellow of the Royal Society among many other
recognitions of his distinguished achievements.
