<b>John Helliwell </b><br>
<i>CLCR Director</i>,
      Synchrotron Radiation,
 
    <p>
    Professor J R Helliwell , 49 (d.o.b 19/9/53), obtained his first class
    honours degree in Physics in 1974 from the University of York
    (DSc in Physics 1996). He has a D.Phil in Molecular Biophysics from
    the University of Oxford in 1978, and was a member of Balliol College there.
    He was appointed Professor of Structural Chemistry at the University of Manchester
    in 1989. He formerly held a number of positions at Daresbury Laboratory - Senior,
    then Principal, Scientific Officer at SERC, as well as a Joint Appointment
    with Universities. From January 2002 he is CLRC Director of Synchrotron Radiation
    Science; he is responsible for the science and operations of the Daresbury Synchrotron
    Radiation Source, the first dedicated SR source in the world, and developing CLRC strategy
    for SR in general. He is a Fellow of the Institutes of Physics and Biology and of the
    Royal Society of Chemistry.  He is Editor-in-Chief of Acta Crystallographica
    published by the IUCr, since 1996.  He has been a member of many scientific peer
    review bodies and senior scientific committees in the UK and overseas eg at ESRF,
    ELETTRA and MacCHESS SR facilities and at the ILL neutron facility as well as for the ESS.
    He is Chairman of the International Advisory Committee for the concerted action project on
    “Hydrogen and Hydration in Biology” in Japan. In 2000 he was awarded the Prof K Banerjee
    Centennial Silver Medal at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in
    Calcutta. His principal research involves biological crystallography using SR and neutrons
    to study lectins, enzymes and the crustacyanin carotenoid binding proteins, including
    applying methods that he has made significant contributions to developing in the past
    twenty years such as SR and neutron Laue diffraction and SR anomalous scattering.

 <h2>RESIGNATION OF JOHN HELLIWELL  January 2003</h2>
 
  <P>
  Professor John Helliwell has decided to step down from
  the position of Director, Synchrotron Radiation (SR) at the CCLRC - a post he
  has held since January 2002, on secondment from the University of Manchester.</P>
  <P>John Helliwell has made a crucial contribution to the
  CCLRC and in particular to the programme of the Synchrotron Radiation Source
  (SRS) at the CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory and to SR matters more widely.&nbsp;
  During this period the legal, financial and construction planning stages of
  the new Diamond Light Source have been developed alongside planning for the
  future operation of the SRS.&nbsp; Similarly, the Quinquennial Review of the
  CCLRC - which was published in April 2002 - led to a number of key changes in
  the future operation and development of the CCLRC large-scale research
  facilities.&nbsp; In these areas John has played an important role in
  establishing the new management arrangements in consultation with the research
  communities.&nbsp; John has also laid the foundations for a more extensive
  engagement of the research communities in the future programme for the SRS
  and, again, for wider SR matters.</P>

  <P>The CCLRC will undoubtedly miss the contribution that
  John has made to its programme since January 2002.&nbsp; The CCLRC fully
  understands John Helliwell’s personal wish to return to a full-time research
  position at the University of Manchester - and looks forward to welcoming him
  back in due course as one of the leading UK users of the CCLRC research
  facilities.&nbsp; John Helliwell will return to Manchester University
  immediately.</P>
