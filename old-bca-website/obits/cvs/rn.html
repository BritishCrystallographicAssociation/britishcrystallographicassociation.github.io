<h2>OBE for Richard Nelmes in January 2001</h2>
<P>
Professor Richard Nelmes was awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours. Richard
leads groups from the University of Edinburgh based full time at both ISIS
and the SRS. Over the past decade he and his colleagues have developed many
new techniques and facilities for studying crystal structures and
transitions at very high pressures, using diffraction methods with neutron
and synchrotron beams. They have a particular interest in simple molecular
materials including ice and ammonia (knowledge about these at very high
pressures is of great importance to the modelling of the outer planets and
their satellites - such as Saturn's moon, Titan) and in semiconductors and
elemental metals.

In a collaboration with the University of Paris VI, more than an order of
magnitude increase has been achieved in the pressure range accessible for
neutron diffraction since 1990, breaking through the limits of the previous
20 years. And a series of research grants from EPSRC has funded the
construction and development of a dedicated high-pressure station at ISIS,
making it the leading facility for high-pressure neutron diffraction. In the
early 90s the Edinburgh team at the SRS developed the use of the image-plate
detector for high-pressure X-ray powder diffraction - first pioneered in
Japan - and devised the techniques now used worldwide for detailed
structural studies at very high pressures on synchrotron sources.

Most recently, Richard has led a successful &pound;7 m bid to the Joint
Infrastructure Fund to set up a Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions
(CSEC) based in Edinburgh. This will provide the extensive laboratory-based
facilities needed to make the most of the opportunities provided by modern
neutron and synchrotron sources, and will be particularly effective when
diamond is in operation. CSEC will bring together neutron and synchrotron
facility users in five departments in Edinburgh to tackle a wide range of
extreme conditions science including research into novel materials made at
high pressures and temperatures, the use of pressure to tune and optimise
applied electronic properties, materials and processes for extreme
conditions engineering, Earth and planetary science, high-pressure biology,
and fundamental condensed-matter physics. This unique partnership between a
university-based Centre and the central facilities should make the UK a
world leader in the field.
