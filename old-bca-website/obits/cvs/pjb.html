The recipient of the 2001 ENSA/H&auml;lg Prize will be <strong>Professor
Jane Brown </strong>of the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, in recognition
of her outstanding contributions to the science of neutron scattering over
the last four decades. The prize is to be presented at a special session of
the International Conference on Neutron Scattering, to be held in Munich
between 9-13 September 
</p>
<P>
Professor Brown has made a significant impact upon our understanding of the
fundamental magnetic properties of materials through her contributions to
both the development and exploitation of polarised neutron diffraction and
advanced spherical neutron polarimetry techniques for the precise
determination of complex magnetic structures and spin density distributions.
She has played a key role in developing and establishing a computational
framework, namely the extremely powerful and extensively used Cambridge
Crystallography Subroutine Libraries (CCSL), to facilitate structure
determination from crystalline diffraction. Professor Brown is also very
well known to the European neutron scattering community for the expert
guidance, support and training in single crystal and magnetic diffraction
that she has tirelessly provided at the Institut Laue Langevin over the last
thirty years. 
</p>
<P>
Professor Brown is a graduate of Cambridge University, England. She first
became interested in the application of polarised neutrons in the early
1960s whilst spending two years at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US.
Returning to Cambridge as a senior assistant in research and subsequently
assistant director of research in the Cavendish Laboratory and fellow and
lecturer in Physics at Newnham College she forged close links with Harwell,
where she established a programme in neutron diffraction. In 1972 she was
appointed as Senior Scientist in charge of the Diffraction Group at the
Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble.  She received a Gulbenkian Visiting
Professor Appointment to work at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, in the
early 1990s and has also been a Visiting Professor at Loughborough
University in England for several years. Although formally retiring from the
Institut Laue Langevin in 1995, she continues to run an extremely active
research programme, whilst also remaining a very popular local contact for
user experiments.

The "Physics World" for December 2001 had the following news on page 53.

<strong>
Professor Penelope Jane Brown CPhys MInstP, Loughborough University, wins
the  Guthrie Medal and Prize for her outstanding contribution to the field
of neutron scattering, especially in the area of polarisation phenomena in
scattering processes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Jane Brown is a pioneer in neutron scattering, both
in the development of polarisation techniques in scattering processes and
the application of these techniques to important problems in
condensed-matter physics. The techniques she has developed have been used
for a variety of applications including solving complex magnetic
structures.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Brown's pivotal role in determining magnetisation densities has
improved understanding of bonding and phase transitions in metallic systems,
and has also encouraged several eminent groups to move into this area of
research. In the late 1970s she developed techniques that gave rise to
several seminal papers on the finite temperature properties of itinerant
magnets, as well as inititating similar research at a number of neutron
centres.
</p>
<p>
As a senior scientist at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France,
Brown has guided the development of techniques and instruments as diverse as
multi-detectors for protein crystallography and the CRYOPAD program used for
three-dimensional polarisation analysis. The Cambridge Crystallographic
Subroutine Library developed by Brown over three decades is now used in many
laboratories worldwide and represents a highly flexible and user-friendly
approach to crystallography.
