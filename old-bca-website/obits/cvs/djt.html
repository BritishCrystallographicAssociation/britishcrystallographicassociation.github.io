The Corporate Secretary of the ICDD wrote that:<br><br>
"The Board of Directors of the International Centre for Diffraction Data is
pleased to announce that David J. Taylor of the United Kingdom has been
appointed to the office of Director-at-Large, serving the term 2002-2004.<br>
<br>
Effective immediately, this appointment was made in accordance with the
bylaws, Section 4.7(b), in response to the vacancy in the Director-at-Large
position, formerly held by Ron Jenkins.<br><br>

Endorsed by strong support of the ICDD membership, Dave brings to the Board
extensive experience in XRD and XRF as a senior research scientist in the
glass industry. He took early retirement from Pilkington and is now active
as a consultant in X-ray analysis to industry and academia. He is the
Treasurer and ICDD representative of the British Crystallography Association
and has invaluable experience as an active ICDD member and Regional Co-chair

Congratulations, Dave!"<br><br>


Election Address when Candidate for Treasurer in 2000<br>
<P>
I began my career in the glass industry with Pilkington in 1963, training as
an Analytical Chemist and through day release qualified to attain C Chem
MRSC. My involvement with X-Ray analysis began in 1970 progressing to
Section Head X-Ray Analysis and on to manage a small team of inorganic
analysts. In the early eighties the emphasis of my work shifted into the
crystallography field inheriting an area based on cameras and a PW1050
goniometer with a strip chart. I was responsible for updating the facility
to a fully automated powder diffraction system with an elevated temperature
chamber and more recently into thin film analysis and reflectometry. The
work included characterisation of innovative crystalline coatings on glass
in support of the Pilkington research team. I volunteered to take early
retirement from my position as Senior Research Scientist in April 1998 aged
50. I now do part time consultancy work and am involved with St Helens
College and the development of their analytical service.

<P>
I have been a member of the BCA Industrial Group (IG) committee since 1991
retiring as their Chair in 1998 and am currently the BCA International
Centre for Diffractions Data (ICDD) Representative. I co-ordinated a UK
Instrument Intensity Round Robin exercise for the BCA IG. This gave me an
insight into the performance of many instrument configurations and resulted
in an invitation to present the findings in a workshop at the Denver
Conference in August 1998. I am a member of the International X-ray Analysis
Soc. (IXAS) Steering Committee. I became a member of BCA council at the 1999
AGM and now offer my services as Treasurer to continue the strong tradition
of balancing low membership cost with the provision of high quality
meetings, publications, services and support to students.<BR>
