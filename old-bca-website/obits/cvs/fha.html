The BCA has been fundamental in coalescing and representing UK 
crystallography in a very positive manner.  Part of my job is also to
represent crystallography, through its unique information output, to a very
broad spectrum of scientists worldwide. The strength of the BCA lies in
forging links, and I would want to continue that important process.
