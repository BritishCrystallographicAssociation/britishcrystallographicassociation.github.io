It is both a pleasure and an honour to stand for election as BCA President.
My research is into crystallographic methods, and because of this I feel
equally at home in all the main branches of crystallography and can serve
them on an equal basis. (For example,  I currently hold grants from BBSRC,
EPSRC and industry in Europe, the USA and Japan). In addition, my experience
in organising the IUCr Congress in Glasgow has given me very detailed
insights into the working of the crystallographic community at national and
international level which are of obvious value. The BCA has been, and
continues to be, well served by a long line of active Presidents. I will do
my best to live up to this reputation.
