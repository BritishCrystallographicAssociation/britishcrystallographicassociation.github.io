<P>We learned with great sorrow that Paul Sigler had a heart attack while
walking from home to his lab at Yale on Tuesday January 11th 2000, and died
soon after.<BR>

Paul was an ebullient person, overflowing with enthusiasm, larger than life.
He was gregarious, noisy, and a great conversationalist.  His friends will
remember with a private smile, occasions when Paul's enthusiasm reduced him
to incoherence, not least during his research seminars.  His external
strength and confidence were matched by a capacity for deep and thorough
internal criticism, which led to continuous questioning of experimental
strategies and results.  This combination of public assurance and private
inquisition were crucial in his scientific successes.<BR>

Paul worked in England at the MRC laboratory in Cambridge during the years 
1964-1967, and remained a frequent visitor.

He was my first Ph.D. student, but this was a bit of a joke since he was
almost my age, already had a medical degree, had done crystallography at NIH
as his National Service, and knew far more chemistry than his supervisor. 
We were struggling (along with Barbara Jeffery (now Harris), Brian Matthews
and Richard Henderson) to determine the structure of chymotrypsin. 
 
<P>
In 1967 when we had a structure, Paul and I wanted to know why chymotrypsin
lost activity above pH 8.5.  There were reams of papers about it, but some
were wrong and most were misleading.  I was away for three weeks as we both
wrestled to understand it, and when we met we both had the same answer.  The
key was the stability of a salt bridge - the same salt bridge which cannot
be formed in the zymogen.  We each had the private elation of solving a
difficult problem alone, and then could share that moment with each other.

Paul left Cambridge in 1967 for Chicago University, where he stayed for over
20 years before moving on to Yale.  His chemical and practical ingenuity
brought him many successes.  He described how the stores in his department
had purchased by mistake - in his words - "Avogadro's number of plastic
sandwich boxes", and Paul had recognised them as ideal vessels to carry out
vapour diffusion crystallization experiments.  For a few years (until tissue
culture plates supplanted them) this particular type of plastic sandwich box
was used throughout North America for crystallizations.  In this period,
Paul is particularly remembered for his insightful study of the initiator
tRNA.  Other groundbreaking structure analyses were those of phospholipase
A2, and of the tryptophan repressor and its binding to DNA.

At Yale, surrounded by other active X-ray diffraction groups, Paul entered a
very productive research phase.  As automated intensity measurement lifted
the burden of data collection, Paul's skills in chemistry, biochemistry and
molecular biology led him to make a series of studies of outstanding
biological importance.  He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences
in 1992.  His work on the complex of initiator DNA with its binding protein
and transcription factor resolved many issues about the regulation of gene
expression.  The structure of transducin provides a model for the role of
G-proteins in signal transduction.  His most recent successes were with the
chaperone proteins, which form a 7-fold symmetrical vessel in which proteins
are refolded.  Many will have heard his brilliant talk about the
"two-stroke" mechanism of the chaperone assembly of GroES and GroEL, in
Glasgow last August.  This structure appeared on the cover of the last issue
of Cell in 1999.

Our sympathy goes to Paul's wife Jo, left alone so suddenly, and to his 
five children.
