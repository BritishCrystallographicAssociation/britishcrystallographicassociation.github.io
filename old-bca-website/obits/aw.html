 <h2>Professor Arthur James Cochran Wilson, FRS </h2>
<strong> Arthur Wilson,</strong>
 who ranked amongst the world's leading crystallographers for
almost half a century, died at his home in Cambridge on 1 July 1995, in his
81st year. Arthur James Cochran Wilson was born in Springhill, Nova Scotia
on 28 November 1914 and was educated at King's Collegiate School in Windsor,
Nova Scotia (1922/1930) and at Dalhousie University, Halifax (1930/36),
where he graduated in 1934. It was at Dalhousie that he started his academic
career and in 1936 he obtained an MSc, under the direction of Howard
Bronson, for his work on the heat capacity of Ag, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb as a
function of temperature He then joined Hans Mueller's group at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. where he received his first PhD, in
1938, for a study of the anomalous thermal behaviour of the ferroelectric
Rochelle salt in the temperature range -30 to +30°C. While at MIT he was
awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship which enabled him to go to St John's
College and the Cavendish Laboratory in 1938, the year in which Sir Lawrence
Bragg succeeded Lord Rutherford as the Cavendish Professor of Experimental
Physics at Cambridge, During the remaining two years of his Scholarship,
Wilson made accurate measurements of the thermal expansion of Al and Pb,
which led to the award of his second PhD in 1942. More importantly, perhaps,
it was through his work at the Cavendish Laboratory, and the influence of
Bragg and Henry Lipson, who was effectively in charge of the laboratory
during the war years, that Wilson acquired a life-long interest in X-ray
crystallography. 
<p>
  Wilson's contribution to crystallography while at Cambridge was largely
concerned with three aspects of the subject. His work on thermal expansion
involved the measurement of precise lattice parameters which led naturally
to a general investigation of experimental and other factors which influence
the position, shape and intensity of X-ray diffraction lines, Together with
Alec R.Stokes he also became interested in crystal imperfections through a
study of stacking faults in Co (1941/2) and in the alloy Cu3Au (1943), and a
general treatment of diffraction effects due to small, distorted or
otherwise imperfect crystals followed; his book X-ray Optics (1949; 2nd
edition 1962) has been the starting point for much subsequent research in
this field and is still a definitive work on the subject. These two aspects
of crystallography relate to studies of polycrystalline samples, but the
third and equally significant contribution was concerned with the
determination of structures from single-crystal data. When asked to review a
paper submitted to Nature in 1942 on deriving absolute from relative
intensities of X-ray diffraction data,Wilson first became aware of the
analytic power of crystallographic statistics. The complex method described
in the paper stimulated a simpler, and more direct approach to the problem
which was published alongside the original contribution. The practical
importance of this work was not realised for a while, but Wilson's 1942
paper in Nature eventually became one of the most frequently cited papers in
crystallography and the Wilson Plot is used to this day for scaling
intensities and estimating temperature factors. 
<p>
  Wilson left Cambridge in 1945 to take up an appointment as lecturer in the
Department of Physics at University College, Cardiff. In 1946 he became a
senior lecturer and Director of the Viriamu jones laboratory and then
Professor of Physics and Head of the Department in 1954, a post he held
until 1965. At Cardiff he founded a school of organic crystal chemistry
which rapidly achieved world-wide recognition for its work on alkaloids such
as ephedrine and harmine, on a number of terpenoids (longifolene, etc.) and
on amino acids. Donald Rogers. later Professor of Chemical Crystallography
at Imperial College, and R. Gwyn Howells were associated with the structural
work of the group. Former research students from this period include David
Phillips, now Lord Phillips of Ellesmere, KBE, FRS, Emeritus Professor of
Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford, and former Chairman of the
Advisory Board for the Research Councils. Eric Stanley became Professor of
Physics of the University of New Brunswick, Sukcaki Hosoya was appointed to
a Chair at the Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, and
Ray Hine, Reg Potter and John P.G. Richards, subsequently joined the
lecturing staff in the Department of Physics at Cardiff. The group
contributed substantially to the theory and practice of structure solution;
in particular, Wilson demonstrated, again from statistical considerations,
that the symmetry elements of a crystal structure can be deduced from
observed diffraction data (1949). These include the centre of symmetry,
which had previously been thought impossible to detect by X-ray methods. Sir
Lawrence Bragg said of this discovery 'Like all brilliantly original ideas.
it seems obvious when pointed out' Many of Wilson's derivations of the
statistical properties of weighted reciprocal lattices remain in common use. 
<p>
  Soon after he arrived in Cardiff, Wilson became involved in providing data
for the Powder Diffraction File (PDF), an activity which continued there for
almost 30 years, Although the database and indexes were then published by
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), they were compiled
under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Chemical Analysis by X-ray
Diffraction of the ASTM, the American Crystallographic Society and, in
Britain, the Institute of Physics, through which the Cardiff work was
administered. The Viriamu Jones Laboratory soon became the main centre in
the UK for collecting data for the PDF, in those days by means of a
Debye-Scherrer camera, and for editing data submitted by other laboratories
in Britain. A Research Assistant, Beti E. Lewis, was appointed in September
1947 to undertake this work, Initially under the direction of Wilson. John
W. Hughes supervised the project from 1954 until he and Beti Lewis retired
in September 1975, some five years after the Joint Committee on Powder
Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) had been formed to manage and distribute the
PDF. 
<p>
  Wilson's abiding interest in powder diffraction originated while working
at Cambridge, but prior to that he had developed a life-long friendship with
Bill Parrish when both were post-graduate students with Bertram E. Warren at
MIT. From this association stemmed their joint work on diffractometry;
indeed, Parrish and Wilson were the pioneers of the modem powder
diffractometer, Parrish being responsible for its design and
characterisation, while Wilson developed the theory of diffractometry and
other aspects of powder diffraction. In the late 1940s, after a visit to
Parrish at the Philips Research Laboratory in New York, he brought a device
to Cardiff which may well have become the first counter diffractometer in
the UK. This was a special goniometer developed by Parrish during the War
for routine determination of the orientation of quartz oscillator crystals
and it was adapted by the department's workshop to serve as a rudimentary
powder diffractometer. It wag used by John N. Eastabrook, a postgraduate
student supervised by Hughes, whose thesis, submitted in 1955, was entitled
'Construction and Application of a Geiger-Counter X-ray  Spectrometer'. This
work resulted in the publication during the 1950s of a number of papers on
various aspects of powder diffractometry, the first of many from the Viriamu
]ones Laboratory, Following this early success, Wilson received support from
the Joint Committee to continue development of diffractometry. A commercial
vertical-circle diffractometer, again designed by Parrish, was purchased and
funds were provided for a succession of Research Assistants - E. Roy Pike
(1954/58), later a Fellow of the Royal Society and Clerk Maxwell Professor
of Theoretical Physics at King's College, London, Brian W. Delf (1957/1961);
MBE 1995), who joined the lecturing staff at Cardiff and J. Ian Langford
(1961/66), who subsequently went with Wilson to Birmingham. The first and
last of these were principally concerned with the design and construction of
a system for programmed control of the diffractometer and for the storage of
data on paper tape, the forerunner of the modern Automatic Powder
Diffractometer (APD). This resulted in a dramatic increase in the quantity
of diffraction data obtained, together with an improvement in quality. All
three RAs contributed to the theory and practice of powder diffraction and
to the practical implementation of Wilson's use of statistical concepts for
a precise determination of the positions and breadths of diffraction line
profiles. This work, together with Wilson's own contribution, was published
in the Mathematical Theory of X-ray Diffractometry in 1963, a companion
volume to Parrish's X-ray Analysis Papers (1965). Together with H.P. Rooksby
and H.S. Peiser, he was editor of X-ray Diffraction by Polycrystalline
Materials (1955, revised 1960) and MSc lectures he delivered at Cardiff
formed the basis of Elements of X-ray Crystallography (1970). Thus, over a
period of twenty years and due in no small measure to support received from
the Joint Committee, the Viriamu Jones Laboratory at Cardiff enjoyed a
reputation as one of the principal centres of powder diffraction world-wide.
In recognition of his substantial contribution to this field, and also to
single-crystal diffraction, Wilson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1963, 
<p>
  In addition to pursuing the research activities engendered at Cambridge,
Wilson had a life-long interest in editorial work and his contribution to
presenting and disseminating scientific information is incalculable. In 1948
he became Editor of Structure Reports, a systematic and critical compilation
of crystal-structure determinations and successor to Strukturbericht, the
publication of which had been suspended during the war years. This initiated
a major leadership role in the publication activities of the International
Union of Crystallography (IUCr) which continued without interruption
throughout his life. In 1960 he succeeded Paul Ewald as Editor of Acta
Crstallographica, a post he held until 1977. Acta then the principal
publication of the IUCr, thrived under his editorship, expanding to two
volumes, with a five-fold increase in publications. As editor of Acta, he
was also Chairman of the Commission on Acta Crystallogmphica from 1960 to
1967 and, following the launching of the Journal of Applied Crystallography
in 1968, Chairman of the Commission on Journals. From 1960 to 1977 he was
the first Chairman of the Commirsion on Crystallographic Nomenclature and
subsequently continued to be an active ex officio member. His strong
interests in powder diffraction led to his appointment to the Commission on
Crystallographic Data for many years. In addition to these editorial duties
for the IUCr, he was Associate Editor of the Proceedings of the Royal
Society from 1978 to 1983. He became associated with the ICSU/UNESCO
Committee on Physics Abstracting in 1948 and actively represented the
interests of the IUCr on its successor organisation, the Abstracting Board
of the International Council of Scientific, Unions (ICSU from 1951 to 1984,
This became the International Council for Scientific and Technical
information (ICSTI), on which Wilson served until 1990, as Vice-President
from 1980 to 1986. He was also Vice-President of the IUCr from 1979 to 1981
and was a member of the Executive Committee for many years. 
<p>
  In 1965 Wilson was appointed Professor of Crystallography in the
Department of Physics at the University of Birmingham, where he continued to
pursue his research interests and editorial activities, and few aspects of
crystallography, single-crystal and powder methods, were not covered in the
300 or so papers and other works he published throughout his career. During
his years at Birmingham he was Visiting Professor at the Georgia Institute
of Technology, USA. (1965, 1968 and 1971) and at the University of Tokyo
(1974). He continued to represent the, Institute of Physics on the Joint
Committee until the mid 1980s, regularly attending the Spring and Autumn
meetings in Philadelphia, and in 1984 he received the Distinguished Fellow
Award from the International Centre for Diffraction Data, successor to the
JCPDS. UK representation on the ICDD was subsequently transferred to the
British Crystallographic Association, the link being maintained through the
Association's Industrial Group. Wilson was in fact involved in the formation
of the BCA and became a founder member at the inaugural meeting at Durham
University in 1982. He retired from his post at Birmingham later that year
and was made Emeritus Professor of the University, Dalhousie University
awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1991 and the text of his
address at the conferring Convocation, appropriately entitled Seredipity,
was published in Crystallography News [40, 17-22 (1992)1. He returned to
Cambridge in 1982 and during his retirement he took on the, chairmanship of
the IUCr's Commission on International Tables and was appointed editor of
Volume C. The two series of crystallographic tables published previously had
been widely distributed and were heavily used by crystallographers
world-wide, but were in need of revision, He and Parrish provided much of
the content of Volume C concerned with powder diffraction, as they had for
the earlier Volume II (1959) which it replaced. At the time of his death,
Wilson had in fact been putting the finishing touches to a further revision
of Volume C, A (third edition) and B having appeared in 1992 and 1993.

 Arthur Wilson was a member of the Society of Friends and during his
'retirement' was Clerk of the Jesus Lane Meeting, Cambridge. Despite his
crystallographic commitments, he also found time to become, actively
involved in the Cambridge Branch of the University of the Third Age, an
extra-mural body that arranges meetings and discussions for older people -
an interest he shared with his wife, Harriett. An enthusiast for mountain
walking, he was a life-member of the Rambling Club and a member of the
Alpine Club and the Sierra Club (San Francisco). <p>
