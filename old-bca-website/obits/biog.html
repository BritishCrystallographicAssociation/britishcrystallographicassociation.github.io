<strong>Keith Moffat</strong> is Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology and Director of the Center for Advanced Radiation Sources at The
University of Chicago. He obtained his BSc in Physics from the University
of Edinburgh, where a conversation with William Cochran directed him
towards biophysics. He obtained his PhD from Cambridge University in 1970,
where he studied haemoglobin crystallography with Max Perutz at the MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology. After postdoctoral studies in rapid
reaction kinetics with Quentin Gibson at Cornell University, he held
faculty positions there until 1990. His research interests lie in reaction
mechanisms studied by time-resolved macromolecular crystallography, and in
applications of synchrotron radiation to structural biology.

<strong>Michael Hart</strong> is at present the Chairman of the National
Synchrotron Light  Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. From 1975 to
1977, he was Special  Advisor to the Central Policy Review Staff at the
Cabinet Office, Whitehall,  UK. From 1976 to 1984, he was Wheatstone
Professor and Head of the Physics  Department of King's College, London. He
was Science Programme Coordinator for  the SRS at the SERC Daresbury
Laboratory from 1985 to 1988 and Professor of  Physics at Manchester
University from 1985 to 1993. His research interests are  X-ray physics,
especially X-ray optics.

<strong>B. T. M. Willis</strong> gained an honours degree in Physics from
the University of  Cambridge in 1948 and a PhD from the University of London
in 1951. From 1951  to 1953, he was a member of the research staff of the
General Electric Company,  London, and from 1954 to 1984 a research
scientist at the Atomic Energy  Research Laboratory, Harwell, England. Since
1985, he has been a Senior  Research Fellow at the Chenical Crystallography
Laboratory, University of  Oxford. He is a professorial Fellow of the
University of Wales and has been a  Visiting Professor in Physics in
Denmark, India, Switzerland and Japan. He has published numerous papers on
the theory and practice of neutron scattering,  and has co-authored several
books. Since 1966, he has organized at Harwell,  and later at Oxford,
regular biennial Summer Schools on Neutron Scattering.  His work on behalf
of the International Union of Crystallography includes  being Chaiman of the
Commission on Neutron Diffraction (1984-1987) and  a Co-editor of <it>Acta
Crystallographica</it> (1980-1990).

After studying at Cambridge, UK, <strong>Kenneth Charles Holmes</strong>
 carried out
his doctoral research at Birkbeck College London under the supervision of
Rosalind Franklin on the  structure of tobacco mosaic virus. After a sojourn
in Boston, he returned to  Cambridge to the newly open MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Biology. In 1968, he  moved to Heidelberg to open a new Department
of Biophysics at the Max Planck Institute of Medical Research. He pioneered
the use of synchrotron radiation  as an X-ray source for diffraction
experiments. His laboratory solved the  structure of actin and the actin
filament.

<strong>Jenny Glusker (n&eacute;e Pickworth)</strong> was born in England
and educated at Oxford  University, obtaining a DPhil with Dorothy Hodgkin
as her supervisor. She was  then a postdoc at Caltech working with Corey and
Pauling. After that, she moved  to Philadelphia to work with Lindo Patterson
and has remained there at the  Institute for Cancer Research, where she is a
Senior Member. She has served as  President of the American Crystallographic
Association, and as Chairman of the  US National Committee for
Crystallography and of the IUCr Commission on  Crystallographic Teaching.
She is currently Editor of Acta Cryst. Section D,  has co-authored some
teaching texts and has taught at some of the schools  mentioned in this
article.

<strong>Durward Cruickshank</strong> joined E. G. Cox's chemical
crystallography group at Leeds  University in 1946. He published extensively
in Acta Crystallographica from  1948 onwards on topics in crystal structure
refinement. From 1962 to 1967, he  was Joseph Black Professor of Chemistry
at Glasgow University. In 1967, he  moved to UMIST. Since retirement, he has
helped in the revival of the Laue  method and latterly has been working on
protein structure precision. He was  an Editor of the 1992 IUCr Memorial
Volume for Paul Ewald. He was IUCr  Treasurer 1966-1972 and General
Secretary 1970-1972.

<strong>Professor J. R. Helliwell</strong> BA (Physics, York), DPhil
(Molecular Biophysics,  Oxford), DSc (Physics, York), FInstP, FRSc, FIBiol.
John Helliwell worked at  Daresbury Laboratory's Synchrotron Radiation
Source (SRS) from 1979 to 1993,  whilst also a Joint Appointee with the
Universities of Keele, York and  Manchester, and as a scientific civil
servant, and earlier on the NINA  synchrotron. He has served on the ESRF
Science Advisory Committee as Vice-Chairman and then Chairman, on the ESRF
Machine Advisory Committee, and  on the Council of the ESRF; as Chairman of
the UK SRS Panel for Protein  Crystallography; as Chairman of the Cornell
University MACCHESS Advisory  Committee; as a Member of the Elettra
Sincrotrone Trieste Review Committee;  as a Reviewer of the EMBL Outstation
in Hamburg; on the Advisory Committee  of the Georgia SER-CAT and a
consultant to the Industrial Macromolecular  Crystallography Association's

<strong>Frank Allen</strong> was born in Reading, UK, and is a graduate of
Imperial College  London. Following postdoctoral work at the University of
British Columbia,  Vancouver, he joined the embryo CCDC in 1970, becoming
Deputy Director in 1991  and Scientific Director in 1997. His research
interests are in database design, search and retrieval, and in applications
of crystallographic information in  structural chemistry. He is the current
Editor of Acta Crystallographica  Section B, Vice-President of the British
Crystallographic Association and a  Council Member of the European
Crystallographic Association. He received the  UK Royal Society of Chemistry
Award for Structural Chemistry in 1994. He has interests in education,
travel and sport (now at the observational level  only!).
