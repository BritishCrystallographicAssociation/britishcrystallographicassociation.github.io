<P>Obituary by David Blow

<P>David Chilton Phillips contributed to scientific development at many
levels. He was a physicist with engineering insight, and his first prominent
work was as an instrument designer and operator. Later, his research
revealed the first molecular mechanism for enzyme action, and he was the
prime mover in a reorganization that equipped Oxford University as a leading
force in modern biology. His legendary committee skills were exploited with
devastating effect as chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research
Councils, and he had the task of implementing William Waldegrave's reforms
to the structure of the research councils. In the House of Lords he chaired
the select committee on science and technology, and he is credited with
getting parliament onto the World Wide Web.

<P>David Phillips, the son of a tailor and Methodist local preacher, was
born in Ellesmere, a small town in north Shropshire. He was educated at
Oswestry Grammar School and Cardiff University, although his degree in
"physics, engineering and electrical communications" was interrupted for
three years by service in the navy as a radar officer. He took a PhD in
Cardiff and then worked on crystallography in Ottawa.

<P>When Sir Lawrence Bragg became director of the Royal Institution in 1956
he created a research group to study the crystallography of biological
materials. Among his first recruits were Phillips and Uli Arndt, who set up
equipment for macromolecular crystallography, including a three-circle
diffractometer. John Kendrew, embarking on the almost unthinkable task of
measuring some 10 000 orders of diffraction from each of nine isomorphous
crystals of myoglobin, used this equipment. But diffractometer settings were
made by hand, and their computation was often delayed by breakdowns of the
valve-driven computers.

<P>To get around this problem Phillips and Arndt devised an analogue
instrument to provide the settings, and so convenient was their design that
they were able to build it round a diffractometer. Stepping automatically
along the lines of the reciprocal lattice, this oriented crystal and counter
precisely, so measuring each order of diffraction. The linear diffractometer
was brought into service in time to complete the intensity measurements for
Kendrew's 1959 ground-breaking determination of protein structure at atomic
resolution.

<P>Phillips went on to lead his group in the structural analysis of the
enzyme lysozyme, which breaks down the sugar linkages in cell walls of
certain bacteria. The ability of enzymes to efficiently catalyse a
particular step in a chemical reaction seemed at that time almost magical.
But using his linear diffractometer, Phillips was able to reveal this magic
as a subtle chemical mechanism. In 1965 he unveiled, for the first time, the
structure of an enzyme. He showed how a polysaccharide could bind into a
cleft on the lysozyme surface where a linking bond would be electrically
polarized by charges on the enzyme.

<P>In 1968 Phillips moved to Oxford, where his powerful negotiating skills
came into their own. He recognized that modern biology could only advance in
Oxford by bringing together elements from several departments. He achieved
this collaboration through research council support for the Oxford enzyme
group. Later he brought his molecular biophysics group closer to the other
departments by moving it into the new Rex Richards building.

<P>After a period as biological secretary at the Royal Society, Phillips
became chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils in 1983. His
duty was to represent the scientific research community to government.
Because of Margaret Thatcher's economic rationalizations the exponential
growth of scientific research that had existed since 1945 finally ended, and
universities were under heavy financial pressure to improve efficiency.
Phillips argued successfully that since the nation's financial well being
depended crucially on science and technology, modest growth of the science
budget must continue. But he also had to face the other way and force
universities and research councils to use available resources to greater
effect.

<P>He proposed to direct research support to "research-active" universities,
while other universities concentrated on teaching. I remember him putting
this idea to me before it was widely circulated, and the instant revulsion
and opposition that I expressed. The suggestion was widely opposed and
finally withdrawn, but probably few had pondered the issue as long and hard
as Phillips. Instead, he instituted another system that produced the same
effect by a more subtle and gradual means.

<P>However, Phillips' stern demands for efficient use of research resources
were equalled by the strong face he showed towards government. In committee
Phillips was a master of timing, and he would often allow others to have
their say before destroying them with a few pithy but unanswerable comments.
Tam Dalyell MP says politicians "found him formidable" and quotes a minister
as saying: "I read my brief three times before Phillips enters my office,
and my normally placid civil servants are on tenterhooks." David once
confided to me that what really annoyed him at such meetings was the thought
that everyone else in the room was earning more than twice as much as an
Oxford professor.

<P>Phillips was created a life peer in 1994. He was appointed to the select
committee on science and technology, and became its chairman in 1997, his
health already beginning to fail. When he resigned as chairman late in 1998
Lord Flowers wrote to him congratulating him for presiding over "the most
active session in the committee's history". Under Phillips' chair, the
committee produced nine reports, one of which, said Flowers, "proved too
visionary for the government of the day, but at Phillip's insistence broke
new ground by being published on the Internet". Flowers went on to say that
this precipitated the creation of the home pages for the Lords and Commons,
and thereby contributed significantly to the way parliamentary business will
be conducted and reported in the future.

<P>Lord Phillips died of cancer on 23 February. He was devoted to his family
and listed "talking to children" as one of his interests. He leaves his wife
Diana, his daughter Sarah, and two grandchildren. <br>
