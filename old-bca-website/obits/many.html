structure of hepatitis B virus protein. <br><br>
  <li> Professor George Sheldrick is Professor of Structural Chemistry 
at the University
of Gottingen and Director of the Institute fur Anorganische Chemie,
Gottingen, Germany. He has been a major contributor to the field of chemical
X-ray crystallography for the past three decades and developed the SHELX
computer programs, for structure determination and refinement.

<h2>Queen's <a name="birth01">Birthday</a>
 Honours 2001 Awards to Julia Higgins</h2>
<p>
Congratulations to Professor Julia Higgins OBE FRS, who became Dame
Commander of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in
2001. Julia Higgins is Professor of Polymer Science in Imperial College. She
also chairs the Athena project on women in science, engineering and
technology (SET) in Higher Education in the UK, along with an impressive
list of other responsibilities both to the SET community and for women in
SET.

<h2><a name="jun2000">British</a> Council profiles June 2000</h2>
<p>
The British Council has launched new web pages - a series of profiles of
leading UK women scientists and engineers. The women come from a wide
variety of backgrounds and are intended as role models for girls and women
considering a career in science, engineering and technology.  All are known
for excellence in their field and most are internationally recognised.  Many
are active in encouraging more women to enter the field.</p> 
<p>
Inevitably, the selection of a limited number is subjective and only
scratches the surface of women's contributions to scientific discovery and
engineering excellence.  But it is hoped that these profiles will serve to
encourage greater involvement of leading women scientists in international
events on science. </p>

<h2><a name="frs98">New Fellows</a> of the Royal Society for 1998</h2> 
On 14 May 1998 the Royal Society elected 40 new Fellows and 5 new Foreign 
members. Those of interest to crystallographers are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Harshad Kumar Dharamshi Hansrasj Bhadeshia</strong> Reader in Physical Metallurgy, Dept Materials Science and Metallurgu, University of Cambridge<br>for his work on the theory of solid state phase transformations, 
in particular the prediction and verification of micro-structural development

  <li><em>The Times'</em> on 15 Jan 2001 carried the obituary of 
<strong>William Hewlett</strong> who  was born in Michigan 20 May 1913 and 
died  in California on 12 Jan 2001. Together with his partner,
 David Packard, who died in 1996, he created the firm of Hewlett-Packard,

<h2><a name="23nov00">23 Nov 2000</a></h2>
We are sad to report the recent deaths of two respected colleagues
<ul>
 <li>
It is with great sadness that I announce the death of our friend and
collegue <strong>Peter Verkerk.</strong>
 He died in a motorcyle accident yesterday
evening. (22 November 2000) 
Peter has been a well known and respected member of the
international neutron-scattering community for many years, and will be
remembered as an extremely pleasent and effective scientist. He has
served on countless advisory boards, selection committees etc. where his
scientific and personal qualities were greatly appreciated.
Peter worked at IRI in Delft since 1971. He was responsible for much of
the construction of the rotating crystal spectrometer RKS during the
early seventies, and much of the software for thorough data correction
for TOF spectrometers was then developed by Peter. His ground-breaking
experiments on liquids and compressed gases continued over most of his
career, and it is this which involved him in a large circle of
collaborators. More recently his interests also turned to polymer
electrolytes, where he quickly gained recognition.<br>
                        With deepest regret<br>                                                    Don Kearley, University of Delft<br>

 <li>It is with deep regret that we have to inform you that 
<strong>Harry Brumberger</strong>
passed away on Friday, November 10th, 2000. Harry's contributions to the
small-angle scattering field over many years were of course enormous. He was
one of the founders of the small-angle scattering community both in this
country and abroad. Harry remained active to the end as the SIG's
Member-at-Large, providing much help and wisdom in the organization of this
year's SAS sessions in St. Paul. Tributes of greater length to Harry will
follow. For now, we state simply that he will be greatly missed by all who
practice the art of small-angle scattering, and his family and friends will
be in our thoughts and prayers.<br>

<h2><a name="gc">8</a> June 2000</h2>
<em>The Times</em> of June 8th carried an obituary of 
<strong>Gerry Cookson</strong> (11 Jan 1925 - 4 June 2000 ) a native of
Northumberland, who discovered the structure of porphobilinogen, which is the
chemical building block for  a group of organic pigments, including
haemoglobin and chlorophyll. This was published in <em>Nature</em> in 1953.
He later left academia for industrial vantures such as 
<strong>CamVac</strong>, who exploited
his inventions producing metallic plastic sheets and strips by condeninsf
aluminium on to polymer in a vacuum. This was used not only in consumer
products such as shiny metallic wallpaer and clothing, but also in the electronics industry.
<h2><a name="gh">23 March 99</a></h2>
'The Times' recently published an obituary of <strong>Gerhard
Herzberg</strong> who was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 25th December 1904,
he died in Ottawa, Canada on 3rd March 1999 aged 94. He was a pioneer in the
development of spectroscopy for the study of molecules. He entered the
Technical University at Darmstadt in 1924 to study physics; within 4 years
he had obtained his doctorate. He worked as a postdoc under Max Born and
James Frank in Göttingen and spent a year in Bristol before emigrating to
Canada in 1935. He settled initially in Saskatoon where his classic books
were written, <em>'Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure'</em> published in
1936 and <em>'Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure'</em> published in
1939.


<h2><a name="nk">1 Dec 98</a></h2>
'The Times' published an obituary on 27 Nov 98 of 
<strong>Prof Nicholas Kurti CBE. FRS</strong>
who died on 24 Nov 1998 aged 90. Although not a crystallographer his work on
the production of very low temperatures has led to greater uses of cryogenics
in crystallography. He will probably be best remembered by the general public 
for his interests in science and cooking, and the invention of a <em>Reversed
Baked Alaska'</em> hot on the inside but frozen on the outside.
<h2><a name="jeg"> 25 July 1998</a></h2>
<h2>James Edward Gordon (1913 - 1998)</h2>

<P>
Although Jim Gordon is recognised by many as one of the founders of
materials science he is probably best known for his two books of literary
quality; '<strong><em>The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don't
Fall Through the Floor</em></strong>' was published in 1968 and its sequel
<strong><em>'Structures or Why Things Don't Fall Down'</em></strong>
published in 1978.  In these books he attempted to encapsulate his life's
work on new materials into prose which avoids the fatal flaw of most
technical books, dullness, which was for him an inexcusable sin. The books
were translated into some 20 languages and are still widely used in both
schools and early years of undergraduate courses. 

<P>
During the Second World War he worked on composite materials and later
worked at the Explosives Research and Development Establishment at Waltham
Abbey, where a quest for fibres with a high stiffness to weight ratio led to
the building of a pilot manufacture and processing plant for silicon carbide
whisker crystals. He accepted the chair of materials technology at Reading
University in 1968, where he worked on such diverse problems as the
toughening mechanism in wood and the bursting of blood vessels. This field
is now known as biometrics, where engineers and scientists try to understand
and then mimic natural materials.<br>    <BR>

The November 97 issue of 'Physics World' (page 56) contains an obituary of Reginald 
Gibbs who died on 19 August in his 100th year. He was a world Authority on the
 structure and properties of quartz; he worked with William H.Bragg and was 
associated with University College London for more than 50 years.
