<P>
David Phillips was an outstanding scientist, one of the founding fathers of
structural biology and a wise influential figure in science and government.  
He was Founder President of the British Crystallographic Association
(1982-1984) and the spread of the Association's activities mirrored David's
career in crystallography.   He started with work on intensity statistics,
then moved to small molecule crystallography, followed by protein
crystallography and instrument design.  Protein crystallography led to
proposals for structure/function relationships, homology modelling,
fundamental understanding of thermal motion, and several protein molecules
of pharmaceutical interest such as the immunoglobulin Fc fragment and
<I>beta</I>-lactamase.   However if is for his work with lysozyme that he
will be most widely remembered.   In 1966 he and the team, working at the
Royal Institution in London, solved the first structure of an enzyme,
lysozyme.  From the structure it was immediately possible to put forward
proposals for catalytic activity.   The work opened the way to the explosion
in the numbers of protein structures that are now being determined with
modern technology and for the insights that these structures provide for the
benefit of fundamental research, medicine and agriculture.

<P>
David was awarded a first class war-time degree in Physics, Mathematics and
Electrical Communications (1942-1944; 1947-1948) at University College
Cardiff.  The degree course was interrupted (1944-1947) for service in the
RNVR as a radar officer on HMS <I>Illustrious</I>, a fleet aircraft carrier.  
He remained at Cardiff for his Ph.D. and began work in crystallography under
the supervision of A. J. C. Wilson, the instigator of the "Wilson" plot of
the probability distribution (as a function of
sin<SUP>2</SUP>phi/lambda<SUP>2</SUP>) of X-ray intensities.   He made
contributions to intensity probabilities, the reliability index and solved
the structures of ephedrine hydrochloride, a component of anti-decongestant
nasal drops, and acridine.  After a post doctoral period at the National
Research Laboratories, Ottawa (1951-1955) David was attracted home in 1956
to the Royal Institution of Great Britain in London by Sir Lawrence Bragg.

<P>
Bragg had recently retired from the Professorship of Physics at the
Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge.   There he had presided over the fundamental
studies by John Kendrew on myoglobin and Max Perutz on haemoglobin, the
first protein crystal structures to be solved by X-ray diffraction methods.  
Bragg was keen to set up a protein crystallography laboratory in London.  
Among those whom he attracted, in addition to David, were Colin Blake, Tony
North and Roberto Poljak who came in late 1960 from the US bringing crystals
of lysozyme.   I joined the team in 1962.   Realising that automating the
collection of diffraction data was a prime objective for studies of large
protein molecules, one of David's first tasks was to join Uli Arndt in the
design and construction of an automated diffractometer.  This instrument,
adapted to make multiple simultaneous measurements of intensities, was to
have profound consequences.  With the linear diffractometer David and his
team were able to achieve data of high accuracy that in turn led to precise
structures.   David had participated in the latter stages of work on
myoglobin and in 1961 the linear diffractometer was used to extend the data
of the myoglobin crystals to 1.4 &Aring; resolution, a remarkable precision
in those days.

<P>
Work on lysozyme started seriously in 1961, a time that David described as
the spring of hope.   The work proceeded with intense care in the
measurement of intensities, their corrections for absorption, the
preparation of heavy atom isomorphous derivatives and use of anomalous
scattering.   New data processing methods were developed by Tony North.  The
solution of the 2 &Aring; resolution structure of lysozyme was achieved in
1965, a time for a dual celebration with Bragg's 75th birthday.   The map
was spectacularly clear.   Knowledge of the amino acid sequence, which was
not yet published, allowed a swift and definitive interpretation.  The
structure showed the complete path of the polypeptide chain (129 amino acid
residues) folded into both <I>alpha</I> helices, that had previously been
recognised in myoglobin, and <I>beta</I> sheet, a structure that had been
predicted by Linus Pauling but not hitherto observed in three dimensions.  
The molecule was composed of 2 domains.   Low-resolution (6&Aring;)
inhibitor binding studies, that had begun in 1964, showed that the catalytic
site was located between these 2 domains.

<P>
The inhibitor binding studies were extended to 2 &Aring; resolution by early
1966.   Data collection was laborious; a data set took 14 crystals and
required nearly 3 weeks.   The most informative result was that obtained for
the lysozyme-tri-N-acetylchitotriose complex.   This led to a detailed
interpretation of the lysozyme-inhibitor complex and the key elements of
recognition at the catalytic site.   The next step was to work out how
lysozyme recognised its substrate, part of the polysaccharide component of
the bacterial cell wall.   It was known from the work of John Rupley that
the trisaccharide was a very poor substrate but that catalytic efficiency
increased with chain length up to the hexasaccharide.   By molecular model
building and by a series of logical arguments that brought to bear all the
available biochemical evidence including that on the specificity for
bacterial cell wall substrates with important contributions from Nathan
Sharon, David was able to produce a proposal for the way in which a
hexasaccharide substrate must bind.  With Charles Vernon's insights into
mechanisms of glycoside hydrolysis, it was possible to make proposals for
the catalytic mechanism.  This was the first time that structure had
provided an explanation of how an enzyme speeded up a chemical reaction in
terms of the structural constraints and physical chemical principles.  The
extrapolation from inhibitor binding to the substrate binding was a
remarkable leap of deductive reasoning, achieved in three days.  David
described these three days as the most rewarding that he had ever spent.  
The mechanism was first presented at a Royal Society Discussion meeting held
at the Royal Institution on February 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 1966 and published in
the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1967.  Subsequently the proposed
mechanism has been validated by a host of biochemical and structural
experiments.  For this work and his later achievements in protein
crystallography David was awarded the Feldberg Prize, the CIBA Medal of the
Biochemical Society, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, the Charles
Leopold Meyer Prize of the French Academy of Sciences, the Wolf prize, the
Aminoff medal of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and many honorary
doctorates and fellowships.

<P> Following Bragg's retirement in 1966, David was appointed Professor of
Molecular Biophysics in Oxford University, a move funded by the Medical
Research Council and promoted by Hans Krebs (then Professor of Biochemistry
in Oxford), Dorothy Hodgkin and John Pringle (then Professor of Zoology).  
The Laboratory became part of the Zoology Department where John Pringle had
a vision of Zoology that ran all the way from molecular structures to
populations.   In Oxford there were new achievements in protein structures. 
In an article published in Scientific American (1966), Phillips showed how
knowledge of the lysozyme structure could predict possible folding pathways
that the protein might adopt as it was being synthesised on the ribosome.  
In 1979 with Peter Artymiuk, Colin Blake and Michael Sternberg the
correlation of dynamic properties of lysozyme were reported, an early
example that showed that temperature factors in proteins were more than
simply fudge factors.   In another first early example, he, Tony North and
Wyn Browne used homology modelling to show how a protein distantly related
in amino acid sequence (a-lactalbumin) might adopt the same structure as
lysozyme.   With graduate students (Anne Bloomer, David Banner, Greg Petsko
and Ian Wilson) he solved the structure of glycolytic enzyme, triose
phosphate isomerase.  This was the first example of an 8-fold
<em>alpha/beta</em> barrel protein, a fold that is now recognised as the
most common fold.   He used to say that he felt his scientific contributions
in later years were as an enabler allowing others to flourish.  One of the
happy outcomes of this role was the foundation of the Oxford Enzyme Group in
1968, an association of scientists from many different Departments in Oxford
that met regularly (in the early years with a privately financed dinner) and
promoted interdisciplinary research.  The Oxford Enzyme Group was the
fore-runner of the present day Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences.

<P>
David was elected to the Royal Society in 1967.  From about the mid-70s he
began his second career as an influential figure in the administration of
science. From 1976-1983 he was Biological Secretary and Vice President at
the Royal Society and during this time was instrumental in introducing the
Royal Society University Research Fellowships, a scheme that has done much
to promote the independent careers of gifted individuals.   In his 1991
Bernal lecture at Birkbeck College, David put forward his view that
scientific research must be organised so that "combined with the provision
of the necessary infrastructure, it can release individual scientists to
display their critically important gifts of spontaneity and originality".  
These were his goals when from 1983-1993 he was Chairman (first part-time
and then full-time) of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC),
the then intermediary body between government and the research councils set
up to "advise the Secretary of State on the resource needs of the Research
Councils, the Royal Society and the Fellowship of Engineering".   He also
served as member on the Advisory Council for Science and Technology (ACOST)
and other Advisory Councils.  His skills in committee were characterised by
honesty, considerable oratory and a gift for friendships.   It is said that
politicians were much in awe of him and were fearful of making some
scientific mistake.   He made a special plea for openness in the decision
making process and in the decisions taken.

<P>
His time at ABRC was not without controversy.   On the one hand he needed to
satisfy the increasing demands for funding from scientists faced with the
continuing growth of scientific opportunities, the increasing need for more
and more complex apparatus and facilities (often achievable only through
international collaboration); the growing importance of interdisciplinary
science, and the need for a variety of different organisations within which
research can be conducted most effectively.  On the other hand he fought to
persuade Government to deliver more money but recognising the necessarily
limited resources and pressures for concentration.   He won the respect of
both sides, emphasising that only the best science should be funded,
although some of his views on choices, selectivity and priorities, were not
generally accepted.   As recounted to Max Blythe at the Oxford Centre for
Twentieth Century Medical Biography, he was once reprimanded by the Minister
for making a public statement concerning his view of the poor treatment of
the science budget in the annual government statement on Public Expenditure.  
The Minister conceded in private that the qualities required in a person in
the advisory role on visionary uses of science resources would probably not
be compatible with a person who would be willing to be snaffled and they
came to a good understanding.  The next year the Public Expenditure
statement produced a much better settlement for science that recognised the
need for a rising profile over future years.

<P>
David was made Knight Batchelor in 1979, Knight Commander, Order of the
British Empire (KBE) in 1989 and appointed in 1994 to a Life Peerage as
Baron Phillips of Ellesmere  (his birthplace).  He sat on the cross benches
in the House of Lords, although his views were left of centre.  His
grandfather had been one of the first trade union MPs.   He joined the House
of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology and became Chairman in
1997 contributing especially to a study of the information society and the
needs of the UK and initiating important reviews, such as the Report on
Resistance to Antibiotics.

<P>
In the last years of his life he was ill with cancer but took a keen
scientific interest in the treatment that held the disease at bay for a
considerable time.  He died in the early hours of 23<SUP>rd</SUP> February
1999.   Before he died, he completed the final draft of a manuscript on how
the lysozyme molecule was solved.  It is a fitting tribute, assembled with
historical accuracy and vision and containing much that is instructive to
modern day protein crystallographers.   He once listed among his interests
"talking to children".   He had a simplicity and directness that was equally
effective with children and with the most august members of his committees.  
Many have commented on his great wisdom and on how they have benefited from
his guidance and support.   He was a special person who moved from academia
to wider aspects of science policy, guided by a strong appreciation of
history.   He is much missed.
