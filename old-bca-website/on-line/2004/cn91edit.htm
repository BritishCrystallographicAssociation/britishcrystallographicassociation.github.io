Much of this issue is concerned with the Spring Meeting in
Loughborough, which is at an impressively good
state of preparation. My particular thanks go
to John Finney for his getting details to me so
promptly and carefully - I hope that you will find the
coverage here makes you want to be there!
<P>
As the President remarks, education is and must always be
a hallmark of our Association. On behalf of Crystallography
News, I am enormously grateful to Kate Crennell for her
unflagging support in picking up educational matters and
letting me know about them. I fervently hope that she
will continue to do so, and, as always, I plead for more
voluntary submissions from you, our readers. You’d be
impressed at how high our publication rate is! Meantime,
one of the features of CN is that we publish accounts
of meetings from our bursars. In so doing, I hope we
are helping them develop their communication skills and
educating all of you as well!
<P>
There has been an absence of comment on Tony
North’s letter in the September issue on the subject of
moving the pointer around on the screen in a Powerpoint
presentation. Here is another call for suggestions. I, for one,
greatly appreciated the feature of the overhead projector
(remember the overhead projector?) that allowed one to
face the audience at all times while emphasising points
on the foil with a simple pencil. Even then, however, there
were some who preferred to wander around with a huge
blackboard pointer to “make a point”. Any ideas?
<P>
The main gathering since the last issue went to press
was the excellent European Crystallographic Meeting in
Budapest. The weather was a little on the damp side, but
it was a good and well-balanced meeting, and there is
certainly a lot to see and eat in Budapest! We have two
accounts in this issue. Immediately after the ECM was
EPDIC, the powder diffraction meeting, in Prague. I have
been promised an account of it for the March issue.
<P>
As I mentioned last time, we are hoping to produce an issue
in the IUCr Newsletter on Crystallography in Britain. (The
current issue has an interesting offering on Russia.) I shall
be coordinating this effort with assistance from John Evans
(PCG), Andrea Hadfield (BSG) , Georgina Rosair (CCG) and
Judith Shackleton (IG). Any of us would be very grateful for
any suggestions as to what should (or should not!) be in it.
<P>
Finally, I’m very grateful to John Bevington and Joan
Halfpenny for their obituary for Sam Small. Sam was one
of the founders of the BCA, and invariably a quiet, friendly
presence at meetings. We miss him.
