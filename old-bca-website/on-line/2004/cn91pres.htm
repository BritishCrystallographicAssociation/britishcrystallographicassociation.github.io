<B>EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION.</B> 
An overused and perhaps tired mantra, but one which
reflects the driving imperative behind the status of the BCA as
an Educational Charity. Of course, we are an
organisation steeped in the delivery of Education;
arguably most of our activities can be regarded as
educational in some sense. It is, however, vital in this
modern world that one not only does, but that one
records and publicises that one does.
<P>
For some time there has arguably been some confusion
within the BCA and its membership of what “Education”
means for our Association. Kate Crennell, for a number of
years BCA Education Officer, worked hard in that position
at delivering on an important part of that remit - what
we have recently termed “early-stage” Education. It is
clear, however, that delivery of our core remit at this point
requires the evolution of a broader approach, underpinned
by a coherent strategy. If one takes a moment to note
down the Educational activities undertaken by the BCA in
the last couple of years: Teaching Schools, Workshops,
teaching-driven sessions at Spring Meetings, Young
Crystallographers’ initiatives, Crystal Growing events,
etc, one arrives, over the full range of levels within the
organisation, at an impressive list. To consolidate this, and
promote the range of activity and to enhance it at all levels,
needs a strategic approach for which the whole of Council,
and the BCA subject groups, must take responsibility.
To help kick off discussions of such a strategy, with the
agreement of Council, I convened a working group on
Education comprising senior members of the community.
The discussions were stimulating, the ideas and
recommendations forward-looking, the conclusion that we
do a lot but could do more; that we are currently not hitting
all of our target audiences.
<P>
In the spirit of coordinating input from all parts of the BCA,
and in developing a long-term strategy for continuing and
enhancing delivery of our core remit, the President must
ultimately be responsible. At its recent meeting, Council
therefore agreed that in developing this strategy, for now I
will be responsible for reporting to Council on educational
issues, with the specific responsibility to develop a future
strategy in this area, and also to draw together, project
and nurture our many current activities at all levels of our
educational delivery.
<P>
To do this will require input from a range of people. From
Kate Crennell, who we thank for her many years on Council
as newsletter editor and latterly as Education Officer, and
who we hope will continue from outside Council to provide
her valuable contributions on early-stage education and
archiving. From the subject groups. From individual
members. And here we come to an appeal for input. How
best to develop an Education strategy for the BCA? What
is needed, what areas do we not currently deal with as
fully as we might? To encourage you, our members, to
engage in this debate, I will note here four possible ways
forward emerging from the working group discussions:
improved Teachers’ resource pages on the web-site,
focused on the curriculum; a sponsored “BCA expert gene
pool” to deliver lectures to undergraduate science societies;
expanded research level teaching content in Spring
Meetings, continued harnessing of input from our “Young
Crystallographers”.
<P>
But there will be more, many more, suggestions. It is
important that we develop this strategy in a timely manner
– your thoughts, input and involvement are most welcome.
As always, e-mails to president@crystallography.org.uk.
Enjoy this issue of Crystallography News, in which you
will find many details of the evolving programme for the
2005 Spring Meeting in Loughborough. Vice-President
John Finney has been working hard with his Programme
Committee to develop this programme. I hope you agree
with me that it looks exciting and tempting. As well as
planning to come along yourself, why not draw this to the
attention to colleagues who would not normally attend our
Spring Meeting?
<P>
Finally, a sombre note. To lose giant Nobel laureates such
as Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins is sad and we mourn
for their passing while also celebrating their achievements
in long and distinguished careers. More shockingly, we
record the sudden death of our colleague Sue Bayliss, at
a tragically young age. An unimaginably sad loss, and one
for which words are inadequate.
