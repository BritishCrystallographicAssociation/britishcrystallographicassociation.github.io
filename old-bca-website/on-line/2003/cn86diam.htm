<P>
<B><I>Gerd Materlik</I></B> welcomed users to the meeting held to inform them on the
Status of the Diamond Project, Phases 1 and 2 of the Beam line selection
process and get feedback on their needs. He reported that Diamond Light Source
Ltd (DLS) now had 60 staff and expected to have 100 by the end of 2003. He
anticipates that the main construction challenge will be the small source size
and maintenance of the floor stability to less than 1 Micrometer during the
time of an experiment.
<P>
<B>Planned Timetable</B>:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>March 2003</I>: Begin enabling works
<P>
<LI><I>May 2003</I>: Pile driving begins to stabilise the machine foundations.
<P>
<LI><I>October 2003</I>: Begin the main building works
<P>
<LI><I>September 2004</I>: Begin machine installation and construction of
Office Block due for completion in <I>August 2005</I>
<P>
<LI>Hope for a beam in the storage ring by <I>January 2006</I>, to start beam line
commissioning in <I>June</I> allowing the first users in <I>January 2007</I>.
</UL>
<P>
Finally he announced that <B><I>Richard Nelmes</I></B> had just been made a Fellow of
the Royal Society in the list of new Fellows for this summer, presented him
with a celebratory bottle of champagne and asked the audience to join him in
offering Richard our congratulations.
<P>
<B><I>Richard Walker</I></B>, Technical Director, then described the status of the
machine and office building. The machine design has a large capacity for
insertion beam line devices with 24 'cells' arranged with a 6 fold symmetry.
They are hoping for an initial beam current of 300mA and eventually hope to
reach 500mA.
<P>
The 3 floor Office building will be linked by a covered bridge over the machine
perimeter road to the machine building. The offices will be a mixture of Open
Plan in the central part with cellular offices on the outside.
<P>
Providing stable ground conditions for the machine is difficult because of the
variation in soil properties across the site and because the underlying rock is
chalk with a seasonal variation of the water table. Only a solution based on
piles will give suitable stability, with a compromise between static and
dynamic parameters. The piles will be unsleeved, with a 600mm disc, 11 metres
deep and 3 meters separation. There will be a void between the ground surface
and the 600mm thick experimental hall floor. The floor under the storage ring
will be 850mm thick.
<P>
A "turnkey" contract will be let for the construction of the injector, a 100Mev
Linac with a maximum frequency of 5Hz. The booster magnets are designed; a
"Call for Tender" for "magnet and vacuum girder assemblies" will be issued
shortly. These will be installed and commissioned by DLS staff.
<P>
There will be 7 insertion devices in Phase 1; a vacuum undulator based on an
ESRF design with gap taper mechanism should allow possible installation of a
smaller side station later. The storage ring air conditioning system is planned
to be similar to the Swiss Light Source with variation of &plusmn;0.5&deg;C.
The temperature of the lower 4m of the experimental Hall will be controlled to
&plusmn;1&deg;C on a given day, with a seasonal variation of 5&deg;C.
<P>
<B><I>Colin Norris</I></B> described the Science Program. 7 beamlines are planned for
development by 2007 in Phase 1; in Phase 2 14 more beamlines should be
available by 2011. The beamlines are grouped in a "Village Philosophy" with
those for "Life Sciences" together and "Surface Science", "Nanostructures" and
"Extreme Conditions" near to "Magnetism and Materials" and other possible
spectroscopy beamlines. During construction each beamline will have 2 Beamline
scientists and a technician; they will collaborate with other laboratories,
sharing the best practice with the SRS at Daresbury, with Soleil and the ESRF
in France and the Swiss Light Source. Beamlines for all possible experiments
will not be provided at Diamond, instead the 3 source scenario outlined in the
original Woolfson report is assumed with separate accelerators offering a range
of complementary energies. For example some facilities will be at Soleil, but
notable absences at the moment for Diamond are: single crystal X-ray
diffraction, small angle scattering, surfaces and interfaces and soft X-rays.
<P>
There will be new experimental opportunities; for example combining synchrotron
radiation and lasers and new communities developing in areas such as materials
processing, pharmaceuticals and engineering.
<P>
They are still working on getting funding for the Phase 2 construction;
meanwhile the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will be discussing 8
proposals tomorrow, (20 May 2003) only 4 of which are likely to be in the final
proposals for Phase 2. The deadline for submission of proposals for further
Beam lines is 1st October 2003.
<P>
<B><I>Jim Naismith</I></B>, St Andrews, spoke on opportunities for the Life
Sciences, highlighting a personal selection of the main activities in the
crystallography of protein complexes. Some structural work gives useful
information on medical conditions, for example, DNA damage signalling is
important in cancer research and insulin signalling will become important in
future as more of our obese population develop diabetes. Other topics include
studies of large assemblies, drug design, chemistry, circular diochroism and
small angle Xray scattering.
<P>
<B><I>John Evans</I></B>, DLS, explained how Diamond features including
brilliance, polarisation and a user friendly control system will be useful to
the physical sciences in materials, environmental science and process problems
in engineering. Catalysis studies are applicable to the development of greener
fuels, pharmaceuticals and artificial fragrances. The beam tunability is
important in modelling <I>in situ</I> catalysis experiments on flowing systems.
He discussed plans for the development of "Research Hotels" to provide each
community of users with space for meetings, laboratories and other specific
equipment for their speciality.
<P>
<B><I>Mike Henderson</I></B>, University of Manchester, discussed details of
the migration of user programmes from the SRS to Diamond just before the
audience adjourned to the Exhibition area for a buffet lunch and Posters. After
lunch users split into 6 groups, each with a leader and a DLS employee as
Secretary to discuss the following questions until tea at 15.30:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Is the current portfolio of beamlines (Year 1 and Year 2) a good match with
the needs of the community?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>If not, what areas should be considered (bearing in mind the proposals for
future beamlines to be considers at the Open SAC meeting on Tuesday 20th May)?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>What steps can be taken to ensure a smooth migration of User programmes
from SRS to Diamond?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>What are the implications for Diamond of the future operations of Soleil
and possibly 4GLS?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>How can Diamond broaden its provision to attract users who are currently
perhaps not aware of the possibilities of synchrotron use?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>How should Diamond keep the user community informed of progress on the
project?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All groups then met together to hear <B><I>Phil Woodruff</I></B>
describe the function of the
Diamond Scientific Advisory Committee, SAC, which was to meet the next day.
Colin Norris then chaired an Open Discussion session with each group reporting
back to the meeting, and in conclusion, he summarised this discussion before
the meeting broke up for more informal chats around the buffet.
