The Seventh International Symposium on Crystallisation in Glasses and Liquids
was held this year at the University of Sheffield, UK. Starting in the United
States in 1960 this is a major conference with a long tradition. With growing
interest in glasses and glass-ceramics science and technology, this conference
focuses on bridging the gap between the scientific understanding of nucleation
and growth in glasses, and the industrial applications of glassceramics. This
truly was an international arena, with representatives from Brazil, Argentina,
Russia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, USA, and many European countries.
<P>
For me this was an opportunity to attend my first major international
conference. I presented my paper in the Crystallisation of Metallic Glasses
session with a talk entitled "The kinetics of crystallisation in
Y<SUB>67</SUB>Fe<SUB>33</SUB>".
In my talk, I explained how by using the Avrami-Johnson- Mehl
equation, we could successfully model the kinetics of phase formation of a
novel Y-Fe phase from amorphous Y<SUB>67</SUB>Fe<SUB>33</SUB>,
studied using real-time neutron diffraction.
<P>
Conference proceeding started with an address from the chairman, Professor
Peter James (University of Sheffield), paying homage to Michael Weinberg
(deceased 30 December 2002). The first paper presentation of the conference
(Michael Weinberg Memorial session) was a lively talk by Professor Edgar
Zanotto (University São Carlos, Brazil) on homogeneous nucleation in
supercooled liquids. Fundamental arguments such as the relevance of
Turnbull's equations and classical nucleation theory were discussed.
<P>
In three packed days, papers were presented in sessions ranging from theory and
modelling, experimental studies, and metallic glasses, to commercial systems
and vitreous waste forms. However, by far the largest contribution came from
the bioceramics and glasses community. Bioceramics, and bioactive materials
applications in medicine and dentistry has gained wide interest over recent
years. It is a subject relevant to everyone as we all benefit from this
research through our hospitals and dental surgeries.
<P>
Dr. David Wood (Dental Institute, University of Leeds) gave the first talk from
this field in which he discussed the crystallisation of barium fluormica based
glassceramics following one and two stage heat treatments. The purpose of this
study was to optimise mechanical properties and machinability of these micas
for dental application (crowns, bridges etc.). Dr. Wood and colleagues used
kinetic neutron diffraction, to observe the formation of mica phases in real
time at the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France. He explained how by
using neutron diffraction they could penetrate the bulk of the sample with data
collection times of 2 to 3 minutes. This allowed them to observe a clear
different in the phases present in the two distinct routes (unseen using XRD).
For their study, this could explain the differences in mechanical properties
observed in the two final products.
<P>
Dr. Robert Hill and Dr. Artemis Stambolis (Imperial College) presented papers
on crystallisation in barium fluorphlogopite glass-ceramics, and
apatite-mullite glass-ceramics respectively. Using magic angle spinning nuclear
magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), Dr. Hill observed a large broad peak in the
<SUP>27</SUP>Al
spectrum that he assigned to four-coordinated aluminium with no five or six
coordinated Al seen (in contrast to other similar materials). Using
<SUP>19</SUP>F MAS-NMR
they were able to detect any fluorine-containing precursor crystal phases, and
from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements during
crystallisation, they detected three particles sizes formed from volume and
surface nucleation. From these studies, they hope to develop machinable
glassceramics from novel materials.
<P>
Jennifer Bibby (University of Manchester) presented her paper on
fluorapatite-mullite coatings. These bioactive coatings are used on bone
implant materials to encourage the fixture of implants in patients, and thus
reduce the post-operative recovery time of patients. She introduced her novel
technique of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of these coatings with sintering
to improve adhesion. It has been possible to coat titanium alloys using EPD
which is cheap and can coat complex geometries.
<P>
From industry, Wolfram Hölland (Ivoclar Vivadent, AG, Lichtenstein) presented
his paper on glass crystallisation in dental materials. His emphasis was on
surface crystallisation in opal leucite glass-ceramics and volume
crystallisation in apatite glassceramics. He highlighted translucency,
opalescence, chemical durability and good mechanical properties as the main
issues in choosing appropriate restorative biomaterials for inlays, veneers,
crowns or bridges. By controlled surface-volume crystallisation of composite
leucite-apatite glassceramics he has shown, using high temperature XRD, that
two different crystal phases can be produced in one material enhancing the
overall properties of the dental material.
<P>
In the last talk of the bioceramics and glasses sessions, Professor Ric van
Noort (University of Sheffield) provided a comprehensive overview of dental
glass-ceramic applications including the development of biocompatible dental
materials; improved dental adhesives; and maxillofacial reconstruction. He
challenged the audience to come up with a "perfect" material that
resolves all the issues in bioceramic development.
<P>
There were many other enjoyable presentations from other fields, such as
Professor Lindsay Greer's (University of Cambridge) paper on multilayered
metallic glasses grown by sputtering and studied by speculative XRD.
<P>
Big names in the glasses industry such as George Beall (Corning), Wolfgand
Panhorst (Schott Glas), and Wolfram Hölland (Ivoclar Vivadent) provided insight
into the main issues in the applications of crystallisation of glasses
technology both in terms of products (kitchenware, dinnerware, telescope
mirrors, dental restoration) and safe waste disposal (nuclear and municipal
wastes).
<P>
All refereed and accepted papers will be published in the Society of
Glass Technology journals, "Physics and Chemistry of Glasses" and
"Glass Technology".
<P>
The wide range of techniques used in the study of crystallisation of glasses
and liquids was very apparent from the diverse papers presented at this
conference. The large number of countries represented at this conference
provided a diverse yet informal atmosphere in which it was possible to discuss
this growing area of research and technology.
<P>
I thoroughly enjoyed my three days in Sheffield attending Crystallisation 2003
and I would like to thank the organisers of the conference for inviting me to
present my paper. I would also like to express my gratitude towards the
Physical Crystallography Group of the Institute of Physics and the British
Crystallographic Association for providing me with a generous bursary, without
which it would not have been possible for me to attend the conference.
