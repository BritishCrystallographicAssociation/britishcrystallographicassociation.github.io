As the President says, it is always a pleasure to start with good news, and
what we can do is to fill out his modest statement about himself. He is now
Regius Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow, occupying a chair with an excellent
crystallographic history, as it was held by both J.M. Robertson and George Sim.
Welcome back to the other end of the Forth and Clyde Canal!

More good news is that the last issue of Crystallography News did not make a
financial deficit. For the time being, we are trying to restrict the central
pages of each issue to 32, and we apologise to those of you who wrote articles
for June which are only appearing now. They do help to complete an issue which
has to be got ready too early to take in much from the major summer meetings.
The ACA has just ended and Durban is still in the future as we go to press.

In the jubilee year of the DNA structure, we have our bit to offer in this
issue, thanks to Kate Crennell. She also points out a recent letter to the
Times (July 30) from Lord May, President of the Royal Society, in which he
suggests that a sculpture based on the DNA structure might be commissioned for
that vacant fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. He continues, "The double
helix structure of the DNA molecule has great aesthetic beauty and could be
incorporated by any of the six short-listed artists into a novel and
eye-catching design. What could be better than to create something that
highlights, and stimulates public interest in, the best of both modern art and
science?" One hopes that the "snakes-and-ladders" design on the
postage stamp will not be used as a starting point!
<P>
In this issue we have put news from the groups into a more clearly defined
single section, which we hope will encourage more cross-fertilisation. In order
to save space &ndash; and discourage copies being mutilated &ndash; application
forms for Group Meetings are not being printed. These are generally
conveniently printed from the Group websites, which are given at the top of
each item. Also a couple of very good reports from Arnold Beevers bursars have
been included.
