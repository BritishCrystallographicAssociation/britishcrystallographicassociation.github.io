This symposium, organised by Ross Angel & David Watkin will have a wide
interest. David Watkin has supplied this summary:

<B>SP.02.01</B>
<I>Crystallographic Software &mdash; a Bleak Future?</I>
<B>David Watkin & Richard Cooper</B>.
<BR>
David Watkin, restricting his comments to the small molecule situation,
tried to foresee developments in this field. He noted that most widely used
programs come from authors in the last half of their expected careers, that
past experience had shown software to fade away rapidly after their
authors' retirement, and that there appeared to be no new young authors in
posts that would enable them to continue to maintain programs. Although George
Sheldrick was more optimistic about the emergence of new programmers, Watkin
was worried that much of the wealth of experience encoded in current programs
would be lost to future programmers because little of it was documented. He
pinned his hope for the future on small molecule developments being made to the
open-sourced structured programming now emerging from the macromolecular
sector.

<B>SP.02.02</B> <I>Government Funded Central Initiatives for Encouraging
Diversity of Freely Available Crystallographic Software; and the Threat of
Crystallographic Software Patents.</I> <B>Lachlan Cranswick</B>.
<BR>
Lachlan Cranswick explained the role and
functioning of the EPSRC funded CCP14 project for Single Crystal and Powder
Diffraction. Before Lachlan's time, this project had sought to maintain
established software on multiple platforms. Developments in the World Wide Web
and the reduced choice of hardware platforms meant that this was no longer
necessary, and under Lachlan's stewardship CCP14 had taken on a role aimed
at raising people's awareness of the available software and exposing the
strong points of different programs. His mission had been to encourage people
to seek out the best tool for each problem, rather than just make do with the
software they were familiar with. His close interaction with users at the many
workshops he has run has enabled him to provide valuable feedback to people
still developing programs.
<P>
The second half of Lachlan's talk was distinctly
worrying. He presented a whole catalogue of cases where ideas that were in
common circulation had been successfully patented, mainly in the USA. The
situation looks as if it will deteriorate further should Europe also introduce
Software Patents.
<P>
<B>SP.02.03</B> <I>Hacker Vulnerability: A Major New Complication in
Crystallographic Computing.</I> <B>Carroll Johnson</B>.
<BR>
Carroll Johnson briefly explained the methods used
by hackers to gain access to private and institutional computers, and what can
be done to minimise the risks of intrusion. He explained that the main risk was
to machines left running on local area networks, especially homegrown networks.
The principal safe guards are to use firewalls, and to run intrusion detection
and logging software. He pointed out the need to verify that backup systems
really would enable one to recover work after a serious hack or system crash.
<P>
<B>SP.02.04</B> <I>Crystallographic Software from the NIST Centre
for Neutron Research.</I> <B>Brian Toby</B>.
<BR>
Brian Toby looked back over 20 years of programming, and lamented
the fact that with each generation, fewer and fewer people are able to write
even the simplest programs. He observed "One thing has not changed: support
for programming efforts remains lacklustre". Brian tried to provide answers
to three questions: What are the software needs within the community? How
should programming efforts be organised? and What are the incentives to make
these goals happen?
<P>
<B>SP.02.05</B> <I>There is No Such Thing as Free Software.</I>
<B>Jim Pflurath, Rigaku/MSC Inc.</B>
<BR>
Jim Pflugrath painted an excellent summary of the history of software
development, the similarities and differences between writing code in
laboratories and in a company, and the mechanisms by which software can be
funded. At the Crystallographic Computing ACA 2003 end of the day, he pointed
out, crystallographic software is generally paid for by the taxpayer, either
through the salaries of university staff, through grants for individual
projects or as part of the purchase of an instrument. The so-called free
software is generally paid for by someone's employer (even if they
don't realise it). In later discussion it emerged that software written at
home in the evenings but related to what is done at work, also generally
belongs to the employer!
<P>
Like Brian Toby, Jim also noted that programming
skills are disappearing amongst scientists, to the point where many will not
even be able to read code with any understanding. He drew parallels between
writing software in a company and in a university. In particular, he noted that
in both environments the programmers are also usually scientists, working in
collaboration with other scientists. One common difference was the measures
taken by companies to ensure some level of quality control and security.
<P>
Looking to the future, he explained that Rigaku/MSC make a point of employing
scientists who can both write code, and teach other programmers the science of
crystallography. 'After all', he said, 'there is more to software
than "push a button"'.
<P>
<B>SP.02.06</B> <I>Crystallographic Computing at Bruker Nonius.</I>
<B>Susan Byram, Bruker Advanced Xray Solutions</B>.
<BR>
Susan Byram showed examples of recent software
products that were the result of collaborations outside of the company, and
explained that interaction with the university community was vital. She took
the opportunity to explain that while Bruker-Nonius did protect their
investment in instrument design with patents, to date they had not patented
software or algorithms. Bruker- Nonius are keenly aware that users or their
funding agencies will not accept the real cost of software development.
"Frequent comments are heard that no funding is available to purchase
software for more than a few hundred dollars, or to support software
upgrades". Her response to the observation that less and less software is
being developed in the public sector was to suggest that grant applications
should contain an amount to cover the real cost of writing innovative software
by commercial or independent developers.
<P>
<B>SP.02.07</B> <I>The CrysAlis Software Suite for Area and
Point Detector Measurements: Open Source Option and User Modifications.</I>
<B>Mathias Meyer, Oxford Diffraction, Poland Sp.</B>
<BR>
Oxford Diffraction is a relatively new player in the field, and so
Mathias Meyer took the opportunity to provide an overview of their software
products, and explain how they hope to encourage active interaction with the
user community. The CrysAlis software is open source, so that users can examine
it and make modifications. The modified code remains local to the user, but is
dynamically linked to the rest of the system as a so-called plug-in. This
mechanism enables enthusiastic users to try out and develop new ideas without
undermining the security of the rest of the code.
<P>
<B>SP.02.08</B> <I>Developing Modern Crystallographic Libraries and
Applications: PHENIX and the Computational Crystallographic Toolbox.</I>
<B>Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve, Nigel Moriarty, Nicholas Sauter & Paul Adams</B>.
<BR>
Paul Adams explained how the need for
rapid innovation in macromolecular software to meet the demands of the
structural genomics efforts required a totally new approach to system
development. The PHENIX project hopes to achieve this through a two-layered
approach. High level applications are written in PYTHON to facilitate rapid and
accurate code development, while the underlying core algorithms are written in
C++, the computational crystallographic toolbox (cctbx). This toolbox is freely
available under an Open Source license with the aim of fostering widespread
collaborations.
