The first step for the crystallographer is often the hunt for a decent single
crystal, and in the macromolecular field, even this is being automated.
<B>Julie Wilson</B> (York) on the <I>Automatic Evaluation of High-Throughput
Crystallisation Trials</I> gave a mathematical approach to finding crystals.
The wells of crystallisation plates were scanned for "interesting objects"
which were evaluated according to the shape of the object's boundary. The
parameters were chosen such that single wellformed crystals gave the best
score, and with each well indexed, the best samples could be traced more
quickly and save the crystallographer's time, eyesight and sanity.
<P>
<B>Marek Brzozowski</B> (York), <I>Low-Cost Alternatives for
Nano-Crystallisations</I>, told us about finding a good robot for handling tiny
amounts of sample in a reproducible way. It was the Mosquito robot that came up
trumps and this was also displayed in the commercial exhibition, for its
ability to prevent evaporation of the sample by using injection with needles,
having disposable tips and a user friendly interface for operation.
<P>
<B>Horst Puschmann</B> (Durham), <I>DIMAS: Seamless Crystallography from Sample
Submission to Archiving of Results</I>, showed us a way of running a large
small molecule lab efficiently by having both queue and file location
management, for easy tracing of data after collection. It's based on an MS
Access database which also acts as a link to regularly used structure solution
and refinement packages, to guide the user through the process for submitting a
sample to a CIF ready for deposition.

<P>
<B>David Rendle</B> (The Forensic Science Service, London), <I>Database Use in
Forensic Analysis</I>, gave a fascinating talk on how powder diffraction
applied to paint and drugs can tell us why scaffolding has paint on it and also
chart trends in drug abuse. We learned that when dealers stole their raw
materials for amphetamine manufacture from pharmacies who had optically active
forms, the chirality was apparent in the resultant drugs. Glucose monohydrate
is used to cut cocaine because its particle size and free-flowing properties
are best at mimicking cocaine. Scaffolding paint contains specific markers so
if a builders' scaffolding gets stolen and is subsequently found, the original
owner can be traced. Materials were identified using pattern recognition
particularly the identification of the three strongest lines (mini-Hanawalt
index) in the powder diffraction pattern. Some of the data were collected on a
Debye Scherrer camera and the photos examined on a light box. The DNA database
was also mentioned as a valuable source of data in the fight against crime,
particularly since most crimes are committed by repeat offenders, as high as
90% for rapists.
<P>
<B>Richard Storey</B> (Pfizer), <I>Automation of Solid Form Screening
Procedures for the Pharmaceutical Industry and How to Avoid the
Bottlenecks</I>: In the development of pharmaceutical products, reducing the
time a product takes to get to the market is crucial. A change in solubility
resulting from a polymorphic change is disastrous perhaps leading to the loss
of patents. The complete understanding of the solid form and how to control the
form made is a cornerstone of pharmaceutical development and manufacture.
Powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy are major tools used for
characterisation along with DSC and HPLC. In the initial stages of screening,
very small quantities are used and inspection is done manually with a hot stage
microscope so not everything is automated. On a larger scale (1g) a polymorph
screening robot is used. Each sample is assigned a reference code and this
follows the sample, scanned by a robot, throughout the screening process so its
history can be traced. High throughput powder XRD was carried out using the
Bruker GADDS system which uses an area detector, thereby reducing the effects
of preferred orientation. Other measurements included birefringence employing a
polarised stage requiring the well plates to be made of stainless steel and
glass for viewing samples. Melting points were also measured and graticules
were employed in the microscope lenses for location of crystals using image
analysis. To make use of all this multi-dimensional information, pattern
recognition was done in collaboration with Chris Gilmore's group in Glasgow
using the polySNAP program bringing together the sample information and powder
pattern. To illustrate the effectiveness of their set up, in one run, all four
predicted polymorphs of a compound were detected.
<P>
<B>Mariette Hellenbrandt</B> (FIZ Karlsruhe), <I>The Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database (ICSD) - Present and Future</I>, gave us some background on
the ICSD, the database which contains structures with at least one nonmetallic
element which now has web interfaces for more user friendly searching.
Constructing queries such as the elements of a compound and the mineral form,
the powder pattern can be displayed and often the structure too. It is an
Oracle database with funding mainly from Germany but also the US and France.
CIF deposition is possible but they are currently working at speeding up the
process of getting CIF information into the Oracle database.

Frank Allen (CCDC) - Highthroughput Crystallography: The Challenge of
Publishing, Storing and Using the Results gave us much food for thought.
Currently the CSD has 452, 445 entries, and yearly 33,000 are added. The
predicted growth pattern of the CSD was made before the arrival of CCD’s.
We all know that the throughput of structures of crystallography labs has
soared so why are the predictions on structures in the CSD made in the 70’s
correct? It should be an underestimate. Although nearly 500,000 structures
sounds a lot, when you come to search for specific fragments for conformational
analysis, there really aren’t that many. We need more datasets. Each and
every valid crystal structure contributes to knowledge and development of areas
such as polymorphism and crystal engineering studies. Frank also made the point
about accountability to the tax payer and funding agency as to what they get
for their money. Perhaps the proviso "all data should be published"
should be included. We all realise that the sheer pressure of time and the
labour-intensive nature of getting structures published is a key reason for
this bottleneck between structures on crystallography lab computers and the
publicly searchable databases. There's also the issue of who "owns"
the structure &ndash;
is it the chemist and/or the crystallographer? Particularly
when a valid but not very exciting chemistry paper gets rejected or the
structure determination is of a compound that the chemist has no interest in.
How do the journals view databases when structures are deposited as private
communications? As primary or secondary source of information? &ndash; does it
constitute publication in their eyes? And what constitutes publication? Could
there be a direct link between lab management systems and the database to ease
and speed up the transfer of crystal data, with data validation done at source.
In this area enCIFer, has been made freely available for the manipulation and
validation of CIF files. Some journals don't employ crystallographic
referees and structures with serious mistakes have been published in
prestigious journals. Sometimes the CSD has been the first referees of
published crystallographic data. The issues of collaboration with chemists,
journals and publication, and academic recognition will continue to be hot
topics.
<P>
<B>Steph Harris</B> (Bristol), <I>Structural Knowledge Base Development for
Metal Complexes</I>, gave us an account of building a molecular geometry
library known as MOGUL, an electronic version of Guy Orpen's database
comprehensive survey of metal ligand distances published in Dalton since 1989.
Access to mean molecular dimensions to hand is essential for accurate
refinement restraints, molecular modelling and for structural validation and
comparison. The distribution of distances for these fragments needs to be
unimodal and sharp, and to do this subdivision of the datasets is necessary
according to metal oxidation state, coordination number and sometimes spin
state. This requires more structures in the database to make effective
subdivision possible. For ligands, a template library is being constructed with
ligands grouped together according to topology, connectivity, stereochemistry
and coordination mode. These groups are also part of a hierarchy ordered
according to how specifically the ligand is defined. Bond types are also being
classified using the bond valency state method.
<P>
<B>Iain Oswald</B> (Edinburgh), <I>Rationalising Co-crystal Formation through
Data Mining</I>: The drive for making non-covalent derivatives, i.e. making
co-crystals of pharmaceuticals, is to be able to alter physical properties
without changing the chemical constituents which could introduce unwanted side
effects. Iain used the example of paracetamol, which has orthorhombic and
monoclinic crystalline forms. The physical properties of the orthorhombic form
are more attractive to the pharmaceutical industry but the monoclinic form is
most prevalent. Yet both forms have very similar hydrogen bonding patterns.
Perhaps different adducts can change the hydrogen bonding pattern and give a
material with industry-friendly physical properties. The packing patterns of
adducts such as dioxane and Nmethyl morpholine were shown and for the weaker
hydrogen bonds the word was “you are the weakest link – goodbye”
when the incoming adduct could make a stronger hydrogen bonding link. Iain also
illustrated use of the CSD relational database CSDsymmetry which can look for
molecular positions in relation to symmetry operators in a space group - such
as whether a solvent molecule is situated on an inversion centre or a two fold
axis or general space. For dioxanes, he found that 59% of those extracted from
the data base sat on a special position and of those over 80% were inversion
centres.

<P>
<B>Sam Motherwell</B> (CCDC), <I>Packing Energy Patterns in CSD for Z' = 2</I>
asked can we predict when Z' &gt; 1?
Can packing energy tell us what polymorphic form we will
get? Not necessarily , it doesn't always follow that the most dense with
the lowest packing energy will be the preferred form. Molecular shape is also a
factor. In fact Van der Waals forces can be stronger in energy terms than
hydrogen bonds yet in packing motifs it is the hydrogen bonds that are often
focussed on. Where compounds exist in polymorphs where Z' = 1 and another
where Z' = 2, there are very small energy differences. It appears that when
Z' = 2 the structure is trying to be in another space group with local
pseudosymmetry between the two crystallographically independent molecules.
Certainly it appears to be more common in some space groups such as P-1 and
P2<SUB>1</SUB>.
Sam showed us a survey of functional groups with respect to the occurrence
of Z' &gt; 1. Primary alcohols are known to have higher incidences of Z' &gt; 1
than average, yet bipyridine species also scored highly. At the other extreme,
sugars with many hydroxy groups are less likely to have Z' = 2.
<P>
<B>Ton Spek</B> (Utrecht), <I>Z' Structures from a Symmetry
and Molecular Geometry Viewpoint</I>, again using the CSD,
Ton extracted about 7000 organometallic and
9000 organic crystal structures where Z' = 2. In some cases the two
independent molecules possessed different conformations, in others they had the
same conformation but were related by symmetry incompatible with the lattice
symmetry. There are also structures where symmetry has been missed, with his
ADDSYM (modified MISSYM) Ton found 466 missed or pseudosymmetric structures out
of the 9000 organic structures. An example of missed symmetry was published in
JACS last year, with just the picture of the structure and the crystallographic
information relegated to the supporting information. Checkcif would have found
this error. The level of crystallographic refereeing is an ongoing issue. Ton
introduced us to NEWSYM which determines the space group from systematic
absences in Fcalc, as extinctions in Fobs may differ from those in Fcalc with
poor data. Poor data and disorder hamper detailed analysis of near symmetry as
much of the crucial information is in the weak reflections.
<P>
<B>Richard Cooper</B> (Oxford), <I>Z' &gt; 1: just a nuisance, or something more
interesting?</I> had also looked at the prevalence of Z' &gt; 1 with respect to
functional groups and temperature of data collection. As yet the low/room
temperature dataset is too small to see a definite trend, with the added
complication that a form stable at a higher temperature may be frozen in at low
temperature, as habitually crystals are flash frozen. When we have two
independent molecules we want to see if there is anything significantly
different between them and now there is a facility (MATCH) in the CRYSTALS
package that enables this and even helps with numbering the structure. As to
how close the fit is between the two independent molecules, and how this is
related to space groups, the root mean square values were lowest in
P2<SUB>1</SUB>/c and
worst in P1. Pseudo-symmetric relationships were found between independent
molecules and whilst pseudo-inversion and two fold axes were found, mirrors
were notable by their absence. More investigations on the differences between
the two molecules involved separating the odd and even data on a compound that
undergoes a second order phase transition so that at 150K there are weak spots
relating to a pseudo translation yet at 250K these spots disappear. Wilson
plots of the odd and even data have different slopes. The even data relate to
the similarities between the structures and the odd data tell us about the
differences.
