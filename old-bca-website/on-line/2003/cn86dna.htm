<FONT SIZE=+2><B>The 50th Anniversary of the Discovery of the Structure of
DNA</B></FONT>

In April 1953 the discovery of the structure of DNA was announced in letters to
<I>Nature</I>. This event has been commemorated by many institutions
world-wide.
<P>
The Institute of Physics published a special section "Physics and DNA"
in <I>Physics World</I> March 2003. The first one is a brief history of
crystallography from the research of the Braggs to that of J.D.Bernal and Max
Perutz in Cambridge culminating in the discovery of the structure of DNA. This
makes an excellent introduction to the subject for today's students of
biological structure who may not be aware of the part played by physicists in
early research. The second article is concerned with the micromechanics of DNA
explaining how advances in manipulating single DNA molecules lead to better
understanding of the mechanisms of repair of the double helix. The third
article discusses how DNA can be used as a building block in the construction
of new nanomaterials. A free single copy of the March 2003 issue of
<I>Physics World</I> can be obtained from Claire Webber, Product manager
magazines, IOP Publishing Ltd, Dirac House, Temple Back, Bristol BS1 6BE,
or by email: <A HREF="mailto:claire.webber@iop.org">claire.webber@iop.org</A>
<P>
The UK Post Office issued a set of 5 commemorative stamps in February, with
cartoon depictions of 5 important research topics which had been worked on
during the last fifty years, as a result of the discovery of the structure. The
Post office designers apparently believe these show typical scientists at work.
Copies of these stamps were displayed on a Poster at the York meeting and
members asked to decide whether their fellow workers on biological structures
resemble these cartoon characters.

Channel 4 has broadcast a series of documentary programs on TV "DNA: The
Story of Life" the first one concerned with the discovery Issued for
postage to Europe. Do you know any structural Biologists who look like this? of
the structure of DNA itself had interviews of the most of the original research
workers who are still living 50 years later.

The one who tragically died young in 1958 was Rosalind Franklin. She is
represented in a new biography by Brenda Maddox, <I>Rosalind Franklin. The
Dark Lady of DNA</I>, published in 2002. It had good reviews and was
serialised on BBC radio 4, but at time when few working scientists would have
opportunity to hear it, 9.45am. On page 61 of the February 2003 issue of
<I>Physics Today</I> there is another article on Rosalind Franklin by Lynn
Elkin which is freely available on their website.
<P>
Other books include <I>50 years of DNA</I> published in association with
<I>Nature</I> in April 2003 ISBN 1-4039-1480 X and a biography of James
Watson <I>Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution</I> ISBN
0-738-203-416. <I>Scientific American</I> April 2003 has a feature article
<I>A Conversation with James D Watson</I> which can be found on their
website.
<P>
I exhibited a Poster at the BCA Annual Meeting in York 2003 and am now making a
page on the BCA Website where I am collecting news of the events, and setting
up links to all the events I know of so far, please look at the Website
and tell me of other publications or events.
