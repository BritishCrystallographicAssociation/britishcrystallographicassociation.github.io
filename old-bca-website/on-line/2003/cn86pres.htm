It is always a pleasure to start a column like this with good news, and my good
news on this occasion is the appointment of four new Honorary Members of the
BCA. This accolade is awarded to distinguished crystallographers who have made
outstanding contributions to crystallographic science and to the BCA. I am
delighted to announce that the four new Honorary BCA Members are David Blow,
Durward Cruickshank, Mike Hart and Judith Howard. Council aim to consider
nominations for Honorary Membership each year; these are welcome at any time
from any member, or from the subject groups. 
<P>
On the subject of nominations, at next year's Spring Meeting in Manchester,
the Hodgkin Prize and Lecture will be awarded and delivered. As announced
elsewhere in this issue, nominations for the Hodgkin Prize are invited. Also at
Manchester, a slot has been earmarked for the Bragg Lecture which we are
delighted to host on behalf of the Bragg Lecture Committee. 
<P>
The Spring Meeting programme itself is coming together, with the Plenary
Session theme in 2004 being "Catalysis: from Metals to Macromolecules"
which I think meets very well the aim of providing a unifying session in which
all strands of interest within the BCA can participate. I am certainly looking
forward to it. One of the most pleasing things for me at the programme
committee meeting was the range of excellent topics proposed &ndash; by no means
all of these could be included in the programme. 
<P>
Of course, with a packed programme in our current model of a 3-day Spring
Meeting, it is impossible to include everything, and we are looking at ways of
increasing the flexibility. The day preceding the SM has occasionally in the
past been used for Workshops (particularly of the hands-on variety), and this
is a trend we can encourage, offering Workshops a more flexible timeframe in
which to operate. We are also looking at ideas for a Young Scientists' day,
so watch out, you young scientists I have spoken to on this subject &ndash; you
have not heard the last from me! 
<P>
As I write this, the summer conference season is in full swing and I am in
Cincinnati at the ACA meeting. It is good to see a strong UK presence here and
hopefully this will also be reflected at the forthcoming ECM-21 in Durban - I
know how hard the locals there have worked to put the meeting together. On the
subject of international meetings, it is good to be able to note that the
contribution made by the BCA towards providing bursaries for the Geneva
(/Jerusalem) IUCr meeting is now back with us as hoped. This fund, provided by
the Glasgow 1999 organisation headed by Chris Gilmore and Judith Howard, is
intended to be an ongoing commitment to provide underpinning support for IUCr
meetings. After currency exchange, the amount we will now be able to offer
Florence 2005 is slightly below the original &pound;25k fund, but we hope it
will still be a substantial aid to that meeting. 
<P>
By the time you read this, the summer will be in the past and we will be
looking forward to the new academic year. From my personal perspective this
means new challenges, as I have taken up a new appointment, based equally
between the University of Glasgow and RAL. After spending much of my career to
date in a Facility environment at ISIS, it will be good now to see things also
from another angle and I am looking forward to it. Contacting me, with comments
you may have about BCA issues, will be much the same as before, but with the
option of getting me at either the Department of Chemistry in Glasgow
(C.C.Wilson@chem.gla.ac.uk) or as before at ISIS (C.C.Wilson@rl.ac.uk). Or of
course, the opportunity of missing me in two places rather than just one!
