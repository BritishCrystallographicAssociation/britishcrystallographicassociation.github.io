The conference was set in the beautiful surroundings of the Villa Olmo, on Lake
Como. The Villa was built in 1797 and was visited by Napoleon Bonaparte in the
same year. Since 1982 the Villa has been the home of the "Alessandro Volta"
Centre of Scientific Culture and has hosted many international events. Lunch
was served daily at the villa, and refreshments were provided in the grounds.
The ballroom served as the lecture room, with magnificent, ornate frescos and
the adjoining equally magnificent rooms were used for the poster sessions.
Unfortunately the formal gardens to the front of the Villa that run to the edge
of the Lake were closed off for renovation work.
<P>
The conference began at 3pm on Saturday the 10th May with a few introductory
words from the organizer Kristina Djinovic-Carugo. This was followed by the
opening lecture "From DNA sequence to Protein Structure" by Terry Brown (UMIST,
UK). The lecture set out the historical road from Mendel's theories to DNA
structure, which was appropriate in this 50th anniversary year. It then
proceeded to genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The talk raised the
disadvantages of these "omics" techniques, referring to them as "stamp
collecting" methods. The speaker pointed out the place that structural
biological crystallography would have in this century and that it would provide
insight into the functions of the gene products. Three talks followed regarding
the expression of recombinant proteins and assessment of their quality. One
talk of interest was that of Imri Sinning (Heidelberg, Germany) who talked
about use of transgenic Drosophila in the expression of membrane proteins,
expressing them in the insect eye. Apparently the freezing of the flies in
liquid nitrogen and a shake and sieve method rapidly purifies the heads of the
flies away from their other components!
<P>
The structure of the spindle checkpoint complex Mad1-Mad2 important in the cell
cycle was reported by Andrea Musacchio (European Institute of Oncology, Milan)
on day one. Wolfgang Baumeister (Max-Planck Inst. Germany) gave the last
lecture of the day describing a different structural approach using electron
tomography to provide 3D images of the cells entire proteome. The day was
brought to a close with a wine reception held at the Villa. The reception was
intended to be outside, but the onset of rain saw it moved to a veranda.
<P>
Day two saw a number of lectures on data collection, structure solution and
refinement. These ranged from talks about how to obtain better data and
maximize "in-house" data collection, improving diffraction quality of crystals
and designing the diffraction experiment. The detector requirements were
discussed along with data processing strategies and measures of quality. The
next session included talks about MAD phasing and maximum likelihood molecular
replacement was discussed by Airlie McCoy (Cambridge, UK) using an imaginary
dice game!
<P>
After lunch at the Villa there was the first of two poster sessions, held in
two more of the Villa's ornately decorated rooms. Some 53 posters were
presented on structural research topics from a diverse array of organisms,
covering enzymes, receptors, signalling proteins, glycoproteins, DNA, complexes
and both NMR and X-Ray methods. The final session of talks for day two were on
software, validation and high resolution structures. Garib Murshudov (York, UK)
talked about the principles of macromolecular refinement and Alwyn Jones
(Uppsala, Sweden) talked about interactive electron density map interpretation
using the program "O", demonstrating some of the new tools available in the
program. Alwyn provided much entertainment in his talk by having an apparent
amazement with the 'slide-changing' abilities of Microsoft PowerPoint! Gerard
Kleywegt (Uppsala, Sweden) discussed the limitations and uncertainties in
experimentally determined structures and ligands and the requirement for
structure factors to be made available for the calculation of the electron
density maps, thereby allowing the viewer/reader to validate the structural
information presented to them. The last lecture of the day by Claude Lecomte
(Vandoevre-les-Nancy) covered ultra high resolution and the possibility of
calculation electrostatic potentials and protein ligand interaction energy.
<P>
The sessions on Monday were dedicated to high through put methods and
techniques. The day opened with a lecture by Dimitrij Frishman (Neuherberg,
Germany) on target selection for high through put projects. He discussed the
ways in which groups had selected a target area and the ways in which this
target area was further reduced by the removal of typically difficult proteins,
such as membrane bound proteins. Par Nordlund (Stockholm, Sweden) followed this
with a talk about strategies for HTP protein production. Valerie Campanacci
(Marseille, France) gave an example of laboratory scale structural genomics,
highlighting the bottlenecks and success rate so far. The major bottleneck is
obtaining high yields of soluble recombinant protein and the success rates so
far appear to be low. The target strategy in this case was to aim for the
"lowhanging" fruit, so one might have hoped for a higher success rate. Jan Lowe
(Cambridge, UK) also talked about the HTP strategy and estimated that each
crystallization experiment cost 10 pence and with around 400,000 experiments
done and only 35 structures solved it is still very expensive with relatively
low success, given the target selection procedures. All of the HTP strategies
appear to use the vapour diffusion method of crystallization and there appear
to be some issues with the success of the dish sealing robots and protein
wastage. Julie Wilson (York, UK) talked of the progress being made at crystal
image recognition and the success she is having and Anne Poupon
(Gif-Sur-Yvette, France) talked about HalX, an electronic lab-book, putting an
emphasis on the importance of recording all negative experimental results
alongside the positive. 
<P>
Victor Larnzin (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) provided a "musical" movie of the
automated beamline equipment as DESY, set to a tune by Shania Twain, with a
finale robotics "dance" to Blur! He also provided statistical trends in the
data collected at DESY in the last year, discussing what they may imply for the
future. On the tunable beamline BW7A only 38% of structures are being solved
within I month and SAD experiments are dominant on this tuneable beamine. There
seems to be a trend towards smaller crystals and larger proteins, with larger
unit cells becoming more common. He also talked about the program BEST being
developed by Gleb Bourenkov and Alexander Popov (Max-Planck, Germany). The
program provides an automated experiment strategy for data collection. Ed
Mitchell (ESRF, Grenoble, France) also provided and insight into the automated
set up at ESRF, discussing the "Fed-Ex" type of experiment already in use by
some industrial users. Gerard Bricogne (Cambridge, UK) and George Sheldrick
(Göttingen, Germany) discussed experimental phase information and how progress
was being made towards dealing with phasing in a HTP world. Anastassis Perrakis
(Amsterdam, Netherlands) provided insight into the program ARP/wARP, towards
automated model building and Udo Heinemann (Berlin, Germany) talked about BESSY
at the Protein Structure Factory in Berlin. He discussed their target strategy,
protein production and automation. Again, success rates seemed low, out of 600
targets only 163 were expressed as soluble proteins and only 115 were in high
yield quantities, giving a success rate at the protein production point of
about 20%. Of the 163 proteins produced to date, only 60 had been purified to
date. David Stuart (Oxford, UK) talked about "SPINE" (structural proteomics in
Europe), again highlighting the difficulties in obtaining soluble recombinant
proteins. The day was closed with a lecture from Eric Hovestreydt (Broker,
Netherlands) about detectors, with particular reference to the use of CCD
detectors with "in-house" X-Ray sources. 
<P>
Tuesday morning began with a lecture from Ulrich Gohlke (London, UK) on the
structural analysis of proteins by transmission electron microscopy and its use
with larger proteins. This talk was followed by Werner Kuehlbrandt (Frankfurt,
Germany) discussing electron microscopy of membrane and transport proteins.
Dimitri Svergun (DEST, Hamburg, Germany) finished the session by talking about
small angle X-Ray scattering and neutron solution scattering, providing shape
information and techniques that can be used to improve the information acquired
by these methods. The rest of the talks for the day were presentations on
structures obtained, which were as varied a selection as the poster session. 
<P>
Day 3 also saw the second poster session where a further 53 posters were
presented. The structure talks were of high quality, providing many insights
into structure function relationships, complex formation and DNA binding.
Almost all of the speakers provided an animation of their protein structures,
with some providing ambitious "morphs", demonstrating domain movements. It
seems that a new "minimum" level of animation had been set for talks! 
<P>
Day 4 saw a continuation of the structure talks. The final lecture came from
Kim Hendrick (EBI, UK) about EBI-MSD (The European Bioinformatics Institute
Macromolecular Structure Database). The emphasis was on the newly developed
search tools on the database and the flexibility this had for users. The
conference was closed with a few words from Phil Evans (Cambridge, UK). He
commented on the previous 6 schools held in the past and on how wet and cold
they had been and that we had been very lucky with the hot weather we had
experienced. He mentioned the crystallography "underworld" who organize these
events, implicating the absent organizer Keith Wilson (York, UK) as the
"Godfather", clearly demonstrated with photographic evidence! After thanking
the organizers, secretariat and support staff he proceed to show some pictures
of the sun-bathing delegates in the grounds of the Villa and, keeping to the
animation standards set, proceeded to show a movie of the diggers in the fenced
off Villa garden, with the promise that a good percentage of the student
delegates get invited back to speak! 
<P>
The conference provided many insights into the future of protein
crystallography and allowed the delegates the opportunity to hear how some of
the new high through put areas are progressing. For the student delegates this
has emphasized the career openings in the field and allowed us to see our own
work in a broader scale. We had the opportunity to put faces to many of the
renowned names in the field and to speak to them. Having met fellow students
from all over Europe, the overwhelming feeling that I came away with was that
we are all equally enthusiastic about the field we have chosen to go into and
that this promises a strong future for biological macromolecular
crystallography in Europe.
