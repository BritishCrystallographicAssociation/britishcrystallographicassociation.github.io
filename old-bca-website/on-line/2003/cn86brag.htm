Although the Nobel Prize won by father and son W.H. and W.L. Bragg in 1915 was
in Physics, Xray crystal structure analysis, which the Braggs founded, has been
enormously influential across a range of sciences from mineralogy to medicine.
During World War 2, WLB played a leading role in setting up the XRay Analysis
Group, a precursor of the BCA and, in 1946, he helped host what was effectively
the zeroth IUCr Congress, followed by a symposium at Leeds, which had four
separate Xray crystallographic groups.
<P>
On 1 July, 2003 (the anniversary of WLB's death), the Royal Society of
Chemistry (RSC) marked the contribution to chemistry of the joint research by
the Braggs 1912-14 at Leeds by making the site a National Historic Chemical
Landmark. At the ceremony, RSC chief executive David Giacherdi noted that the
Braggs' achievement underpinned several other RSC landmarks, including those
for Dorothy Hodgkin at Oxford and for DNA at Leicester and Kings College
London. Conscious of contemporary fears about the survival of University
Chemistry Departments, the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Alan Wilson, reaffirmed Leeds
University's commitment to research in the physical sciences. Memorabilia
selected from the extensive Bragg archives at the Royal Institution were
brought by Dr Frank James to display alongside an original Bragg notebook from
the Leeds period. There were also messages from the RSC president, the
University Chancellor (an unrelated Bragg) and the M.P., Hilary Benn. Derry
Jones produced for participants a pack of short biographies of the Braggs and
historical summaries of their achievements, and also contacted many of the
descendents of WHB and WLB, several of whom have followed successful careers in
science and technology. WLB's daughter Margaret (Lady Heath) unveiled the
RSC plaque in the presence of a chemist grandson of WLB, Dr Charles Bragg,
appropriately (in view of the encouragement both WHB and WLB gave to research
in industry) a Director of R and D. Also represented were the Pippins &ndash;
X-ray crystallographers who had been doctoral candidates in Chemistry at Leeds
in the 1950s under the late Sir Gordon Cox, FRS.

Professor D.W.J. Cruickshank, a former Bragg Lecturer, then gave a fascinating
talk on the Braggs' work on X-rays and crystal structure 1912-15 and its
continuing impact on chemistry over the succeeding 90 years. None of the five
presentations that we have heard previously from DWJC has begun with his
unpacking salt and sugar from supermarket bags or has contained no equations of
greater complexity than <NOBR>n &lambda; = 2 <I>d</I> sin &theta;</NOBR>.
Durward first
explained how the scientific background of each Bragg prepared him for the
crucial creative period at Leeds immediately after they had heard of the
discovery of X-ray diffraction by Friedrich, Knipping and von Laue in 1912. The
father, WHB, only took up original research in Australia at the age of 42 but
had in Adelaide acquired a wealth of experimental experience of radioactivity
and X-rays, research quickly recognised by an FRS in 1907, and in instrumental
expertise (aided by a talented instrument maker). Arriving as Professor in
Leeds in 1909, he was soon involved in controversy about the wave/particle
nature of X-rays and &gamma;-rays. The son, WLB, already at 22 a graduate of
both Adelaide and Cambridge, was to begin research at the Cavendish (in poorly
equipped laboratories) in another field with J.J. Thomson. However, WLB was
aware of the work of W. Barlow, whose celebrated "Size doesn't matter" remark
related to gloves for demonstrating RH and LH objects, and W.J. Pope on
symmetry theory and how crystals might be structured internally (at a time when
crystal data involved interfacial angles from optical goniometry). Following
long-vacation discussions between father and son in Yorkshire, the simplifying
insight of X-ray reflections from crystallographic planes came to WLB (at
Cambridge) later in 1912, while WHB soon initiated X-ray spectroscopy. In the
Christmas vacation and, even more so, in the summer of 1913, father and son
worked "furiously, far into the night" with the ionisation spectrometer
developed by WHB from the ionisation chamber. Many of the structures solved
(and published in the journals) were gathered in the Braggs' book X-Rays
and Crystal Structures, published in 1915, by which time each author was
occupied in noncrystallographic war-work.
<P>
After World War 1, WLB succeeded Rutherford at Manchester to work on inorganic
structures, especially silicates (shortly before WLB's death in 1971, moon
rocks had been shown to possess analogous chains). After a time at UCL, WHB
moved in 1923 to the Royal Institution, where his school tackled mainly organic
structures. Durward pointed out that later in the 20th century Leeds had
continued to have scientific-descendence links with the Braggs. Three of
WHB's young collaborators at the RI in the 1920s, W.T. Astbury, Kathleen
Lonsdale (then Yardley) and E.G. Cox, later made influential contributions to
crystallography at Leeds.
<P>
W.T. Astbury began X-ray studies in Textile Physics at Leeds in 1928,
investigating wool proteins and stretching transitions in wool fibres and
later, in the Department of Biomolecular Structure, obtained, with Bell and
Beighton, early X-ray photographs of DNA. Also, from the 1970s, the Astbury
Department of Biophysics, as it became, was led by Tony North, who, a
generation after Astbury, had worked at the RI under W.L Bragg's
directorship. Durward felt that it was remarkable that WLB, who had determined
the NaCl structure in 1913 was able in 1963 to draw the lysozyme structure
(work to which Tony North contributed) in time for his 75th birthday. The
successive careers of each Bragg at the RI (WLB moved there from Cambridge in
1954) exemplify the interaction between research and teaching of, especially,
the general public and the young.
<P>
Kathleen Lonsdale (who graduated at almost as early an age as WLB and was later
DBE, FRS) spent a productive time (in more than one sense) at Leeds, 1927-29,
establishing the planarity of the benzene ring in the structure of
hexamethylbenzene.
<P>
The third of WLB's young researchers, E.G. Cox (later Sir Gordon, FRS,
Secretary of the ARC) set up at Leeds in 1945 a powerful chemical
crystallography group. Its aims were to utilise 3-dimensional Xray analysis to
measure as accurately as feasible the dimensions of small molecules and to
establish the stereochemistry of inorganic compounds, especially those of
transition metals.
<P>
Finally, Durward referred to the wide ramifications in science of crystal
chemical structures, to which the Braggs laid the foundations in Leeds,
1912-14, to the magnitude of macromolecular structures that can now be solved,
and to the immense contemporary productivity of structures. These all
illustrate what a Swedish postage stamp succinctly credits the Braggs with:
"services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of Xrays". In
celebrating the Braggs, the RSC Landmark recognises what was probably the most
significant work &ndash; whether in science, medicine or the arts &ndash;
ever done
at Leeds University. And WLB remains the youngest ever winner of the Nobel
Prize.
