It is an honour to be writing this, my first column as BCA President. More of
that later, but let me start with a few thoughts on the recent Spring Meeting.
The York meeting was, in my opinion, excellent, coupling a vigorous and full
scientific programme with a great location and organisation. The truncation of
the meeting to under three days made us all work hard, and meant few dull
moments. Indeed, it is a pleasure to record that any complaints heard by me
about the programme were that there was "too much" to be able to attend. A good
problem for our Spring Meeting to have &mdash; congratulations are due to Paul
Fewster and the Programme Committee. 
<P>
It is also a pleasure to note that along with this Crystallography News you
should find enclosed a copy of the inaugural BCA Review Symposium issue of
Crystallography Reviews. Composed of contributions from last year's Spring
Meeting theme "Novel Methods of Phasing", this is the first in what will
hopefully become a regular series. Thanks are due to the Crystallography
Reviews team at Taylor and Francis, to Moreton Moore, and to the sponsors whose
adverts in the issue have enabled us to provide this free to all BCA members.
We look forward to the 2003 Review Symposium issue on "High Throughput Methods
in Crystallography". 
<P>
As I said at the top, it is an honour to be elected as President, and a
daunting task to follow in the footsteps of a series of highly effective and
eminent pastpresidents. It is my intention in my period of office to continue
with the increasing professionalism of the BCA, in particular the recent
progress made under Mike Glazer and Chris Gilmore, exemplified by the seamless
administration of our Association by Northern Networking. Incidentally it is a
pleasure to note that our membership now tops the 1100 mark. I am aware that we
on Council must continue to work together with our membership to maintain the
leading position of the BCA in reflecting the strength of our science in the
UK, and representing UK crystallography in the world-wide community. 
<P>
However, I feel we must also reach out to colleagues in structural science who
do not necessarily regard themselves as "crystallographers", and increasingly
utilise the diversity of our membership's interests to target
crystallographyrelated colleagues and attract them along, if not to membership,
then to attend our meetings. Underpinning this is the Spring Meeting, which we
should continue to develop as the wellestablished annual focus for the whole
Association. The Spring Meeting allows us to assemble together and further
develop our diverse cross-disciplinary scientific programme. In this era of
cross-disciplinarity, the BCA naturally embraces it and can work from this
strong position. However, I would stress that to maintain the vibrancy of our
subject it is important that we continue to evolve. To use the Spring Meeting
as an example, I think it is vital that the topics covered continue to reflect
a mix of general interest and specialist topics. Along with the terrific input
we already have from the subject groups, I would encourage additional input,
for example from Special Interest Groups or colleagues outside the BCA, to
ensure that the scientific content fully reflects the challenges being met by
our subject today. I would like the job of the Spring Meeting Programme
Committee to be a tough one in selecting from lots of excellent session
proposals! 
<P>
I welcome your views and opinions on BCA matters.
