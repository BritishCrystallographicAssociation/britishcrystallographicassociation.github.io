Polymer crystallisation has been studied from both an academic and an
industrial point of view for well over 50 years. It is still an active
field with different schools of thought, surprises turning up and a
general acknowledgement that certain aspects are still not well understood.
Thus the publication of the first volume of the second edition of
Mandlekern's <I>Crystallisation of Polymers</I> is to be welcomed. The first
edition, published in 1964, is now hard to find and obviously needs
updating. The expansion in the field is such that this new edition comes in
three volumes:
<OL>
<LI>Equilibrium Concepts,</LI>
<LI>Kinetics and Mechanisms,</LI>
<LI>Structure, Morphology and Properties.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Only a person like Professor Mandelkern who has worked in this field most
of his life could undertake such a task. He brings together underlying
principles, illustrated by numerous examples and comments on both
theoretical and experimental limitations.
<P>
The first volume makes it clear that although kinetic factors
often dominate the observed structure one must begin with an understanding
of equilibrium concepts. Each chapter starts with an introduction and some
theory progressing into more detail illustrated by examples from the
literature. In the theory sections relationships between different
approaches are explained and the limits of applicability are noted.
Examples are drawn from a comprehensive range of polymers, predominately
synthetic polymers (not just polyolefins as sometimes happens) but
biological polymers such as proteins are also included. On average there
are over 100 references per chapter covering a wide spread of authors and
publications. With many people now relying on electronic literature
searches it is helpful to have older classic references together with more
recent ones.
<P>
The chapter headings describe the scope of this book:
introduction, fusion of homopolymers, polymer-diluent mixtures,
polymer-polymer mixtures, fusion of copolymers, thermodynamic quantities,
fusion of cross-linked polymers, and oriented crystallisation and contractility.
There are useful tables of thermodynamic properties determined by a
variety of dif ferent techniques but it is unfortunate that the
pages containing these large tables are unnumbered. Otherwise the
book is well indexed.
<P>
This (together with the next 2 volumes) will
be an important reference book for scientists and engineers working
in the field of polymer crystallisation.
