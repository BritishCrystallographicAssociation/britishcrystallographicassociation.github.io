The York meeting passed in glorious sunshine, and seemed to be rated a great
success by everyone. A warm welcome in particular to our lively new President!
Reports of many of the sessions at York are included in this issue. As readers
will have noticed, Crystallography News has grown during the past year, and
expenditure has exceeded income. We are thus trying to restrict the size of
each issue slightly. There has been a particularly bumper crop of good
submissions this time, and some of these will appear in the September issue. 
<P>
Our apologies to Georgina Rosair for advertising her article on service
crystallography on the cover of the last issue and then losing it! Unless the
gremlins are particularly clever, it should really be here this time. It was
good to discover that she was not the only person who noticed that it
wasn’t there! 
<P>
We have had several comments about Lachlan Cranswick's article on
intellectual patents, and it certainly seems an issue that won't go away.
As I write this, I tune in from time to time for the latest riposte in the
ongoing exchange between Alan Hewat and Armel Le Bail (and an increasing number
of others) on the Rietveld network over access to databases. It makes stirring
reading, and anyone not connected to <I>rietveld_l@ill.fr</I> 
has been missing an elegant debate! 
<P>
Meantime, intellectual rights issues have touched another of our own ongoing
subjects. "Bars, the boring kind", to use Mike Hart's name for
those annoying little lines we put over numbers, continue to generate mail!
Tony North wrote about a scheme he has for barring numbers, but it seems that
it is hush-hush for the time being, as it is to appear in an article by Tim
Nott in the July issue of Personal Computer, so don't miss that! Hopefully,
after July the technique will be freely available for use without royalty. 
<P>
Crystallography News has a wider readership than we thought! We have received a
communication from Dr Paul Hartal of Montreal about the mention of his article
The Songs of the Double Helix: Symmetry and Lyrical Conceptualism in Kate
Crennell's review of Hargittai and Laurent's Symmetry in last
September's Crystallography News (page 19). Kate and I both apologise for
misspelling his name and for being uncertain about the seriousness of his
concept of "lyrical conceptualism". Readers who wish to know more about
this approach to the relationship between science and art are referred to the
website:
