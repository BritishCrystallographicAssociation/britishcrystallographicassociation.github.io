Dear Sir,
<P>
I wish to declare my affrontation at encountering yet another ostensibly
"scientific" paper in the literature which heralds a new crystal
structure that has "self assembled". I may be out of date, but I
thought that was rather normal behaviour for a crystal? Have these authors
discovered that normal crystals do not self assemble? - that standard, everyday
crystal growth is actually the responsibility of little workmen, with little
hard hats? - that typical crystal growth rates can be explained by the number
of these little workmen who are working versus those that are drinking little
cups of tea, while reading little tabloid newspapers in little wheelbarrows? -
and that size, mosaicity and crystal quality can usually be predicted by
carrying out suitable QA procedures on the workforce? If such be the case, we
can only be grateful to those who have discovered new materials that actually
do behave in the way we had always thought to be normal.
<P>
And don't get me started on all those other unnecessary neologisms, such as:
"nano"; "femto"; "biomaterials"; or "clean energy
source"; with the associated hyperbolic aura marking a half-formed idea in
search of generous funding! In the eyes of the public, we are often considered
lowly enough. Must we allow our meaningless drivel to drag us down further to
the level of charlatans to the eventual degradation of science?
<P>
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Gould,
<P>
I noticed in the June edition of <I>Crystallography News</I> (page 28)
the verbose variation on "<I>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</I>". I
had seen a very similar version before:
<DL><DD>
<I>Scintillate, scintillate, globule aurific,
<BR>
Fain would I fathom thy nature specific,
<BR>
Loftily poised in the ether capacious,
<BR>
Strongly resembling a gem carbonaceous.</I>
</DD></DL>
This was quoted by Robert Barrass in <I>Scientists Must Write</I>
(Chapman and Hall, 1978) as an example against using
unnecessarily long and complicated words when explaining something. He says it
is anonymous. "Aurific" would relate to golden properties, while
"vivific" in your earlier correspondence relates to "enduing life".
<P>
Best regards,
