Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is an extremely important body. It is the only
moon in the solar system to have a significant atmosphere, and this atmosphere
is of considerable interest. It is composed largely of nitrogen with some
methane and traces of other organic molecules, and may mimic that of the early
Earth and provide insight into the origins of life. A much more comprehensive
understanding of Titan's atmosphere and surface are the aims of the Huygens
lander on the Cassini mission due to arrive at Saturn in November 2004.
<P>
Titan is believed to have condensed from a nebula composed of ammonia
monohydrate, methane clathrate hydrate and rock (silicates and iron) at a
temperature of ~120K. The standard model of accretion assumes that during the
early stages, since Titan was small, gravitational heating of material falling
into Titan will have been small and so the rocky and icy components remained
mixed.
<P>
As Titan became larger, gravitational heating became more significant and the
surface temperature increased until the melting temperature of ammonia
monohydrate (~170 K) was reached and the surface melted. Material accreting
after this surface temperature had been reached became differentiated on impact
with the ammonia hydrates melting, the rocky component falling through the
molten layer to form a carapace, and the methane hydrate thermally decomposing
and losing methane to space.
<P>
At the end of accretion, Titan was then composed of an undifferentiated
rock-ice core whose pressure ranged from 2-6 GPa and which contained all of
Titan's methane. Overlying this was a rocky carapace, which was in turn
overlaid by an ammonia water ocean and a crust of ice. After accretion, the
core would have been warmed by radioactive decay until thermal expansion
ruptured the carapace and initiated core overturn. Calculations suggest methane
clathrate hydrate becomes unstable with respect to ice and methane at 1.2 GPa
and so just prior to overturn, all of the methane in the rock-ice core is
assumed to have been in the form of free methane. During core overturn, the icy
components of the core would rise, and the low density of methane implies that
it would rise more rapidly than water and ammonia. This rapid rise would permit
methane to reach the surface of Titan without being reenclatharated in the
ammoniawater ocean.
<P>
The ~5% of methane currently observed in Titan's atmosphere was then
thought to be the remnant of this pulse of methane which reached the surface
early in Titan's history. But this model has problems. The pulse of methane
cannot have been injected directly into the atmosphere because the rate of
removal by photo-dissociation is such that all methane would be lost in a
timescale much shorter than the life of the Solar System. It has instead been
suggested that the atmosphere is being supplied from a methane reservoir either
at or near the surface and ideas like a methaneocean or methane in surface
cracks or pores have been postulated. However, these models are complex and
difficult to reconcile with the observed rotational dynamics of Titan.
Furthermore, the idea of an early methane pulse is based on the calculated or
assumed highpressure behaviour for the icy components since there was until
recently no experimental information on the behaviour of methane hydrate or
ammonia monohydrate along the relevant P-T path.
<P>
The Paris-Edinburgh cell is ideally suited to studies under the conditions
found in Titan. It can easily cover the entire P-T range needed (0-6 GPa,
100-300 K) and its open opposed-anvil geometry makes it possible to load
mixtures that are unstable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, neutron
diffraction is the technique of choice for structural studies of Hbonded ices.
<P>
Five new phases have been identified in the phase diagram of ammonia
monohydrate as determined in our neutron diffraction studies. As expected,
pressure increases the coordination so that in ambient pressure phase I, the
molecules are essentially four-fold co-ordinated whereas in phase VI the
molecules are eight-fold co-ordinated. Fourier transforms of diffraction
patterns, which reveal paircorrelation functions, suggest that the intermediate
phases IV and V (whose structures still remain unknown) have intermediate
coordinations that are more similar to phase VI than phase I. Plausible
densities can only be obtained for phase IV with 8 or 9 formula units in the
unit cell, and 8 formula units per cell gives a density that is almost
continuous with that of phase I, which is inconsistent with evidence from the
phase diagram. Accordingly, the volumes shown for phase IV are for 9 formula
units per cell, and indicate that most of the ~10% increase of density
certainly shown by phase VI happens as a step change from pseudo-four-fold to
pseudo-eightfold on going from phases I to IV at around 3 GPa. This is the
first information on the density of ammonia monohydrate at high pressure and
constrains the density of the ice component of the core prior to overturn.
<P>
From neutron diffraction patterns of methane hydrate collected on increasing
pressure at room temperature, it is found that at ~0.9 GPa, methane clathrate
hydrate transforms to a new form, methane hydrate II (MH-II) and ice VI appears
&mdash; indicating that MH-II is richer in methane than its parent phase.
At ~1.9 GPa, MH-II undergoes a further
transformation to form methane hydrate III
(MH-III) and more free ice appears. MH-III then remains stable up to at least
10 GPa. On decompression these changes are fully reversible and X-ray studies
of hydrogenous methane hydrate reveal essentially the same behaviour. Structure
solution reveals that MH-II appears to adopt the known hexagonal clathrate
structure and has a 3.5:1 water methane ratio. MH-III is a dihydrate with a new
H-bonded network, which is related to that ice Ih.
<P>
Before these (room temperature) conclusions can be applied to Titan, it needs
to be established that the same non-dissociating behaviour is obtained along
the PT path followed by Titan's core. On compression at ~120 K the sample
amorphises and this amorphous form does indeed crystallise when warmed to form
MH-III and ice VII. This implies that the primordial rock ice core at the end
of accretion contained no free methane but instead was composed of MH-III, ice
and ammonia monohydrate. This conclusion has important consequences for models
of Titan. MH-III and ammonia hydrates have similar densities and would have
ascended together after coreoverturn. As the ices ascended and decompressed
MH-III would have transformed back to MH-II and then to the low-pressure
clathrate- I structure, taking water from the ammonia-water component. We thus
estimate that after core overturn and full differentiation the ice mantle of
Titan would contain a layer of methane clathrate-hydrate ~100 kilometers thick
either just below or just above the ammonia-water ocean &mdash; the ocean's
density is not well enough known to determine which. Such a layer is a much
more plausible methane reservoir than an ocean or near surface storage in
cracks and pores. The presence of this layer may also have important
consequences for the thermal history of Titan. Methane clathrate-hydrate has
substantially lower conductivity than ice or ammonia hydrates and has a higher
shear strength. Hence the presence of a layer of methane clathrate hydrate
could strongly alter conductive and convective heat flow within the ice mantle
of Titan. This could have a strong effect on the temperature of the rocky core
&mdash; for example, it may be that the iron in the core is or has been molten,
giving Titan a magnetic field.
<P>
These results move modelling of Titan onto new ground. Our results provide the
first complete information on the density of the icy components of the core
prior to overturn and need to be incorporated into modelling. Similarly the
existence of the clathrate layer within the ice mantle needs to be included in
models of Titan's thermal history after overturn. And new modelling is
needed to explore how this layer may act as a reservoir to supply the
atmosphere with methane. We acknowledge help from D.D.Klug in preparing the
samples of methane hydrate, and assistance from M.Guthrie and S.A.Belmonte with
the experiments. This work is supported by funding from the EPSRC and the
British Council and through access to beamtime and other resources from CLRC.
