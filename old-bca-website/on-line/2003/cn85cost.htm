University administrators are becoming more determined to balance the books in
all areas of university life, so university activities are put under pressure
to be "value for money" and pay their own way. The analytical services
in my department have been asked to come up with a charging scheme for the work
we do. The challenge is to find a system that is fair but not overly complex to
administer. In October, I put out a questionnaire on the BCA Chemical
Crystallography Group website (thanks to Harry Powell for setting it up) and
posted it to the sci-techxstallography news group. In all, I received seven
replies: 4 from the UK and 3 from the US. The questions asked were:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Do you make a charge to research supervisors for crystal structures
obtained by (a) service personnel or (b) amateur operators? If so, what is the
charge? (E.g. How many pounds per structure, pounds per hour etc.)
</LI>
<LI>Where does the money go? (Does it go into general departmental or
university accounts, or is it all kept by the crystallography service?)
</LI>
<LI>How is the crystallography service paid for? (E.g. do you get a grant or
budget from the department or the university to cover costs? Do you use only
the income from service charges? Is it some combination of these?)
</LI>
<LI>What expenditure is permitted (or required) from the income you receive?
Can you say what the situation is for the following types of expenditure:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Salaries of crystallography service personnel - or are these paid by the
university or department?
</LI>
<LI>Consumables - e.g. cryogens, paper, etc
</LI>
<LI>Repairs - in total, or below a certain limit?
</LI>
<LI>Equipment upgrades - is this subject to any annual, or item limit?
</LI>
<LI>Is it restricted to accessories only, or may/must you buy other items too?
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Equipment renewal - i.e. the next new diffractometer.
</LI>
<LI>Any other categories you might have! - e.g. travel and conferences, space
charges, phone or photocopying charges.
</LI>
<LI>Can you retain unspent funds for the next financial year, or is your money
zeroed at the beginning of each year?
</LI>
<LI>What happens to fees or charges received in respect of commercial or
consultancy work?
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The situations in the UK and the US are very different. Many UK respondents
didn't charge for departmental work, but some of these expressed concerns
that they may asked to do so in the future. All UK services were funded to some
degree by their university departments. Those that did not charge for their
work were financed from top slicing of the department budget. All US labs that
responded did charge for work.
<P>
Most UK labs charged a flat rate per sample but one lab divided the charge
according to the amount of work required on the sample. The structural analysis
was divided into three areas: crystal screening, data collection and structure
solution/refinement. The crystal screening charge allowed for 3 samples to be
screened, thereby discouraging poor quality crystals from being submitted, when
better crystals could be obtained by regrowing them. The charge for data
collection covered up to 24 hours. Thereafter it was one unit per 24 hours. If
the structure was solved and refined by the chemist or colleague, even with
major help from service personnel, no charge was made for solution/refinement.
If service personnel did this part as well, the charge was doubled. This system
was the most complex described, yet it was built to encourage students to get
good crystals and to learn to solve and refine their own structures.
<P>
In the US, services which had to be self-sufficient (bar staff salaries)
charged substantially more ($300 per sample), than those with more financial
support from their departments ($150). In both these cases, when the work was
carried out by chemists doing their own crystal structure analysis, there was
no charge. Another US facility charged per hour. There were 2 charges, one for
instrument hire per hour and a second charge for service personnel time per
hour. Therefore, chemists doing their own crystal structure analysis were
charged for instrument use alone.
<P>
University departments paid for salaries in both UK and US cases. Some
personnel were paid for from research grants but none were paid from the
service income. Department accounts paid for repairs and inexpensive
accessories, but large capital investment such as new diffractometers were
bought with money from grants. X-ray tubes were bought from accumulated service
income or from special department funds for repairs and replacements.
<P>
At the end of the financial year, the service accounts were zeroed (usually for
departments who didn't charge) or carried over into the following year, if
there was a surplus which could be accumulated to fund a large purchase.
<P>
Income from commercial work generally went into a service account, but part of
the income was taken by the university or department. Occasionally, some of the
income went directly to the service personnel through their salary.
<P>
Some of these procedures may work well for your lab, others would need to be
adapted. Charging for crystallography in a university department is a balancing
act and many of us would prefer not to have to charge at all but to choose to
do the work on basis of scientific merit rather than income. In the current
climate we may not have a choice.
<P>
Thanks to all those who replied to the questionnaire. If you have not replied
to the questionnaire, and particularly if you have additional comments on
managing an x-ray service, please e-mail me
