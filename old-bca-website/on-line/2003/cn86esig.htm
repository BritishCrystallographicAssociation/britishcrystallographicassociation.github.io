These courses cover the production and uses of other types of radiation used to
determine structure, synchrotron radiation (SR) and neutrons, and may include
some experiments at the accelerator.

Bill Clegg described the course given in August 2002 on page 18 of the March
2003 issue of <I>Crystallography News</I>. He organised it with Bob Cernik
with invaluable assistance with the administration from Alison Mutch of the
Daresbury Laboratory; such help is essential for a smooth running course. They
obtained sponsorship from CCLRC, EPSRC, BBSRC and the EU to allow the students
to attend at reduced cost; the "students" ranged from new postgraduates
to academic and central facilities staff who had little previous experience of
SR. About 30 students came from different countries, mainly in Europe with some
from Canada. They had a week of lectures and seminars at Chester College, then
a "social outing", some safety training and then 3 days of practical
sessions at Daresbury Laboratory where station scientists supervised the
students doing half-day experiments. The school covered basic fundamentals of
SR (theory and operation), scientific techniques which use it and a range of
applications. Informal social activities with the students are essential to
maintain their interest and allow tutors to discover the weaknesses in the
students' formal training. The next course will probably be held in 2004,
details will be available on the Daresbury Web Site.

<B>Training for Neutron Scattering: ISIS Courses, and the Oxford Neutron Theory
School</B>
<P>
Chick Wilson then talked about courses in the techniques of using neutrons in
crystallography. The
<B>Oxford School of Neutron Scattering</B> was established in
1989 by Terry Willis who had worked at Harwell for many years; he still directs
it with help from staff at ISIS and other European Centres. The school is
residential, held in Mansfield College of the University of Oxford; this year
it is from 8th to 18th September. There were a few places left in March so if
you want to attend this year, it may be worth looking at the details on the
website <A HREF="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/Conferences/osns2003/">http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/Conferences/osns2003/</A>
<P>
The course is intended for scientists new to the field of neutron scattering,
it covers the fundamentals of neutron scattering including the concepts of
scattering lengths, techniques and applications at both steady state and pulsed
neutron sources. Some more recent applications to magnetism are included and
students encouraged to give an overview of their own research as part of the
tutorial sessions. A tour of ISIS, the pulsed neutron source at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory, is part of the course, but otherwise this course is
theoretical, consisting of lectures, seminars and social events to relieve the
stress of such an intensive course.
<P>
The theory course is complemented by an <B>ISIS Practical Neutron
Training Course</B>,
organised by Steve Bennington, which lasts 10 days and is given approximately
annually for about 40 students in response to User demand. The last course was
held in January 2003. The course offers "hands on" experience using
beam time at the ISIS neutron source; it begins with a short review of the
basics and then splits into 3 groups for more detailed study. There is a
diffraction option; students get a thorough grounding in single crystal and
powder diffraction methods, or can choose to study liquids or amorphous
diffraction. Details can be found on the ISIS web site, look under the heading
"Training Courses".
<P>
A third "course" is the <B>New Perspectives in Neutron and Muon
Science Meeting</B>, which was inaugurated in 2000 as a satellite to the annual
UK Neutron and Muon Users meeting. This is organised by young research workers
from ISIS, who get experience of running meetings, for Young Researchers
(defined as less than about 35) who present their own research work in a
relaxed and friendly environment, to give them experience of making
presentations and help them gain confidence before presenting their work to
larger meetings. The most recent meeting was held in April 2003. Details of all
these training events can be found starting from the ISIS web site at:
<A HREF="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/">http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/</A>
then look under the headings "Conferences" or "Training Courses".

<P>
John Helliwell gave us a British perspective on the H E R C U L E S training
courses. The most difficult thing about the courses is probably remembering
what the acronym means, <B>H</B>igher <B>E</B>uropean <B>R</B>esearch
<I>C</I>ourse for <B>U</B>sers of <B>L</B>arge <B>E</B>xperimental
<B>S</B>ystems [<I>it has also a similar acronym in french! &mdash; BCA
webmaster</I>]. These courses are based in Grenoble but include a 1 week stay
in Paris to visit the LURE SR Xray Facility and the LLB neutron Facility. They
are rather longer than the British ones, lasting between 6 and 8 weeks. The
most recent was held from March 2 to April 11, 2003 but usually they are held
in February and March when good skiing is possible. The objectives are to
provide multidisciplinary training in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and the
Geosciences, optimize the use of large installations and develop a community of
young European scientists around those installations. There are ~100
participants and about 70 lecturers drawn from across Europe. Funding is
available from the EU for EU applicants.In addition to lectures the course
includes practicals on all instrument types backed up by tutorials.
<P>
The course content is training in the use of neutrons and synchrotron
radiation. There are two parts: Part I, common to all, is basic methods and
instruments (35 hours). There are lectures on basic notions on diffraction,
small angle and diffuse scattering, XRay absorption spectroscopy, inelastic
neutron scattering and X-Ray imaging techniques. Part II is centred around
applications (45 hours), this year there were two parallel sessions each
lasting four weeks with 80 hours of lectures, 40 hours of practicals and
18 hours of tutorials.
<P>
<B>Session A</B> : Physics and Chemistry of Condensed Matter covered
synchrotron radiation, beam parameters and insertion devices, the Interaction
of radiation with matter in both the elastic and inelastic case. Examples
covered included Surfaces, Magnetic layers and multilayers, Vibrational
spectroscopy of interfaces, Solid state and coordination chemistry, Catalysis,
Earth science and Industrial applications
<P>
<B>Session B</B> : Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics Challenges in structural
molecular biology, proteins structure, dynamics of proteins, studies in
solutions and partially ordered systems. Specials topics included
crystallography of viruses and very large macromolecules, time resolved
fluorescence studies, the quest for a high resolution in ribosome structure,
X-ray microscopy, nuclear spin contrast variation studies on macromolecular
complexes, medical imaging with synchrotron radiation, industrial applications
and structural genomics.
<P>
The teaching staff and students come from mostly EU countries, but there is a
mis-match between the large number of UK teaching staff and the very small
number of UK students. One possible reason for this is that this course is very
much longer; post graduates just starting their Ph.Ds find it difficult to get
away for that length of time. With a trend towards a 4 year Ph.D there may be
time in future.

The content of some of the courses have been published - some as Copublication
Éditions de Physique - Springer, others by the Oxford University Press. Details
can be found on the BCA webpages for courses. Information about future HERCULES

There was little time for discussion of these courses at the end of the
Education SIG, but discussion continued over the education posters in the
<B>Poster Session</B> held later that evening, Suggestions for future
educational topics are welcome at any time. Meanwhile please send me news of
further short courses to add to the BCA web site at
