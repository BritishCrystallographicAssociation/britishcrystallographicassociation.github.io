The Ninth Course generally followed the successful format of its predecessors,
but it continues to evolve to reflect developments in single crystal structure
analysis. This year we increased the number of lecturers from four to five,
with Simon Parsons the new recruit. We also had several new members of the
tutoring staff. As in previous years the course was oversubscribed, even with
an extra tutor group this year. This continued high demand shows how highly the
Course is regarded by the crystallographic community both here and overseas.
<P>
The Course is based around lectures interspersed with tutorials in small groups
of eight students: this time we had ten groups, a total of 80 students. The
students came from a wide range of places, fields of study and backgrounds, and
had a similarly wide range of experience of single crystal structure
determination. Many of them were from overseas, including from Portugal,
Denmark, Yugoslavia, France, Armenia, India, Finland and Ireland, and many
other overseas students already working in the UK. This gave the Course its
typically strong international character. All lecturers and tutors are present
for the duration of the Course, and available for informal questions or
discussions: it is common to see tutors devote all or part of their coffee
breaks to helping students with particular problems or queries. The immense
skill, effort and commitment by the group tutors in engendering cooperation and
collaborative working is a distinctive and vital part of the Course and,
judging by student feedback, one of the most appreciated. This time we aimed to
provide more support in the form of late-afternoon surgeries: it was intended
that the lecturers provide these, but they were largely (and very effectively)
used by students working within their own tutor groups.
<P>
The Course began on the first afternoon with some gentle introductions,
including a reminder by David Watkin about some essential mathematics in the
so-called "Matrix Mixer". The Course continued for a further seven days
with one much needed afternoon and evening off: it is intensive for everyone
involved, but particularly for the students and tutors.
<P>
The Course covers all aspects of structure determination, including fundamental
concepts of symmetry, diffraction, Fourier synthesis, direct methods,
leastsquares refinement and their application to solving and interpreting
structures. The more practical aspects covered in lectures included topics such
as crystal growth techniques, data collection, structure solution, refinement
techniques and structural interpretation. The Course finished with two lectures
given by staff of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre: Owen Johnson on
their new CIF editor, enCIFer, and Lucy Purkis on Mogul, the new
knowledge-based library of intramolecular geometries derived from the CSD.
<P>
The evenings were given over not only to the Matrix Mixer, but also to sessions
on crystallisation, a (partly crystallographic) bar quiz, an expert panel and
student presentations. In the last of these, each tutorial group worked to
produce a science-based presentation, i.e. a "performance" of spoken
word, singing or actions and these were all of a very high standard, hugely
entertaining and surprisingly informative. One evening session was the Ceilidh,
where dancing skills are optional. The Course Dinner took place on the final
evening, where those responsible for making the Course a success &ndash;
sponsors, organisers, lecturers, tutors, students and local staff &ndash; were
all thanked for their efforts and everyone has a chance to relax after a very
busy week.
<P>
The Course was clearly much appreciated by the students, who provided us with
valuable feedback which will inform the content and structure of the next
Course in 2005. There continue to be particular challenges in the wide range of
previous experience of mathematics and crystallography. We are considering a
number of ways to provide more support for the mathematical aspects of the
Course. This year Peter Main kindly ran an impromptu session on essential
mathematics, but in 2005 this should be a formal part of the introduction to
the Course.
<P>
A book based on the Course, written by one past and three current lecturers and
entitled "Crystal Structure Analysis: Principles and Practice" was
published by OUP in late 2001 and has been very favourably reviewed. See
Crystallography News, December 2002, page 33.
<P>
The venue was again a highly successful element of the Course. Trevelyan
College offers lecture facilities in close proximity to accommodation, catering
and social amenities, so that different aspects of the Course can be smoothly
integrated.
<P>
The number of scientists who depend on crystallographic structure determination
continues to grow, as does the demand for structural results: it is an
essential technique but one where they must acquire expertise quickly and
alongside other methods.
<P>
The Intensive Course is a unique resource, offering concentrated study and
learning support not available elsewhere. Computational black boxes abound in
crystallography. In many cases these work reasonably well with their default
settings, but only by really appreciating how they work can difficult or
non-routine problems be solved: developing this understanding is a prime
objective of the Course. The Tenth Course is currently being planned, and will
take place in Durham in April 2005.
<P>
Special thanks are due to organisations which generously provided financial
support for the Course: EPSRC, IUCr, ICDD, Chemical Computing Group Inc,
Bruker-Nonius AXS, Pfizer Ltd, Oxford CryoSystems and Rigaku MSC.
