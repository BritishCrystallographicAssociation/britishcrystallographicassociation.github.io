The Synchrotron Radiation session was chaired by <B>Harry Powell</B> with speakers
Simon Teat from CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Tony Bell from the University of
Manchester, and Paul Raithby from the University of Bath.
<P>
<B>Simon Teat</B> spoke on "A Bright Way of Handling Difficult Data". He noted
that the scattering efficiency of a crystal depends on both the square of the
number of electrons and crystal volume, and inversely on the square of the unit
cell volume. The effect of disorder is that scattering power quickly tails off,
and other factors include wavelength of radiation, mosaicity and intensity of
the Xray beam. Synchrotron radiation offers an order of magnitude higher flux
than a conventional X-ray source and hence is useful for weakly diffracting
crystals, disordered crystals and crystals with supercells. Simon described
examples of crystal structure determinations where use of synchrotron radiation
allowed supercells to be determined. One example was of a microporous material
where conventional Xray data gave a disordered template molecule. The supercell
solution using synchrotron data gave a solution with a fully ordered template
molecule, allowing for the study of hydrogen bonding interactions.

After being presented with his fun-run T-shirt, <B>Tony Bell</B> spoke on "Phase
Transition in Mercury Sulphides". There are a number of polymorphs of HgS
including trigonal cinnabar, cubic metacinnabar and hexagonal hypercinnabar.
Tony reported variable temperature EDXRD (energy dispersive X-ray diffraction)
studies on a sample of synthetic HgS, where cubic metacinnabar was present at
all temperatures, although it was pseudocubic at temperatures below 583 K, with
a phase transition at 748 K to hypercinnabar. The high temperature phase was
retained on cooling. A mineral sample of metacinnabar also showed partial
transformation to hypercinnabar at high temperatures, while mineral cinnabar
did not undergo a phase transition. Combined EXAFS/XRD measurements were made
in situ during synthesis of HgS, where amorphous metacinnabar crystallised to
the pseudocubic form before forming a poorly crystalline cubic phase.
<P>
The final speaker for the session was <B>Paul Raithby</B> who spoke on "The Final
Frontier: Time Resolved Structural Chemistry". Normal crystal structures
give a time-averaged ground state structure. However, advances in dynamic
crystallography may allow us to have a better understanding of light induced
processes, and they have the potential to allow us to make molecular movies of
molecules going into excited states, reacting and forming products. He
described powder XRD studies of photoactivated cycloaddition of coumarin
3-carboxlic acid. Single crystals may be studied by determining a low
temperature ground state structure, then irradiation with laser light to excite
around 20% of molecules to a metastable state, then redetermining the structure
and looking for differences between the ground and excited state structures. A
co-crystal of 2,2'-dihydrobenzophenone and 4,13-diaza-18-crown[6] did not
show any significant structural differences between ground and excited states.
Photo-induced linkage isomerism in the complex
trans-[Ru(NH<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB>(SO<SUB>2</SUB>)Cl]Cl was
also studied. Paul finished by describing work in progress on molecules with
short-lived excited states that can be studied by synchronising laser pulses
with the bunch structure of synchrotron radiation.
