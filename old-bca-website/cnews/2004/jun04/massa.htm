"Crystal Structure Determination" gives a concise introduction to the
subject, with particular emphasis placed on the manner in which contemporary
analysis actually occurs. The second edition has been completely updated,
most notably the chapter describing experimental methods where description
of area-detector techniques has replaced much of the material on "classic"
methods. The book is aimed principally at students of chemistry who wish to
undertake their own structure determinations or to interpret more
effectively crystallographic results, encouraging them to "take a look
inside the black box". The author takes the view that it is important to
attain a broad appreciation of the basic principles as they apply in the
crystallographic arena and treats the fundamentals as briefly and
intuitively as possible. The resulting text is relatively short - ca. 200
pages - with a distinctly "matter-of-fact" attitude; the information content
is high and there is no unnecessary "padding".

The text follows a logical path through the subject, starting from a
description of the crystalline state and the nature of X-ray diffraction,
continuing with experimental techniques, structure solution and structure
refinement, and arriving at two chapters describing errors and the
interpretation of results. The overwhelming feel of the discussion is one of
brevity. In places this leads to beautifully lucid descriptions, for example
in the introduction of the reciprocal lattice. In other parts, however, the
discussion is perhaps a little too brief to stand entirely in isolation and
reference to more detailed texts might be beneficial. As an example,
direction vectors [111], [210], <I>etc</I>. are quite naturally employed
within a description of symmetry in the crystal systems, but prior
definition of the notation is overlooked. While the discussion remains quite
clear - often admirably so - to the more experienced reader, such anomalies
might be frustrating to the genuine novice.

The chapter concerning experimental techniques constitutes the major
revision from the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Edition and warrants particular mention.
The focus on area-detector methods makes for one of the most up-to-date
discussions currently available in a textbook of this kind. Some description
of film methods and serial diffractometers remains, giving a well-balanced
chapter that is a most welcome addition. This chapter also contains one
light-hearted highpoint of the book, namely the author's valiant attempt to
describe the ever-changing face of instrument manufacturers:
"Diffractometers operating in this way are manufactured by ... Bruker-AXS
(formerly Bruker, formerly Siemens, formerly Nicolet, formerly Syntex,
formerly Scintag)".
</p>
<P>
Several notable features appear towards the end of the book. There is a
brief but up-to-date description of crystallographic databases and the final
chapter describes a worked example of a structure determination. As is the
case throughout the book, the focus is placed on the SHELX suite of
programs. Some references to other programs are made through the text, and
there is a relatively comprehensive appendix, but the author's particular
program preference is clear. That possible restriction aside, the annotation
of the various input and output files from the SHELX programs are genuinely
informative and offer welcome insight into the perceived "black box".
Admittedly, the tutorial follows a somewhat similar line to the examples
presented in the SHELX manual, but it is well placed within the context of
the preceding text and thereby perhaps a little more accessible. It should
certainly prove to be a useful exercise for new SHELX users.

The strengths of this book are numerous. The presentation is excellent: the
diagrams are plentiful and often impressive, and the formatting of the text
is very pleasing to the eye. Particularly appealing is the "swashbuckling"
depiction of the character theta, bringing a lively flourish to each
sentence in which it appears. The book constitutes an excellent concise
reference, with a resoundingly up-to-date and relevant feel. It contains
many helpful tips and practical insights that help to distinguish it from
other books of this type. As a <I>first</I> introduction to the subject, it
is perhaps a little overwhelming. The brevity of the discussion, in
particular the early treatment of the fundamentals, gives a somewhat
intimidating feel in places. For the author's target audience, however - the
research chemist with a desire to appreciate more fully a technique that
they are likely to use with increasing frequency - the book should be a
helpful companion.
