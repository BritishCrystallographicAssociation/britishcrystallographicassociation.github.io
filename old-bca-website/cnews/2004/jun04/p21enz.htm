With reference to a particularly difficult proof in QED that he and Werner
Heisenberg had published in 1929, Wolfgang Pauli used to say "I warn the
curious!"  The same deterrent could be applied to this book.

<P>
The title says it all.  With 573 pages, it is certainly not brief, and it
definitely is a <I>scientific</I> biography. Do not embark upon reading this
book if you are not interested in Pauli's science, and approach it warily if
you derive little enjoyment from quantum mechanics.  A smattering of German
will also be helpful, as the early chapters are irritatingly peppered
(gespickt) with German terms (deutschen Ausdr&uuml;cken) from which the
English has been translated (&uuml;bersetzt), these being useful only
insofar as they reveal occasional mistranslations.  Another annoying habit
of the author's is to keep breaking the flow of the narrative with
incidental remarks, details and directions to the reader (e.g. see page 159)
which by right belong in a footnote or in the notes at the end of each
chapter.  The text reads rather like a Ph.D. thesis, and in common with
young Wolfgang's first publication - "it puts some strain on the reader's
goodwill."

However, it cannot be denied that this is a monumental opus.  Appearing in
print two years after the centenary of his birth, it is the first biography
of this Nobel Prize winner to be published, and it is written by someone who
knew him personally and worked with him.  Charles Enz was Pauli's last
assistant, at the ETH Z&uuml;rich.  He has analysed a vast body of source
material to produce a comprehensive and detailed account of Pauli's life and
work, which places the man and his science into the historical context of
twentieth century physics. The contents are arranged chronologically,
beginning with Pauli's ancestry, moving through his life and career in
Europe, in the USA during World War II and then back in Europe again, and
ending with the management of his scientific estate on his demise. The
reader is spared no detail of his theoretical physics, so brush up on your
spinor calculus.  Also included are interesting brief biographies of Pauli's
colleagues, acquaintances and contemporary scientists.

Pauli's contributions to physics are well known, but less famous is his
contribution to psychology.  Pauli first went to see Carl Jung in 1932
during a personal crisis. Part of his therapy was for him to record his
dreams.  Pauli went on to send Jung detailed accounts of some 1,300 of his
dreams, from which both his mental health and the science of psychology
benefited.  For a quarter of a century, Pauli and Jung corresponded and
exchanged ideas, and even jointly published essays.  No doubt it was this
contact which led to the development of Pauli's interest in the philosophy
of science, the history of ideas, and the relationship between natural
science and religion.

<P>
Most people reading this review will be familiar with Pauli's Exclusion
Principle, but fewer, I imagine, will have heard of the "Pauli Effect". 
Examples of this pop up from time to in the book and explain why colleagues
were anxious to keep Pauli out of their labs and well away from their
experiments.  It is known that Wolfgang Pauli's contemporaries admired his
wit, but this aspect of his character does not come across very well in
Charles Enz's account of his life.  The often clumsy translation of Pauli's
German does not help.

It will interest the crystallographer to learn that in 1933 Pauli posed
Heisenberg the "arbitrarily stupid question": Why should the nucleus be
built in analogy to the liquid drop and not to the crystalline state? 
Heisenberg's reason why is given on page 324.  However, the subsequent
discovery of quarks and neutron stars has since led to an FCC lattice model
of the nucleus being proposed  (see e.g. Cook, N. &amp; Dallacasa, V.,
<I>New Scientist</I> <B>117</B> no.1606, 31 March 1988, 44-46).  Maybe
Pauli's question was not so stupid after all - and there are crystals in
atoms as well as atoms in crystals.
