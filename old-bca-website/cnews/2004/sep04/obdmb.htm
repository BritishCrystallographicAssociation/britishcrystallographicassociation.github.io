<b>David Blow 1931-2004</b>
</center>
<P>
Professor David Blow, a founding father and past President of the BCA, 
died on 8 June 2004. He will be sorely missed.</p><p>

David was trained as a physicist who became a pioneer of protein
crystallography, a gifted and inspiring teacher, and an able administrator
who made great contributions to both the British and European scientific
communities.</p><p>

 He studied physics at Cambridge, then did his PhD with Max Perutz working
towards the crystal structure of haemoglobin in the old annex to the
Cavendish laboratory which housed the structural biology group. At that time
no structure with more than 150 atoms had been solved; haemoglobin had more
than 2500 atoms, and many people thought the task of phasing such a large
crystal was hopeless. However with the insight that "isomorphous
replacement", the technique of adding extra heavy atoms to a crystal without
disturbing the rest of the structure, could provide some phase information,
Perutz's team set out to develop these methods, to derive the phases and
assess their quality, and to find ways of interpreting the low resolution
electron density they yielded, using the pre-existing knowledge of protein
structure, the presence of A-helices, solvent volumes and so on. It was
wonderful time to be a research student, and David with his physicist
background, and the adaptability to acquire new skills, made many
fundamental contributions. The paper he wrote with Crick in 1959 <i>"The
treatment of error in the Isomorphous Replacement Method"</i>
 must be one of the
most widely cited in the field.</p><p>

After obtaining his PhD he spent two years in the USA, then returned to the
newly rehoused Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge - by this time
Perutz and Kendrew had been awarded the Nobel Prize, and conditions were
much better, although success soon brought the familiar overcrowding. He
joined Michael Rossmann, and together they developed the basis of "molecular
replacement", the technique which uses information from duplicate copies of
the same molecule, either within the same crystal or in a different crystal
form to derive or refine phases.  Thus David is a principal author of two
sets of ground-breaking papers on fundamental methods for to finding phases
for crystals of large molecules.</p><p>

However, both David and Michael were most interested in applying their
methodology to the solution of new structures and using the knowledge of the
3-dimensional organisation of the molecules to give biological insights.
David began to work on the crystal structure of the enzyme chymotrypsin,
whose mechanism was already under investigation down the corridor by his
biochemist colleague, Brian Hartley. The structure was solved by 1967, the
fourth protein structure to be determined, and they were able to describe
the first catalytic triad, a pattern of residues we now know is exploited to
facilitate many biochemical processes. (The project had the added bonus that
there were two copies of the molecule in the crystal asymmetric unit,
allowing him to exploit his molecular replacement methods.).Achieving this
level of collaboration between biochemist and physicist is still the ideal
for structural biology research groups. </p><p>

In 1977 David left the research orientated environment of the LMB to set up
the Biophysics group in the Physics department at Imperial College. This
presented him with new challenges familiar to academics, how to reconcile
maintaining a research profile with the demands of teaching, and the
inevitable administrative responsibilities, here made more difficult by the
need to maintain inter-disciplinary and inter-departmental collaborations.
He succeeded in the juggling act; many students remember his lucid, rigorous
and entertaining lectures, and his graduate students and those others he
interacted with remember his inspiring approach, enthusiastic, rigorous,
perceptive and sympathetic. He has written an outstanding text book built on
his teaching experience;  <a href="../../books/sep02.htm#6">
"An Outline of Crystallography for Biologists"</a>,
reviewed in the September 2002 issue of <I>Crystallography News</I>. He took
on many tasks for Imperial College, serving as Dean of Science and as Head
of Department, and helped to maintain and establish its scientific
excellence.</p><p>

The environment at Imperial persuaded him of the need to provide a forum where chemists, physicists and biologists could discuss crystallographic problems. At that time there was a Chemical Crystallography Group as part of the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the Institute of Physics had a Special Interest Group in crystallography, each organising their own meetings. It was agreed that these should merge to form the British Crystallographic Association. Typically, having recognised the need, he brought his persuasive and organisational skills to the task of setting up the committee, and encouraging a wide membership. By 1982 the BCA was well established and on a reasonable financial basis. He and Steven Wallwork have written a record of this, which could well be used as a model for any aspiring network. It was published by the Royal Society shortly before David's death (<I>Notes Rec. R. Soc. London</I> <B>58</B>,177-186 (2004)). His achievement in establishing this cross-disciplinary group has helped the whole British scientific community, fostering contacts not just between physicists and chemists, but also biologists, computer scientists and engineers. He will be sadly missed at BCA meetings, which he continued to attend regularly till last year where he chaired the Max Perutz Memorial lecture.

His influence will continue, carried on by his students and colleagues, many of them now leading their own research groups, by his friends, and by new generations who are introduced to the subject by his excellent book.</p>
