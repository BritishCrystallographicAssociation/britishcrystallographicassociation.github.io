At the other end of the scale, the Engineering and 
      Physical Sciences Research Council is funding a free CD-rom called Living       in a Materials World aimed at A-level students. </p>
      <p >It takes students on a virtual tour of a top research 
      facility at CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, that 
      handles particle acceleration. For a free copy, email:

      Scientists and teachers launch a free resource for A-level physics</p>
      <p >Teachers from around the country have been working 
      alongside scientists to develop Living in a Materials World - a CD-ROM 
      that is tailor-made to meet the requirements of A-level physics courses. 
      At a time when school budgets are under increasing pressure, the 
      professionally produced resource is available free of charge, thanks to 
      funding from the EPSRC (the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research 
      Council)</p>
      <p >The scientists come from ISIS, a large experimental 
      facility at CCLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, which is       used to study materials at a molecular scale. It has an international 
    reputation for cutting-edge research in physics, earth science, chemistry, 
      materials science, engineering, biology and archaeology.</p>
      <p >This project offers a unique opportunity for students 
    who live too far away to visit the Laboratory. The virtual tour means they 
      can look around the particle accelerators and find out how they work, 
      watch video interviews with some of the people who work there, and find 
      out about the latest research. Every section of the CD-ROM has been 
      designed with the A-level course specifications in mind.</p>
      <p >The interactive CD-ROM is packed with detailed 
      information, stunning images and animations and includes a glossary, a 
      historical overview of the development of particle physics technology, 
web links and other sources of information, questions, a curriculum audit and 
      model answers contained in a separate teacher's section.</p>

      <b>Living in a materials world</b></p>
      <p>This CD is from the ISIS facility at the Rutherford 
      Appleton Laboratory and its goal is to provide information about atomic 
      nuclei, particle accelerators, materials and the ISIS research facility. 
      It's aimed at A-level (16+) students and I'd say it was right on target. 
      I've seen a lot of CDs in doing these reviews and things do seem to be 
      starting to change for the better. Most CDs used to fail to make the most 
      of the multimedia at their disposal; now that seems to be changing. The 
      way that the information is presented here is very good slick graphics, 
      catchy music, flashy videos and animations; you can't help but want to 
    look at the screen. While there aren't any interactive applets or anything 
     similar this CD doesn't really set out to be like that. This comes across 
      as more of an electronic textbook and it does the job brilliantly. The 
      text is broken down into small manageable and easily readable chunks and 
     most of the pages of text have a selection of images, video or animations 
      to look at. There is a glossary and the words that appear in it are 
      hyperlinked to the glossary where they appear in the text. While I would 
      imagine students sitting down to work their way through this CD many of 
      the images can be magnified to full screen size, ideal for using with a 
      data projector. All of the images and movies are easily found by 
      ‘exploring' the CD rather than ‘opening' it, should you want to project 
      them.</p>
      <p >OK, so it’s an excellent e-textbook as regards 
      presentation, but most textbooks have questions don't they? Well so does 
      this one. You can look at the questions while using the CD or you can 
      print them off as Word documents which means you can edit questions, and 
      for classroom activities the copyright for photocopying is waived. But 
      what about answers? I hate setting A-level questions for homework as it 
      usually takes me longer to work out the answers than my students; fear 
    not, the answer are here too. Not only are they here but also they're in a 
      teacher's area that is password-protected. The teacher's area includes 
      print-outs of the answers and the text from each section, a list of 
      curriculum links and contact details and an extensive list of resources. 
      The subject areas covered that teachers would be interested in include 
      diffraction, spectroscopy, carbon-60 superconductors and stress in 
      materials. I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on this CD. 
      Finally, did I mention it's FREE?!</p>

      <p>The world of muons and magnetic multilayers is not one 
      where every A-level science student feels at home. <i>Living in a 
      Materials World</i> is a very well-designed CD-Rom that slots these 
     concepts and many others - like superconductors and particle accelerators 
      - into the lives of real working scientists and technicians. Using a 
      mixture of animation, information and interviews, it takes visitors on a 
    virtual tour of ISIS, a cutting-edge experimental facility where materials 
      are studied at a molecular level. There are challenging questions along 
      the way - and model answers in a teacher's section.</p>

<p >Bernard Taylor, winner of the Institute of Physics 
      ‘Teacher of Physics ’ Award 2002,) says, 
 "Living in a Materials World offers 
      students and teachers a fascinating insight into cutting-edge research 
      using the ISIS pulsed neutron source at the CCLRC Rutherford Appleton 
      Laboratory. It provides a very useful resource with lots of interesting 
      curriculum links. Every school should have one!” </p>
