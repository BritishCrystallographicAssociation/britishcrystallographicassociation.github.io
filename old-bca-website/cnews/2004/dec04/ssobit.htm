<b><i>"Sam"</i></b> Small was born in Birmingham 
where his father was a builder who passed
on many of his constructional skills.  Sam's scientific career began after
he left school when he became an assistant in the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Birmingham, working with Professor Gordon Cox.   He
studied part-time for a London external BSc in Physics, followed by a PhD in
Crystallography from Birmingham in 1947 and DSc in 1982.  Although he had
worked for Gordon Cox, Sam was never regarded as a "pippin" as he was not
one of his research students, his PhD being supervised by F. J. Llewellyn
after Cox had left Birmingham for Leeds.

Sam became a Lecturer and later Senior Lecturer in Chemistry at Birmingham
and for nearly 20 years gave the course on general Physical Chemistry to new
entrants and on crystallography to students in the final year.  He was
responsible for much of the practical Physical Chemistry throughout the
programme for BSc.  He had a lively interest in the students and their
performance and he retained memories of most of the many hundreds with whom
he had dealings.

When Gordon Cox left Birmingham, Sam set about re-establishing X-ray
crystallography in the old Frankland building before moving into
purpose-built accommodation in the new Haworth block.  As for many
crystallographers of that era, it was a case of do-it-yourself and adapting
war-surplus equipment; the laborious hand calculations before the advent of
computers were made somewhat easier by Sam's construction of a machine,
based on the rotation of gears and sliding of bars, for calculating sin and
cos 2(<I>hx+ky+lz</I>).  This was later superseded by a well-worn set of
Beevers-Lipson strips, and later still by use of very early computers
including LEO and ENIAC.  Sam and his research students were successful in
their endeavours and their work became well known and respected, many of the
students later obtaining lectureships in crystallography at other
Universities or taking up research posts in the then new field of scientific
computing.  A very notable achievement of Sam while at Birmingham was his
building of a complete 4-circle diffractometer and the associated HT
generator and counting chain with the assistance of Steve Travers.  The
instrument was very accurate and led to the determination of one of the
lowest R-values known at that time for a 3-D structure.  Many modern
instruments depend upon a closely similar design.

In 1964, Sam became one of the pioneers at the new University of Lancaster. 
He quickly established a working laboratory for crystallography in the
temporary accommodation in the former furniture factory of Waring and
Gillow, before moving into the comparative luxury of the new buildings at
Bailrigg, where an ICL mainframe allowed full advantage to be taken of
developments in crystallographic computing.  He was appointed to a
Readership and with his research students worked very effectively up to and
beyond his retirement in 1989.  His last years were marred by Parkinson's
disease but he earned tremendous admiration by carrying on his work with
courage and determination.   It was a great disappointment when he lost his
laboratory due to the University's financially-driven decision to close
Chemistry as an undergraduate course, despite Lancaster's strong research
performance and international reputation in polymer chemistry.  Sam made
sure that his remaining equipment was transferred to deserving institutions
where facilities for crystallography had hitherto been limited.  Thereafter
he made use of instrument time provided by friends and former research
students to obtain new data; like most crystallographers he also had a
tremendous backlog of unpublished results to write up.  Some of Sam's most
important studies involved explosives, in particular the polymorphs of HMX
and complexes of RDX and BSX.  Much of this work was regarded as highly
secret and, to his regret, he was allowed to publish only a small part of
his results.  He was examining new complexes of HMX quite recently.  His
last publication was <i>"An x-ray diffraction study of partially ordered
electron density in clathrates of Dianin's compound that include simple
carboxylic acids"</i> in 2003.

Sam was active in the IOP X-ray Analysis Group (later the Crystallography
Group) and in the RSC Crystallography Group; he served as Secretary of both
Groups at various times and was instrumental in organising many conferences. 
He played a major role in the formation of the BCA and in the organisation
of the Inaugural Meeting at Durham in 1981; he was BCA Secretary from 1985
to 1987.  Sam also had many interests outside crystallography: before his
illness took hold, he was a keen player of squash and had earlier been an
enthusiastic member of Kings Norton Rugby Union FC.  He was interested in
classical music and British birds and was accepted as an expert on Alpine
plants, especially the genus <I>Primula</I>.  He played a prominent part in
the planning of sporting facilities and the introduction of a tutorial
system at Lancaster.  A few evening classes in Birmingham and a developing
interest in the chemistry and crystalline properties of stoneware glazes led
to Sam becoming an accomplished craftsman potter, manufacturing his own
glazes for a multitude of useful and decorative hand-thrown items.  The
throwing wheel and kiln he constructed himself.  As well as supplying his
own household and those of friends and relatives with plates, bowls, coffee
services and the like, he sold many items in aid of charity.  After moving
to the North West, the family first lived at Gressingham in the Lune Valley
while their house at Denny Beck was being built.  Sam turned his new garage
into a pottery, and a field into a garden which was the envy of all who saw
it. </p>

Sam's wife Mary died in 1991.  He is survived by their three sons Nicholas,
 Richard and Jonathan and by his brother John who farmed in Pembrokeshire.
