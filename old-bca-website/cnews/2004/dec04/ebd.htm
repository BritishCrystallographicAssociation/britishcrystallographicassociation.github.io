The <a href="#star">photograph</a>  <sup>*</sup> of the 
author on the dust jacket is a good introduction to
this book. The author's enigmatic and attractive smile indicates that he is
going to cover a huge number of topics and persuade his readers that they
know a great deal less about them than they thought they did. In the
meantime, he is going to have a great deal of fun, and to make sure that his
readers do too!<br><br>
In the preface, Brian Davies, himself a mathematician, makes this prediction:
<br>
<b>In spite of the fact that highly mathematical theories often provide
very accurate predictions, we should not, on that account, think that such
theories are true, or that nature is governed by mathematics. In fact, the
scientific theories most likely to be around in a thousand years' time are
those which are the <I>least</I> mathematical - for example evolution, plate
tectonics, and the existence of atoms.</b>

And in all of his brushes with theories and theoreticians, philosophers and
theologians, theories with which he disagrees are treated with respect and
moderation. About the only time he uses the word <I>anger</I> is on page 72,
where he presents a problem that is impossible to solve and comments: <br><br>

<i>
>I frequently hear mathematicians saying that such questions pose no problem
'in principle'.   This phrase makes me quite angry. It might mean, 'I know
it is not actually possible but would like to close my mind and pretend that
I could do it if I really wanted to'. Another possible meaning is, 'I do not
regard the difficulty of carrying out a task as an interesting issue.'
Either interpretation leaves the speaker cut off from the mainstream of
human activities.</i>
</p>
<P>
Such attitudes make this reviewer angry too!<br><br>

The book is a good mix of mathematics/science with linguistics/philosophy.
The are chapters dealing with pure mathematics, probability theory,
astronomy geology and biological evolution exploring the nature of knowledge
about them. There must always be some mistake for a reviewer to find
somewhere in a book, and I certainly have not spotted many. I can do no
worse than point out that Davies is wrong in stating (p 211) that
<SUP>13</SUP>C is a radioactive isotope. This isotope is indeed responsible
for a lot of our knowledge about the world, but precisely because it is
<I>not</I> radioactive! These "scientific" chapters are enclosed between the
outer chapters on language and reductionism, and the whole is both
convincing and enjoyable.
</p>
<P>
The final chapters are, naturally the most speculative. He attempts to
explain the difference between "empiricist" and "realist" theories of
science, and has to be content "with a description of science as it now is,
and to attribute goals only to individual scientists." (p. 270).  One of the
most delightful bits occurs in the discussion of anthropic principles, where
Davies points out how easy it is to produce a bogus coincidence, and he
supplies the one that he "found  ... by playing around for a few minutes
with powers of pi": It concerns the ratio of the masses of the proton and
the electron: m<SUB>p</SUB>/m<SUB>e</SUB> = 6&pi;<SUP>5</SUP>, with an in
error of less than 0.002%. This is a matter which needs to be emphasised in
all fields. Probably the most elegant spoof of all of this genre is R.A.
Knox's "proof" from remarkable cryptograms that Tennyson's <I>In
Memoriam</I> was actually written by Queen Victoria (<I>Essays in Satire</I>
Sheed and Ward, 1954).
</p>

<P>
His humane approach is gently put on p. 253: "Science is a system of
thought, and should not claim to have a monopoly on the truth. But neither
can its achievements be dismissed as of no import." This has come a long way
from Sigmund Freud's noted summation: "No, our science is no illusion. But
an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can
get elsewhere." (<I>The Future of an Illusion</I>,1927). <br><br>

Finally, a quote from p 213: <br>

<i>"The most severe criticism of extreme religious fundamentalism is not 
that it is wrong (scientists are also sometimes wrong), but that it 
discourages people from trying to understand the marvellously 
complicated world around us."</i><br><br>


For those who <I>do</I> wish to understand more about this world, 
here is a book that can be strongly recommended.
