 The thought has never crossed my mind that it would have been interesting
to have had the chance to meet Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein. In the case
of <b>Sir Lawrence Bragg</b>, who died in 1971, my entry into crystallography in
1974, just 3 years later, makes it somehow galling to have been so close,
and yet so far, in time to have seen him in action. Obviously my point here,
in mentioning Newton and Einstein in the same breath, is that he is such an
iconic figure in the whole development of X-ray crystal structure analysis,
and the many discoveries with which Bragg was closely involved in, that I
feel one must rank him in the Newton or Einstein league in the history of
science. 
</p>

<P>
The author of this biography immediately explains his reason though for
writing on  Sir Lawrence Bragg ('Bragg'), which is that Bragg is still the
youngest ever Nobel Prize-winner and that fact alone makes Bragg an icon.
There is a 'however' though, which is that Bragg was Nobel Prize-winner in
1915 jointly with his father, 
<b>Sir William Henry Bragg</b>. His father
specialised more on crystallographic instrumentation and apparatus, and was
also preoccupied for several years in the early 20th century with the idea
that X-rays were corpuscles rather than waves. But, and skipping on a few
years, and to press the point about the strength of this father and son
team, they agreed to split the world of crystal structure analysis into
organics for the father and inorganics for the son. Sir William Henry Bragg
died in 1942 and Bragg broke away into the biological (organic!) world when
he moved to Cambridge from Manchester to succeed Rutherford in 1938.
Unexpectedly, Bragg teamed up there with <b>J D Bernal's</b>
 former student <b>Max Perutz.</b> Together they pioneered the development of protein crystallography
until, with Kendrew, the protein structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin
were eventually determined in the late 1950s. On the way, also under Bragg's
patronage, <b>Watson</b> and <b>Crick</b> determined the DNA double helix structure in
1953, based on the fibre diffraction data from Kings College 
(<b>Franklin</b> and <b>Wilkins</b>). 
</p>
<P>
This is a very quick sketch of the story, but leaving out the major
precocious moment in 1913 of a very young Bragg, <I>i.e.</I> as a Cambridge
postgraduate, firstly deriving what became known as Bragg's law and then
also deducing the first crystal structure, that of sodium chloride. Bragg's
father meanwhile, converted to X-rays being waves by the crystal diffraction
grating results of Laue in 1912, built the first X-ray diffractometer. Bragg
is quoted by the author as referring to "the superior nature of data from
your diffractometer, Dad,". This and many others are amongst the jewels of
quotations that the author sets before the reader. 
</p>
<P>
Indeed, the author has clearly worked extremely hard on this book. The title
itself, a very good one, is a quote of Bragg from what seems to me a rather
obscure lecture he gave in 1928; the full quotation being "Light is a
messenger, carrying a story about the form of the object....". A proper
measure of the author's labours though, rather than saying he had read even
the obscure lectures, are in the 1008 historical references at the back of
the book, and numerous further footnotes throughout the book. These not only
list numerous archived letters of Bragg and others but also interviews with
a variety of key players. One has a growing feel of privilege at reading
this carefully prepared biography.
</p>

<P>
There were also tricky details for the author to get right, specifically the
tensions between father and son, in spite of the obvious filial devotion
that I have touched on already. Obviously, as someone who did not see this
all unfolding I was left feeling that the author had given a credible,
evidence-based treatment of this important aspect of Bragg's life story. But
the author pushed this too far, I felt, in extrapolating to Jim Watson being
seen by Bragg as equivalent to himself as the young overlooked genius behind
the DNA double helix (with Bragg viewing Crick as playing the equivalent
role of his father, in danger of getting all the credit). 
</p>
<P>
I was surprised to learn that Bragg was subjected to bouts of depression and
angry outbursts. This was brought out in several places in the book, with
footnote evidence back up. I suppose I didn't want to believe this, spoiling
as it did my rosy view of one of my science heroes. However I did already
know that Bragg had had a nervous breakdown. Anyway, the genial smiling
character on the front cover of this book doesn't reflect this aspect. Also,
my prior readings of Bragg anecdotes, admittedly only two, from A Random
Walk in Science (published by IOP) showed that Bragg had a keen sense of
humour. 
</p>

<P>
There were some aspects of the book that I didn't like. The exposition of
the crystallography was overly long in the early chapters, I felt. Like
Bragg's aunt, of a later chapter, who hadn't a clue when Bragg tried to
explain his latest crystal structure, I could imagine that non-scientists
reading this book would be equally baffled by these details of the science.
I am also still mulling over the tactic of not gathering the family life
details of Bragg, as a father, into one chapter; it seemed on several
occasions that the author had to mix this into many chapters to ease the
science details along. The family details deserved a better focus. [The
advantage for the author was of course to keep a strict chronology of the
story.] 
 </p>
<P>
In retrospect, Bragg had <b>three</b> distinct career phases. 
These came after the
precocious beginning and the First World War when he was a Major leading a
team doing sound ranging to pinpoint the enemy guns. There were his
<b>Manchester period</b> (1919 to 1937),
 his <b>Cambridge period</b> (1938 to 1954) and
then the <b>Royal Institution period</b> (1954 to 1965). Manchester itself was
thoroughly slated. The most memorable anecdote was that the fog was so thick
it even prevented seeing the stage from the back of the theatre! Altogether,
Manchester was apparently a dirty, grimy, indeed uncivilised place. Bragg's
wife was glad to leave Manchester behind when moving south. [What a
difference a few decades makes - Manchester today has no fog, has
stone-cleaned buildings, and is a cultural scene of thriving orchestras,
theatres and national sports facilities!]
</p>

<P>
For anyone interested in the history of how our subject has come to where it
is today, this book offers a feast of interesting details. In addition to
the above history one must highlight the fascinating ins and outs of Bragg's
rivalry with <b>Linus Pauling</b>. As one example, I mention their battle over
their respective Nobel Prize nominations, leading up to the 1962 Nobel Prize
awards for Perutz, Kendrew, Watson, Crick and Wilkins. This is revealed by
the letters Bragg and Pauling wrote to each other, and into the Nobel
Foundation, at the time. [Bragg won that tussle......]. There are also
Bragg's major achievements in enthusing schoolchildren in science and
discovery through his lectures, especially but not exclusively, in his
period as Director of The Royal Institution.  </p>

<P>
As I arrived at the end of the book I admired the way in which the author
left the last words on Bragg to David Phillips, who had worked with Bragg at
the RI, by quoting from Phillips' Biographical Memoir of Bragg for The Royal
Society. Indeed those last pages of this biography brought a crescendo of
feeling about this great scientist and person, Sir Lawrence Bragg, whom I
would never be able to meet; so close in time to the start of my career and
yet so far. I was grateful for this book because I felt I had really got to
see the person who had driven the science.
