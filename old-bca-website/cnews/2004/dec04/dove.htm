This book in the Oxford Master Series in Condensed Matter Physics is a very
welcome addition to the armoury of textbooks in this area. It is
particularly refreshing to see in the title the words "an atomic view" since
so much of the emphasis in physics teaching is on the electronic view with
the atoms simply providing a periodic (in the case of crystals) backdrop. 
</p

In this book, the author provides a clear, cogent and relatively
self-contained late undergraduate (I would say third or fourth
year)/first-year postgraduate grounding in the essentials of
crystallography, crystal physics, lattice dynamics and phase transitions.
Discussion of structure and bonding takes the first five chapters of the
book, progressing from packing arguments to formal crystallography,
including a nice summary of point group and space group symmetry. 

It is a pleasure to see structures such as 
TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, ZrP<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>7 </SUB> and perovskites under
discussion in a physics text-book - progression beyond the crystal
structures of NaCl and diamond is a welcome advance! Furthermore, sections
are included on disordered and amorphous materials too, and one of the
examples of from the Diffraction chapter (Ch 6) is the structure of glasses
from neutron scattering, an example that will disabuse physics students of
the myth that diffraction techniques are only applicable to crystals.
</p>
<P>
From Chapter 7 onwards, the emphasis of the book changes to Physical
Properties (Ch 7), Lattice Dynamics, their thermodynamic consequences and
their Experimental investigation (Ch 8-10), Anharmonic interactions (Ch 11)
and Displacive Phase Transitions (Ch 12). This necessarily covers a
treatment of tensor properties, which runs the gauntlet of first-rank to
fourth-rank properties in only 13 pages. Although this may be rather swift
for the average student, it does accurately reflect the sort of period one
has to try and teach this subject in a typical physics module, and there are
sensible suggestions for additional reading.

The treatment of lattice dynamics is very clear with excellent diagrams for
example, showing the atomic displacements in whole planes associated with
longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes. After giving the monatomic and
diatomic chains, which are standard undergraduate fodder, the author gives
the generalisation for more complex cases, e.g. for a 2-D crystal of
symmetry as low as <I>mm2</I>. These more difficult examples are most useful
- whilst they can be omitted for the standard undergraduate teaching, they
provide a useful primer for specialist final-year project teaching or even
elementary post-graduate study. In this sense, the book can generally be
used at more than one level. The final chapter on Displacive Phase
Transitions is an excellent summary of what you need to know <I>i.e.</I>,
the knowledge you should not be without.  It covers Landau and soft-mode
theories and includes discussion of ferroelectric, ferroelastic and
incommensurate phase transitions. 
</p>
<P>
The numerous appendices A to N are a useful resource: A throws the spanner
of reality into the works of the ideal crystal by admitting that not all
crystals are perfect, introducing domains and domain walls amongst other
defects. My own preference would have been to see this subject covered in
the main text - however, it is present and clearly explained in the
appendix. Most of the other appendices take the opportunity to explain
theory, including theory of crystallography such as the Ewald sphere
construction and the Wilson plot, in greater depth, which is entirely
appropriate. The closing pages of the book are devoted to the answers to the
well-posed problems found at the end of each Chapter. These constitute an
additional resource for the busy lecturer and will certainly be widely used
and adapted.
</p>

<P>
In summary, I found this to be a well thought-out, clear and modern book on
the structural side of condensed matter physics. Whilst ideally suited to
undergraduate physics students, I think much of the book could sensibly used
to teach equivalent modules in chemistry and, given the author's background,
I expect it to be useful for mineralogy/earth sciences also. On a personal
note, I shall be recommending the book for my third and fourth year students
in Ferroics next term.</p>
