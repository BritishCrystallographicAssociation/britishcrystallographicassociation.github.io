<P>
This book is a huge piece of work, containing, among other things, more than
2500 equations with numerous references and tables of data. It is strongly
based on the 1950 work <I>Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules</I> by G.
Herzberg,  The book deals mainly with work done since then, and has itself
been some 30 years in the making. For those interested in this topic, it
should provide a definitive sourcebook for many years to come.
