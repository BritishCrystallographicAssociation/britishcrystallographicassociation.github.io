<h1>Instructions for Authors</h1> 
<h2>submitting articles to 'Crystallography News'</h2>
 <br>
      'Crystallography News' pages are printed from A4 portrait pages (210mm
by 297mm ) camera ready copy, printed on one side of the paper,  with
generous margins. The minimum sizes of margins are 20mm, top, left, right,
and  25mm at the bottom to leave space for a page number. The number of
words is not important, but remember that the A4 is photographically reduced
to A5 before printing, so text should be at least 12 point to be legible
following reduction.  A sans serif font such as Helvetica copies better 
than 'Times Roman' which has thinner parts to letters which sometimes  get
lost in copying.<p>

 <br>
Line diagrams reduce well; avoid text or diagrams with grey shades made by 
laser printers with dots at different sizes and spacing because they can 
become almost black all over following photographic reduction obscuring 
whatever you were trying to show. Photographs can be included, but we prefer 
you to send a print which will be returned about a month after the 
publication date. <br>
 <br>
If you send paper, please use a stiff backed envelope to prevent my
friendly postman folding it. <p>
 <br>

I also like to put the articles up on our Web pages after I have sent 
the issue to the printer, so I would appreciate an ASCII electronic file; 
if you already have one in HTML format send that, otherwise I will edit the
ASCII file for you. The files may be sent electronically through the MAIL 
system or through the post on a 3.5" floppy disc (PC or Acorn formats). 
<strong>PLEASE do not send </strong>files larger than 1.5Mbytes through the
mail system. If your article contains images, please send them separately
and remember that they are reproduced at small sizes and in monochrome,
so do not waste network time and space by sending colour images, 
grey scale ones of 4 or 8 bpp maximum resolution reproduce well.<p>
 <br>

I can print PostScript files here on 600 bpi printers, but if you are
sending it through the MAIL system, please make sure records have a maximum
of 256 characters. (Some word processors put a whole paragraph in one
record, and the mailer ignores most of it.) <p>
 <br>
<strong>One Day Meeting Reports</strong>. 
Try to be concise when reporting on a one day meeting, particularly specialist
ones held by one of the BCA Groups; there is always likely to be enough space
in the issue for a single A4 page rport, or occasionally two pages. Longer 
reports may be badly summarised by the editor who rarely has time to check 
changes with the author and is not expert in every field.  Longer reports can 
be stored on the BCA WWW Group pages. <p>
<strong>TLAs</strong> 
You may know what <a href="TLAs.html">XRD, XAFS, PSD, TDA, GMR, MAD, etc. mean</a>
 but not all BCA Members will, so <em>please try to define any abbreviations</em>
the first time you use them. <p>

<strong>Deadlines:</strong>
 'Crystallography News' is published on the 1st day of March,
June, September and December. Articles should reach the editor, (address
below), by the <strong>last Friday of the first week of the month preceding
the publication date.</strong> <p>
 <br>

<h2>All Reviewers:</h2><br>

Please include full details of title, author, publisher name and address,
publication date and cost in the UK (Is it good value for money?). Tell the
 reader what the book contains, and which audience this author is writing for,
 undergraduate, research student, popular science, etc. 
How does it compare with any previously published work on this subject? 
 How complete is it?  Have all the relevant areas been covered, or have some 
important ones been left out? Have you found any errors? How good is the index
and the bibliography?<p>
 <br><p>
Reviews are normally about one A4 page in length with generous margins. They are usually about 500 to 600 words long, very large or important works can be up
to a maximum of 1000 words.</p>
 <br>

 <strong>Book reviewers:</strong> give ISBN, number of pages, whether hard or softback<br> 
 <br>
 <strong>Software Reviewers:</strong> give type of computer and operating system required.
  Tell the reader what you think of the manual, the installation
  instructions, any problems you had in using the program, and if possible
  how it compares with any other similar programs. <br>
