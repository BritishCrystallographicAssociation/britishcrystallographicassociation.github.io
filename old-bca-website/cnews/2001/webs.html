<strong>Quasicrystals</strong><br>

Would you like to know more about Quasicrystals? 
For an introduction to Quasicrystals logon to
<a href="http://members.nbci.co/_XOOM/steffenweber/index.html">
http://members.nbci.co/_XOOM/steffenweber/index.html</a>
 or
<a href="http://www.nirm.go.jp/-weber/index.html">
http://www.nirm.go.jp/-weber/index.html</a>

The site also contains information on books, articles, software and
other websites related to Quasicrystals, and links to research
groups working on structure refinement.

<strong>Standards for Diffraction</strong><br>

Many diffraction users (including myself) are not fully aware of all
the standards available to help them in their work. It is the aim of
the Industrial Group to put together a list of all the available
standards and some hints and tips on their use. In fact it is really two
lists as we can consider physical standards or Standard Reference
Materials (SRM's) as one list and Standard Operating Procedures
(SOP's) as a separate list. The list can be found on the Industrial
Group pages at the BCA web site in the July 1999 copy of the
Industrial Group Newsletter. It is not exhaustive and I rely on you to
let me know of any that are not included. The lists will be stored
and updated on our Web site with links to the various suppliers
hopefully into a growing and useful resource.

<strong>Making Matter- The atomic structure of crystals</strong><br>

This is at the ILL website <a href="http://www.ill.fr/dif/3D-crystals/">
http://www.ill.fr/dif/3D-crystals/</a>
There is an introduction explaining the importance of atomic structure
and pages for related topics including close packing, compounds,
bonding, gems and minerals, layered structures and superconductors. 
All the pages are illustrated with clear, colourful images of 3D 
structures of inorganic materials in the ILL's ICSD-for-WWW database.

<strong>The Online Macromolecular Museum (OMM)</strong><br>

The Online Macromolecular Museum (OMM) at 
<a href="http://www.clunet.edu/BioDev/omm/gallery.htm"> 
http://www.clunet.edu/BioDev/omm/gallery.htm </a> is a site for
the display and study of macromolecules. The OMM's exhibits are 
interactive 
tutorials on individual molecules with explanations of important
biochemical features which are linked to illustrative images of molecules. 
In order to view the macromolecular exhibits at the OMM you will need
two, free items which you can access from the web site:
<ol>
  <li> A FRAMES-capab!e browser.
Netscape Navigator 4.73 strongly recommended but NOT
Navigator 6 and NOT MS IE
  <li> MDL Chemscape Chime(v.2.0+ recommended),
</ol>
