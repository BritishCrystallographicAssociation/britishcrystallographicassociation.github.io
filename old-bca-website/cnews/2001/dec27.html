<h2>Computing and Teaching Microsymposia at ECM 2001</h2>
<p> The ancient Jagellonian University (founded in 1364) of the splendid
architectural city of Kraków, was the host of one of the contrasting final
morning Microsymposia on the contemporary topic of  <em>Computing and
Teaching.</em> Six speakers delighted the audience with a wide range of
topics on using the Internet for distance learning, virtual courses in
crystallography and a number of different models for delivery of the
curriculum. Some key issues regarding the pace of introducing the new
technologies, the role of government in delivering mass education and the
pressures on institutions in responding to the novel methods of education
were raised during the talks.

 Y. Epelboin (CNRS, Paris) [1] in the opening address asked, "What can we
learn from actual experience ?" and compared the US experience with the
European paradigm. He projected that the world education market [2] by 2005
would be worth an estimated 90 billion US dollars. Distance learning would
open up the accessibility to virtual documents and libraries facilitating
politicians to contain the budget for education. However, the case was
argued that the rich diverse tapestry of language and traditions that is
European culture could not so easily be swayed by an economic model.
Co-operation via Brussels would ensure that the "Revolution would go
marching on..." was the idiosyncratic Gallic rally.

At the heart of G. Chapuis' talk (Lausanne, Switzerland) was the "nuts and
bolts" of implementing  interactive web applications of Java applets to
provide simulation of some key crystallographic concepts. He listed the
ingredients for a virtual course in crystallography concentrating on the
tools for simulation and provided a number of real time demonstrations of
the Ewald sphere, Laue pattern diagrams and Fourier transforms. The didactic
road is long to a complete course on the Internet although within a Java
environment using a web browser simulations can be performed, directly
independent of the computer platform being used. This time the baton was
passed on to the IUCr to promote and establish structured learning modules
for potential crystallography students. C. Sansom (Birkbeck, London)
described at length the Masters level distance learning courses in
Structural Biology offered by Birkbeck College since 1996. She gave an
overview profile of the average student taking the course as mature with
demanding professional careers quipping "that there were no typical
students".

The  communication links between students and teachers were maintained using
a purpose built Internet chat room or MUD for short (multi-user Dimension).
Much of the material is written in simple HTML which can be run on a low
specification computer, course material being made available at regular
intervals throughout the year. It was stressed that fees were kept low to
encourage wide student participation in the Advanced certificate on the
Principles of Protein Structure (PPS) [4].

The first of two talks on powder diffraction commenced with A. Le Bail
(Universite du Maine, France) who challenged the audience to think "Where is
all the knowledge." and reminded us that distance learning was in its
centenary. The dangers of online education are well- established [5] with
the automation of Higher Education likened to creating "Digital diploma
mills" as the pervasive new information technologies advance. The provision
of a powder diffraction course was inspired by the Birkbeck model and the
speaker emphasised the deliberation in choosing between a synchronous and
asynchronous mode of learning. The course material with pedagogic exercises
is available on Structure Determination by Powder Diffractometry (SDPD) [6]
and can be viewed on the web. Caution was advised that expert systems could
kill the interest of deep learning and that an explosion of software
diversity could pose a nightmare for student and teacher alike. An
anachronistic talk on Crystallographic Autostereograms was given by A.
Katrusiak (Poznan, Poland) using handouts for the audience to practice on.
The speaker presented a clear reminder of the optics of the eye and its
ability to perceive perspective by binocular vision. An interesting talk
that prompted a member of the audience, R. Shirley (Surrey, England), to
remark that confusion over the term stereogram could be avoided if it
referred only to that normally used in stereographic projection.

Returning to the topic of powder diffraction on the Internet J. Cockcroft
(Birkbeck, London) stressed again the need for life-long learning and the
proud tradition that Birkbeck has maintained in teaching during its 178-year
history. The compatibility of the Powder Diffraction on the Web course [7]
with both Netscape and Internet Explorer 3 was mentioned as well as being
Java/Java script free. As it is easy "to get lost in hyperspace" the
material makes extensive use of course navigation buttons on the web pages.
With such an undertaking, 'a priori' knowledge cannot be assumed, but full
use of colour is made in pictures and photographs contained in the HTML
documents. Awareness of copyright is also an issue. The material itself is
organised into three areas; experimental methods covering basic
crystallography, diffraction and symmetry, data analysis covering both
quantitative & qualitative aspects and a project on Rietveld refinement. On
the topic of programming options it was revealed that the space group
diagrams used in the course were written in Fortran code, a spin off being a
commercially <a href="../books/cds.html#p32">
available CD-ROM.</a> The debate over interactive versus
downloadable software was touched upon again. Finally the matter of
assignments was mooted and their role in good housekeeping recorded. They
act as an aid to learning, are complementary to the course material and
provide model answers and feedback to the students in their distance
learning environment away from the more traditional face to face approach
that is being challenged more and more in the 21st Century.</p>
