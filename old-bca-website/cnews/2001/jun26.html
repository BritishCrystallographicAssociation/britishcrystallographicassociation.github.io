<h2>Education in Crystallography<BR>
Report of a discussion meeting held in Reading<br> at the Spring Meeting,  7 April 2001<BR>
</h2>
<HR>
<P>
This discussion was prompted by the Presidential letter from Henk Schenk in
an IUCr newsletter early last year. He suggested that we should all try to
show younger children the excitement of crystallography. Since I am not a
teacher myself I did not want to limit this discussion, merely to ask BCA
members what they thought should be done.

We clearly have a problem with the image of crystallography as portrayed by
the National newspapers and TV, phrases such as 'crystal balls' or  'crystal
clear' are  often seen, but there is rarely more technical news; David
Stuart's image of the structure of the 'foot and mouth' disease virus has
adorned recent copies of 'The Sun', but sadly not in response to how the
structure was determined. As part of the IUCr Congress in Glasgow in 1999
our Press officer issued 'news items' related to the exciting
'breakthroughs' to be reported that day. The National media paid no
attention. This ignorance extends to all walks of life, including  rather
surprisingly, some University Physics Departments which we were told, know
nothing of modern crystallography and its importance in a technological
society.  Should we worry about this?
</p>
<P>
Members of the audience thought we should, because changes in the teaching
practise in Universities mean that few now offer specialist courses in
crystallography. Most students have very few lectures devoted to the
fundamentals of crystallography as part of their undergraduate chemistry,
physics, geology or materials science courses. A disturbing trend to
'Modularisation' is also squeezing out crystallography.  The mathematical
background of undergraduates coming up to University today is lower than it
used to be. Should our 'Summer Schools' begin with remedial maths which
would help the students understand crystallographic concepts?

</p>
<P>
Modern manufacturers supply 'black boxes' with their X-ray diffractometers,
so that little details knowledge is now needed to solve a structure.
Students should be taught to realise the limitations of the methods used in
the algorithms within these 'black boxes'.  Chris Hammond, University of
Leeds, thought that we should put greater emphasis on the understanding of
symmetries in two dimensional patterns; he finds materials science students
who really understand plane groups have much less trouble with the 3D space
groups.  Phil Withers, University of Manchester, had suggested in his
earlier lecture that some of his striking texture patterns of materials
would make good designs for 'Liberty' fabrics. He pointed out that the
Research Councils and others now make funds available for the Public
Understanding of Science. We might seek a collaboration with Design Schools
on using crystallographic patterns for wallpapers and fabrics.  (I will
maintain a list of such funding agencies and possible projects on the BCA
web site, send me news preferably by email to bca@isise.rl.ac.uk). Guy
Orpen, University of Bristol, thought we should emphasise the excitement of
discovery in crystallography, he still remembers an old 'BBC TV Horizon'
program on the discovery of the structure of DNA.  BCA members are not
skilled film makers, but granting agencies such as the Wellcome Foundation
are currently calling for collaborative projects between scientists and film
makers to bring bio-medical dramatisations to live acting or video or film. 
Please send me news of any dramatisations or novels about crystallographers.

The consensus on educating secondary school children was that we should try
to get  some crystallography into special training courses for teachers;
these are often run in school holidays by organisations such as the
Institute of Physics, The Royal Society of Chemistry (R.S.C) and the EPSRC.
The teachers attending these courses tend to be the more enthusiastic ones,
hopefully, they will go back to their schools and spread the word to their
colleagues. Sometimes they write in to say how much they enjoyed these
courses, we might publish such letters in 'Crystallography News'. Please let
me know details of such 'Update' courses, and your ideas of what
crystallography should be in them. </p>

Harry Powell described the 'Crystal Growing' projects organised by Phil
Smith of the R.S.C. in the Thames Valley area. The crystals were on display
upstairs in the commercial exhibition for members to see. Judging was to
take place later during this meeting.  Many schools enjoy these
competitions. Others are less enthusiastic because 'Crystals' do not form
part of the National Curriculum. There is a 'Materials' section, where we
might try to insert a little about crystals. Does anyone know how we might
get changes in the National Curriculum?   Young children enjoy growing
crystals and become very enthusiastic about it because it is something they
can do for themselves. The same sense of wonder can be generated by models
of crystals as you can on the faces of the children in the photographs which
accompany the article about <a href="HalfT.html">half term activities </a>
in the Oxford University
Museum (published in the December issue).    </p>

<P>
There was general agreement that we should make more interesting pages on the BCA web site for the general public.  We can try to make  'Picture Galleries' ourselves or can link to others who may have more resources that we have to make the images.   Although photographs of beautiful crystals are needed, we should try to include additional information about the structure of the crystal, and probably allow people to rotate the structures over the web.   Please send me news of any good websites and your ideas of what the BCA should be doing to improve the UK education in crystallography.</p>
