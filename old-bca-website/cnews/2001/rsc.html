<h2> <I>Royal Society of Chemistry</I> Chemical Landmarks program<BR>
</h2>
<HR>
<P>
Since 1997 the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) has collaborated with the
American Chemical Society of a series of International Historic Chemical
Landmarks to recognise sites where important work or discoveries in the
chemical sciences has been carried out, honour them with a plaque and
presentation ceremony and bring them to the attention of the public and the
media. <P> Three of these 'International Historic Chemical landmarks' have
so far been awarded. <UL>
 <LI>24 Nov 1997 at <strong>SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceutical, Harlow
        </strong><BR>
<em>&nbsp;'The discovery of histamine H2-receptor antagonists'</em>
 <LI>19 Nov 1999 at <strong>The Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum, 
London</strong>
<BR> <em> &nbsp;'The discovery and development of penicillin 1928 - 1945'</em>
 <LI>7 Aug 2000 at <strong>Bowood House, Calne, Wiltshire&nbsp;</strong><BR>
<em>' The discovery of oxygen' by Joseph Priestley</em>
</UL>
<P>
Booklets were produced to celebrate the dedication of these landmarks; 
they are available from Tracey Wells at the RSC Tel: +44 (0) 20 7440 3317

<P>
Following the success of these events, the RSC has now initiated its own
National Historic Chemical Landmarks programme. Criteria have been drawn up
for the Selection of these landmarks and the Society's Local Sections (35
groups of members arranged geographically in the UK and Ireland) have been
invited to nominate sites of interest.

<P>
On 21 March 2001 a plaque to commemorate <em>'Pioneering work in platinum
research</em>' was dedicated at the <strong>Johnson Matthey Technology
Centre, Sonning Common, Reading.</strong> <BR>

A report of the dedication of the one commemorating the work of Dorothy
Hodgkin appears later in this newsletter.  A third will be dedicated  in
November 2001 as part of celebrations for National Chemistry Week.

<BR> Report
on the Presentation of the Royal Society of Chemistry Landmark 
<BR> to Commemorate the Work of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin 
<BR> 14 May 2001</strong>
<HR> 

<P> On 14 May 2001 the Lecture Room of the University Natural History
Museum, Oxford was full of people eagerly anticipating the presentation of
the second UK Royal Society of Chemistry landmark. The proceedings were
chaired by Professor Graham Richards, Chairman of the Department of
Chemistry in the University of Oxford. The Vice-Chancellor of thestudents, Professor Sir Tom Blundell, FRS, then spoke on <BR>
<em>"Structural Biology and Crystallography today: 
the influence of Dorothy Hodgkin on current developments". </em> 
(Reported later in this issue)
<P>
In introducing the speaker, Graham Richards reminisced that he and Tom had
been undergraduates together at Brasenose College, and now Tom was Dorothy's
second most famous student. (the most famous being Margaret Thatcher (nee
Roberts) who later abandoned chemistry for law and became Prime Minister).

Professor Tony Ledwith of the Royal Society of Chemistry then presented a
memorial plaque to Professor Richards who received it on behalf of the
University.  Since Oxford weather is unpredictable, a virtual unveiling was
projected on the screen. We saw crimson velvet curtains slowly open to
reveal the plaque.

<strong>National Historic Chemical Landmark</strong><BR>
The work of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin at the University of Oxford
<P>
<em>"In this building from 1956-1994 and at other times in the Oxford
Science Area, Professor Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910-1994) OM, FRS, Nobel
Laureate, led pioneering work on the structures of antibiotics, vitamins and
proteins, including penicillin, Vitamin B<SUB>12</SUB> and insulin using
X-ray diffraction techniques. Many methods for solving crystal structures
were developed taking advantage of digital computers from the very earliest
days. The work provided a basis for much of present day molecular structure
driven molecular biology and medicinal chemistry."</em>

the wall on the archway of the main entrance to the Inorganic Chemistry
Laboratory in South Parks Road.

<strong>   "Structural Biology and Crystallography today:<BR>
     the influence of Dorothy Hodgkin on current developments"</strong>
<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
    Professor Sir Tom Blundell FRS<BR>
   Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge
<P>
Professor Blundell considered four aspects of her work:
<P>
<ol>
 <li> The legacy of her work with J.D.Bernal: protein crystals, enzyme active 
sites and drug design<BR>
 <li> The influence of insulin: anomalous scattering, polypeptide hormones, 
biologicals.<BR>
 <li> Defining new goals, receptors, multi-protein complexes and cell 
biology<BR>
 <li> Defining chemical structure by X-ray analysis: Vitamin B12, modern high 
throughput crystallography and drug discovery
</ol>
</p>
<P>
He began by describing her early work in Cambridge with her Ph.D supervisor,
J.D.Bernal, on determining the structure of protein crystals using X-rays.
In 1934 she took high quality X-ray photographs of the crystalline protein
pepsin, having realised that the crystals had to be kept in their mother
liquor if they were to retain their order. The study of proteins in water
has been immensely important over the years. The final paragraph of the
paper in Nature which she and Bernal published demonstrates remarkable
foresight.
</p>
<P>
<em>"At this stage such ideas are merely speculative, but now that a
crystalline protein has been made to give X-Ray photographs, it is clear
that we have the means of checking them by examining the structures of all
crystalline proteins, arriving at far more detailed    conclusions about
protein structure than previous physical or chemical methods have been able
to give."</em>
</p>
<P>
Pepsin proved to be a member of a large family of proteolytic enzymes called
the aspartic proteinases which have been extensively studied since then.
They have about 320 amino acids and 2 motifs of Asp-Thr-Cly at the active
site.  Charles Bunn was one of the first to work on rennin which was also
found to be an aspartic proteinase containing this same motif; it is
involved in the inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis, and may be a
possible target for  better drugs to reduce high blood pressure. 
</p>
<P>
Pepsin has an extended deep active site and drug companies began to think
about discovering drugs to fit it. In the 1980s chemistry dominated drug
design, X-ray crystallography was traditionally used to model the 3D
structures. Knowledge of the structure allows the design of structure based
inhibitors but more recently it has proved cheaper to generate
anti-hypertensive drugs using genomics.
</p>
<P>
The pepsin motif, Asp-Thr-Cly,  was also identified in 1985 in the
retroviral genomes of RSV and HIV, published by Toh H et al. in<em>
Nature</em> <strong>315,</strong> 691 (1985). Studies of the life cycle of
HIV and the structure of HIV proteinase led to the production of the drug
'Indinavar', an HIV proteinase inhibitor. The 3D structure of the HIV
proteinases was discovered in 1989 but later mutations were found to have
occurred, so cocktails of inhibitors had to be used to improve the treatment
of AIDS.
</p>
<P>
Pre-clinical Drug design now has a new paradigm since the publication of Complete Genomes in the public databases in December 2000.

Dorothy's interest in people led her to work on the structure of insulin,she
felt she had to find the structure of insulin before a cure could be found
to save children dying from early onset diabetes.

Notice that all of these illustrations exhibit 3 fold symmetry.

This structure was published by Adams, M.J., Blundell, T.L, Dodson, G.G, Dodson,E, Vijau, M, and Hodgkin D.C et al. in  <em>Nature<strong> </strong></em><strong>224</strong>, 491-495 (1969). It made us think about biology in a more general way: Dorothy was not satisfied by just knowing the structure she wanted to know how the insulin carried out its function in the body. Fred Sanger showed her a model of the insulin receptor binding which she admired but was not satisfied with just knowing the structure she had to understand how the insulin behaved in the body.<BR>

She asked 'How does it work?' No one could answer that question then;
despite more recent work by Hubbard and Hendrickson in 1995 and work by
Louise Johnson on the structure of phosphorylase we still cannot answer
Dorothy's simple question.</p>

<P>
Traditionally, laboratory X-rays were used to determine the structure of
proteins and their 3D structures modelled. Today more powerful synchrotron
radiation sources are mostly used.  Structural biology is now being applied
to aid pre-clinical drug discovery to find cures for diseases caused by
stray mitogenic activity, and those involved in cell development,
proliferation and differentiation.  Modern computers, and new algorithms
using a drug like virtual library now speed up the process of screening new
drugs more effectively.  Dorothy would have enjoyed using these, she always
tried to use the latest equipment in her research.
</p>
<P>
Perhaps Dorothy Hodgkin's most important influence was the way she worked
and interacted with people; although she collaborated with many who worked
in industry, she never thought of this as collaborating with a faceless
industry, but rather as working with her friends who happened to be employed
by an industrial company. Her students learnt the importance of a large
network of contacts to successful research.   </p>
