<h2>DARTS - The National Synchroton Radiation Service upgrade</h2>
<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>NEWS FOR SMALL MOLECULE CRYSTALLOGRAPHERS<BR>STATION 9.8 IS NOW AVAILABLE 
VIA DARTS <BR>
<P align=left>
Based at the CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, the DARTS data collection service
using synchrotron radiation (SR)  has now been available to academic users
for a year. The purpose of this EPSRC-funded service is to provide access to
SR data, using a wide range of techniques (including powder diffraction,
reflectivity, small and wide angle scattering and X-ray absorption
spectroscopy), to academics who are inexperienced in its use and
applications.  The range of samples investigated using the service
demonstrates the versatility of the facility: for example, we have looked at
samples of pharmaceutical interest, thin films, whale bones, zirconia
pigments and transition metal nitrides. 

<P align=left>
For the period February - September 1999, the service is to be extended to
incorporate single crystal diffraction using the microcrystal facility on
station 9.8 of the SRS. This station specialises in single crystal
diffraction from small or weakly scattering samples and has been widely used
by industrial DARTS customers since the inception of the service. It should
be noted that this service <em>should not</em> be regarded as a direct
alternative to the national crystallography service run by Prof. M.
Hursthouse - evidence must be included with applications to show that
laboratory-based diffraction methods are unsuitable for the proposed
research.

<P align=left>
Academic access to the service is available to any researcher eligible to
apply for research grants from EPSRC and demand for time is subject to
scientific peer review with users being able to apply at any time. The
service is intended to support those inexperienced in the use of SR
techniques; it is intended for projects that involve small scale SR use as
part of a wider research scheme or where the use of SR is likely to remain
infrequent.

<h2>CLRC News continued  -  Diamond coming soon!</h2>

<P align=left>
A series of user consultation meetings are currently taking place; they
cover all scientific disciplines to determine the ideal source parameters
for the new UK synchrotron. This is being carried out in addition to the
discussions of individual user groups. Synchrotron Radiation user opinion is
being sought regarding the really challenging experiments they wish to
undertake in the physical and biological sciences. This process will
continue eventually from the source into the design of beam lines and
optics. 

<P>
The final decision regarding site has yet to be made but is expected very
soon!

<h1>Workshop on Biological Sciences and Neutron Scattering</h1>
<hr>
<p align=left>A workshop to promote the use of neutron scattering for
the UK Biochemistry, Biological and Biotechnology research community was
held at Coseners House, Abingdon on the 9/10 November 1998. Sponsored by the
CLRC&#146;s ISIS pulsed  neutron facility at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory, it attracted some 49 participants from a range of university
departments, including Biochemistry, Biophysics, Pharmacy,  Veterinary
Science, other specialist centres (e.g. Wellcome Trust Centre for
Cell-Matrix Research), Industry (Glaxo-Wellcome, Roche), and representatives
from the BBSRC.</p>

<p align=left>The meeting focussed on the applications of neutron reflectivity,
small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and diffraction in biomolecular
sciences, pharmacy and food science. A series of excellent talks on the
study of surfaces and interfaces of biological relevance and interest and of
membranes by specular neutron reflectivity, macromolecular complexes by
SANS, low resolution crystallography and high resolution crystallography
relevant to pharmaceutical applications illustrated the potential of the
neutron scattering technique. The talks stimulated lively discussion, and
the evening dinner on the 9<sup>th</sup> provided ample opportunity for
extended discussion and interaction.

<p align=left>Professor Steve Perkins (Royal Free and University College
Medical School) is seen describing the structure of the immunoglobulin A
antibodies, 1gAl, and 1gGl. Immunoglobulin A is an abundant antibody class
that mediates immune protection  at mucosal surfaces as well as in blood.
The monomeric lgAl isotype is abundant in plasma, and contains two
four-domain Fab fragments joined by two 23-residue glycosylated hinges to a
Fc fragment. However the overall arrangement of these fragments is not
known.</p>

Steve Perkins (Royal Free Hospital) and Peter Timmins (ILL) highlighted the
applications of SANS in the study of the conformation of proteins, viruses
and other macromolecular complexes in solution and for low resolution
crystallography on surfactant-protein complexes. Athene Donald (Cambridge)
demonstrated the complementarity of X-rays and neutrons in the study of
complex food related systems, where SANS was used to monitor the
distribution and role of water in the breakdown of starch granules during
&quot;cooking&quot; (gelatinisation).

<p align="center"><img SRC="persci.gif" alt="data plot"></p>

        <p align="left">Steve Perkins (Royal Free) and his collaborators
Professor M A Kerr and Dr J M Woof (Dundee) have used neutron and x-ray
small angle scattering to determine the average solution structure. The
figure shows the 100 best-fit solution structures, which show that the two
Fab fragments are widely separated from each other relative to the Fc
fragment. Such a structure readily accounts for the binding of lectins to
the 1gAl hinge, and suggests that lgAl may have a distinct immune role in
targeting widely-spaced epitopes with which immunoglobulin 9 cannot
react.</p>

<p align=left>Bob Thomas (Oxford) showed how neutron reflectivity in 
combination with
 H/D isotopic substitution (the ability to manipulate refractive index or
&quot;contrast&quot; being a recurring theme and an important feature of the
neutron scattering technique has revealed at modest resolution some
important aspects (the nature of the packing and the extent of solvent
penetration into the protein layer) of the structure of protein, adsorbed at
the air-water and liquid-solid interfaces. Thomas Bayerl (Wurzburg) showed
how the same experimental approach can be used to study protein-membrane
interactions. Using data from both SANS and neutron reflectivity, David
Barlow (Kings College, London) discussed the design of surface-active
molecules for drug-delivery applications, and the need for detailed
structural information of such molecules at interfaces and in aggregates.<br>

<p align=left>
Joe Zaccai (ILL) showed how both diffraction and inelastic scattering can
provide a detailed insight into the structure of model membranes. Chris
Frampton (Roche), from a commercial perspective, described how highly
detailed neutron single crystal measurements in combination with X-ray data
provide important information about hydrogen positions and charge density
distributions in small molecules of pharmaceutical relevance.</p>

<p align=left>Many of the participants took the opportunity to see the
facilities at ISIS. The meeting concluded with a discussion session chaired
by Tony Watts (Oxford, and focussed on issues such as the facilities
available and the possible modes of access to the facility via the BBSRC.
The meeting successfully identified a number of areas within the broad BBSRC
remit that are ripe for exploitation, and fruitful discussions are expected
to ensue. It was clear to all that there was much potential for expansion of
the biological sciences use of ISIS, and the BBSRC (through David White,
Colin Miles and Marlie MacLean) were keen to monitor progress.</p>

 <p align=left>Anyone requiring further information on the opportunity for the
use of ISIS in the area of biological sciences should contact Chick Wilson
(c.c.wilson@rl.ac.uk) or Jeff Penfold (j.penfold@ rl.ac.uk) at ISIS or Colin
Miles/Marlie MacLean at the BBSRC.</p>
