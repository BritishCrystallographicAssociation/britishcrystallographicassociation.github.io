<h2>Meeting report  -  Molecular Modelling: A Tool for the Modern Era</h2>
<HR>

<P>
This meeting was held in The Robin Brooke Centre of St.Batholomews's
Hospital, Smithfield, London on 14th December 1998. About 100 delegates,
including many students, attended this useful overview of the methods of
molecular modelling and review of academic and industrial applications. It
was organised by the Industrial Physical Chemistry Group within the
Industrial Affairs Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Nick Quirke (Imperial College) explained that although reality is complex we
have to make simplifying assumptions to make any progress in the field. An
early method was to consider molecules as hard spheres and to model the
force between them in terms of a potential made up of two parts, a long term
attraction and a hard core repulsion. Liquids contain many thousands of
molecules, to simulate the liquid properties one takes an ensemble of many
molecules in all possible configurations weighted by the probability of that
configuration occuring. Clearly using more molecules in the simulation gives
a closer approximation to reality but takes more computing time. Since each
molecule experiences a similar force to its neighbours the calculation for
each one is identical to that for the next, making this an ideal problem for
a parallel computer. In Monte Carlo methods each molecule is perturbed from
its original position by a small amount and the energy of whole system
calculated. By choosing those configurations which have lower energy one
hopes to eventually arrive at an equilibrium.  Molecular dynamics can be
calculated by considering how the ensemble behaves over time. The first
papers in this field were published in the 1950s, and a reference list is
given at the end of this report. people are now attempting the simulations
of surface wetting, including the addition of particulates to polymers
during production, where it is essential for wetting to take place.

Dominic Tildesley, Unilever, spoke on atomistic and mesoscale modelling in
an industrial environment. At Port Sunlight they simulate the materials, the
chemical processing plants and the supply chain. He discussed the prediction
of small crystal shape in shampoos. Some crystal shapes make the shampoo
gleam more than others, which is apparently a great selling point with their
customers. (Personally, I keep my eyes shut when shampooing my hair so I
have not observed this phenomenon.) His simulations involve the prediction
of the change in morphology as dopant is added to give the desired shape.
Unilever have a large detergent manufacturing business and are working on
improving the anti-microbial properties of their products by simulations.

Richard Catlow, Royal Institution, spoke on simulations in materials
research, where they model the surface properties and large scale properties
such as the elasticity or the diffusion through structures. They have
modelled micro porous silicalite a catalyst for hydrocarbon synthesis and
also glassy materials by starting from a crystalline state and using
molecular dynamics to 'heat' the materials until it 'melts'. They are
modelling zeolites for use as catalysts and looking at how the organic
molecules 'dock' into the holes in the structure. Diagrams of zeolites can
be found  on the CD-ROM given to delegates containing Vol 19 no 5,6 (1997)
of the journal 'Molecular Simulation'. 

<P> Keith Gibbons, North Carolina State University, discussed applications
in chemical engineering including phase equilibria and confined flow, such
as that through oil pipelines and at a much smaller scale through porous
glasses used in chromatography. 

<P>
After lunch Peter Coveney, Queen Mary and Westfield College, explained the
importance of merging the atomistic scale models smoothly with those of the
mesoscale. Andrew Leach, Glaxo Wellcome, spoke of structure based library
design and use of combinatorial chemistry to simulate many chemicals during
their search for better drugs. They may simulate thousands of molecules but
few will have any biological activity; the problem is to find just those
which are worth synthesising and testing. 

<P>
Ian Gould, Imperial College, continued this theme of combinatorial chemistry
but he is applying it to modelling proteins and protein drug interactions.
He emphasised the importance of using many methods of structure
determination, X-rays, neutrons and NMR, having good visualisation tools and
the modelling of the proteins in their environment, usually water, where the
proteins are not rigid, and so are continually folding and refolding. He is
also working on the modelling of  photosynthesis in order to produce a
better type of solar cell which can use many different wavelengths of light
as plants do. <BR>David Nicolaides, MSI, talked about MesoDyn, an Esprit
project (no. 228650) a collaboration between several European partners who
are modelling lubricant flow round complex shapes. All the applications will
be in the public domain, look at the MSI website for further details of
their applications. ( <a href="http://www.msi.com">http://www.msi.com</a> )

<strong>Conclusions</strong>
<P>
The day contained a wide range of talks on a wide range of applications.
Atomistic techniques are now reaching maturity with several software codes
available.  Computer power is increasing so that such codes can be run on
the desktop. Mesoscale applications are becoming possible, but one problem
is that much of this work is not freely accessible because it is done in a
commercial environment.  It is now becoming possible to simulate
non-equilibrium problems.
