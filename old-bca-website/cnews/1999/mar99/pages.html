<h2>From the President</h2>
<HR>
 <P> As you all must
know by now, we are fast approaching the IUCr Meeting in Glasgow.
Preparations for this major scientific event are well in hand now, and
already the signs are that the attendance will be very large indeed. So I
urge you to think seriously about making plans to attend this important
meeting. This will give you a unique opportunity to welcome
crystallographers from all over the world who represent the whole vast range
of subjects that make up our discipline. Certainly the summer is going to be
a busy time for the members of the Organising and Programme Committees. If
you have not yet received your copy of the 2nd circular, please contact me
or Chris Gilmore. I look forward to seeing you all in Glasgow in August!
<P>
I am pleased to see that Dorothy Hodgkin's College Somerville is helping to
sponsor a Dorothy Hodgkin memorial lecture in The University Museum in
Oxford on March 4th to be given by Louise Johnson. Those of you who are in
Oxford at the time may like to attend. (See the Latest news page in the BCA
Web pages for details, address below)

<P>
Our activities on crystal growing, ably organised by Phil Smith of the Royal
Society of Chemistry with a little help from BCA members, are continuing. We
are hoping the national competition will be as great a success as the
regional ones.

<P>
Finally, it is with sadness that I have to announce the death recently of
Don Rogers, whom many of us remember for his important contributions to
crystallography, especially his important work on absolute configuration.

  BCA General Bursary Awards 1998</h2>
<P>
During 1998, a total of &pound;3,100 was used for BCA General bursaries and
was distributed to  nine individuals and to two block grants.  This excludes
the sum awarded for BCA bursaries to the BCA St. Andrews Conference, paid
for by the conference funds.

<h2>Royal Society News</h2>
<h3>Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships</h3>
The Royal Society is again offering 12 Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships this
year, but the deadline for applications is very close, 12 March 1999. They
offer support and flexibility to be particularly encouraging to women. They
can be held in any natural science subject, including mathematics and
engineering.  It would be good to see more fellowships being gained to study
Dorothy's own subject. Encourage any young crystallographers you know to
apply. Full details are available on the web site at :<strong>

<h3>Royal Society Journals go fully electronic</h3>
ubscribers to the Society's four main <em>Proceedings</em> and
<em>Transaction</em> journals will now benefit from direct electronic access
to their journals about two weeks before the printed copy arrives. Access
via third party 'aggregators' has been offered since September 1997; this
new service removes the need for these third party arrangements, their
passwords, and frequently, their costs. Subscribers need just to visit the
Publications web site at <a href="http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk">
http://www.pubs.royalsoc.ac.uk</a>
and register for their access.

<h3>New book on Science Funding</h3>
'<em>Science funding: the European Dimension</em>' was published in January
1999. It is the report of a Discussion meeting held at the Royal Society in
March 1998. It costs &pound;12.50 from Jacqueline Knapp, Royal Society
publications department, 6 Carlton House terrace, London  SW1Y 5AG <br>

University Bioinformatics Centre,<BR> 
<P> Professor<strong> <em>Judith
Howard</em>, </strong>(Durham) to develop chemical databases to obtain
information on molecular interactions of importance to drug design, polymer
structure and liquid crystal formation, <BR>
 Professor <strong><em>Maria Petrou</em></strong>, (Surrey) to support research in image processing
techniques to reduce exposure to X-rays during medical diagnosis,<BR>
