Many thanks are due to Phil Lightfoot and the rest of the St. Andrews team 
for their successful handling of the meeting, which was much better attended 
than expected, and which attracted a much larger commercial exhibition than 
planned, explaining the size of the profit. The proceeds from this meeting 
are being specifically used to fund the BCA bursary scheme for the Glasgow 
IUCr Congress.
