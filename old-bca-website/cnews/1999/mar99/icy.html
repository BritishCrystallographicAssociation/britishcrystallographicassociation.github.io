<h1>Cover Story - The Crystallographic Tourist in the Antarctic</h1>
<HR>
<P>
The photograph on the front cover shows '<em>glassy ice'  </em> near Crystal
Sound, Argentine islands; it was taken by Durward Cruickshank on 18th
January 1998.  He describes the story of his trip on the following pages.
The rough sketch map below shows the area.

<h2>Cover Story continued - The Icy Waters of Crystal Sound</h2>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>	In January 1998 I went on a cruise to the Antarctic Peninsula.  This is
the long arm which sticks out from the main Antarctic continent towards the
tip of South America.  

<P>
To join the <em>World Discoverer</em> I had to fly via Buenos Aires.   See
sketch map above.<BR>There I had a reunion with my former graduate student
Leo Becka who did splendid work in 1961 on hexamethylenetetramine at
temperatures down to 34 K - far below any temperature ever recorded in
Antarctica.

<P>
	I joined the ship at Ushuaia for the voyage south to the glaciers,
icebergs, penguins and whales.

<P>
 One day studying the charts I noticed a region called Crystal Sound off the
west coast of the peninsula. On looking more closely I recognised some
rather familiar names given to the little islands and rocks in the Sound:
Bragg, Dennison, Bernal, Fowler, Pauling, Owston, Shull, Wollan, Levy,
Peterson...There were other names less familiar to me: Kidd, McConnel,
Matsuyama, Nakaya, ...  Further south were Megaw Island, Nye Glacier and
Perutz Glacier. <BR>

 <P> 	Thanks to help from the British Antarctic Survey
and the Scott Polar Research Institute, both in Cambridge, and with some
assistance from Frank Allen and Kate Crennell,  <BR>I eventually learnt how
these bleak places got their names.  There are many thousands of topological
features in Antarctica, and in this particular area the Antarctic
Place-names Committee is the responsible British naming authority.  They
decided to use the names of pioneers in techniques which have helped in the
elucidation of Antarctic problems.  Glaciologists are obvious choices, and
within that group the names of the investigators of the structure of ice
crystals were chosen for features in Crystal Sound.

	Evidently Dr Brian
Roberts (1912-1978) handled the selection of names, which he described in an
article <em>Glaciologists and Antarctic place-names</em>, published in
<em>Ice</em> (Cambridge, 1962) <strong>9</strong>,10-18.  He lists over 100
glaciologists and their achievements e.g. 
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Perutz Glacier 67<SUP>o</SUP> 37' S, 66<SUP>o</SUP> 25' W.   
 M. F. Perutz (GB) b 1914; important studies of mechanism of glacier flow. 
 <li>Bragg Islands  66<SUP>o</SUP> 28' S, 66<SUP>o</SUP> 27' W.    
Sir W.H. Bragg (GB) 1862-1942; physicist, interpreted X-ray measurements to 
give location of oxygen atoms in structure of ice. 
 <li>Shull Rocks    66<SUP>o</SUP> 27' S, 66<SUP>o</SUP> 40' W.   C. G. Shull 
(USA) b. 1915; physicist, neutron diffraction to determine position of 
hydrogen atoms in ice. 
 <li>Nakaya Islands  66<SUP>o</SUP> 27' S, 66<SUP>o</SUP> 14' W.    
 U. Nakaya (Japan) b. 1900; physicist, investigator of structure and
 properties of single ice crystals and snow flakes.
 <li> Sadly there are no Lonsdale Islands, though Kathleen published a paper 
in 1948 with Philip Owston in <em>J. Glaciol.</em> on the crystalline 
structure
of ice.
</ul>

  Owston's <em>Acta Cryst</em>. paper of 1949 on the diffuse scattering of
X-rays by ice, which was aided by<em>Endurance</em> was trapped in the ice
at 77<SUP>o</SUP> S, only 80 miles from their intended land base.  It was
April 1916 before they struggled ashore at Elephant Island.

<P>
	The highlight of my cruise was a visit to Elephant Island.  Here most of
Shackleton's party had waited 4 winter months for rescue after Shackleton
set sail for South Georgia in a 22 foot boat.  Led by Frank Wild, they
survived in a crude hut roofed by two upturned boats.  James's notebook
describing the scene inside the exceedingly cramped shelter is on display in
the museum at the Scott Polar Institute.  Crystallographers who find his
treatise on X-ray diffraction  tough reading may be surprised by his
contribution to the camp singsongs.  The chorus to his song 'Antarctic
Architecture' ran:<BR>

<P><em>
		My name is Frankie Wild-o and my hut's on Elephant Isle,
<P>
		The wall's without a single brick and the roof's without a tile,
<P>
		Yet nevertheless, you must confess by many and many a mile,
<P>
		It's the most palatial place you'll find on Elephant Isle.<BR>
<P></em>

I viewed the 'palace' grounds in summer time.  They are a bleak rocky spit
under mountainous cliffs and a glacier with broken sea ice on both sides. 
We were unable to land.

<P>
	James' most distinguished student is well known to the BCA: Sir Aaron Klug
OM, President of the Royal Society and winner of the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1982 for his development of crystallographic electron
microscopy and the structures of nucleic acid-protein complexes.

On 18 January 1998 Durward visited the Ukrainian Antarctic station, formerly
the British Faraday station, shown on the cover of the envelope above. The
stamp (top right) also depicts the station. This is where the original
measurements were made which discovered the hole in the ozone layer.  These
were done using the uv spectrometer shown below.
