<BR><strong>CLRC news and IUCr satellite meetings<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
The Daresbury Laboratory is hosting an IUCr satellite meeting on the
'<strong><em>Production and utilisation of synchrotron radiation for
structural studies of matter </em>' </strong>from 1st to 4th August 1999;
the program for the meeting is on a later page of this newsletter; a
registration form is enclosed for your convenience.  Colin Carlile of the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is organising a satellite meeting in Oxford
on the '<strong><em>Structure and dynamics of molecular and Ionic solids
using neutrons</em></strong>' from 1st to 3rd August 1999. Further details
of both meetings can be found on the WWW on the 
<a href="../../meets/bcas.html">BCA meetings pages</a>.

meetings follows in this issue:

<strong>Funding for ISIS Instrument upgrades</strong>
<P>
The EPSRC have recently funded major upgrades to the High Resolution Powder
Diffractometer (HRPD) and the Single Crystal Diffractometer (SXD) at the
ISIS pulsed neutron source at CLRC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  The HRPD
improvement involves the building of a much larger 90&deg; detector bank,
which will be of great benefit in studies of more complex structures such as
zeolites and in magnetic powder diffraction studies.  On SXD, the instrument
will be essentially rebuilt, with an array of 11 position-sensitive area
detectors surrounding the sample, allowing for the study of larger unit cell
materials and smaller crystals. Work on both upgrades will begin shortly. 
Also funded by EPSRC is a new instrument for engineering stress measurements
using the neutron strain-scanning technique.  The successful ENGIN-X
proposal was a collaboration headed by scientists from the Open University.

<BR>The Sixth Oxford <strong>Summer School in Neutron Scattering
</strong>will take place at Mansfield College, Oxford from September 13th to
23rd 1999.  It aims, by lecture and tutorial, to give a complete overview of
neutron scattering over a 2 week period and is directed towards Ph.D
students and post-docs.  There are bursaries available, but numbers are
strictly limited to 40 participants.

<p><b>The PEARL High Pressure Facility at ISIS - HiPr</b></center>

<p>
<hr ALIGN="RIGHT">
<p>The PEARL High Pressure Facility, HiPr, is a medium
resolution neutron time-of-flight powder diffractometer designed to take
full advantage of the capabilities offered by the Paris-Edinburgh pressure
cell. Over the past decade this breakthrough in high-pressure technology has
extended the pressure range available for neutron studies by almost a full
order of magnitude. Funded by the EPSRC and constructed as a result of a
close collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Paris VI and ISIS, HiPr is now available to the general ISIS user
community.

<p>
HiPr
is located on the PEARL beamline, which it shares with the dedicated engineering
science facility (ENGIN). From the outset HiPr was designed to maximise
the quality and quantity of information that could be collected from a
given sample. As a consequence, the instrument permits the routine use
of two scattering geometries. For the standard ‘transverse’ geometry the
incident beam passes through the front anvil of the pressure cell and diffraction
data are collected over the angular range 83<sup>o</sup>&lt;2<font face="Symbol">q</font>&lt;97<sup>o</sup>,
providing a useful d-spacing range of ~0.5&lt;d&lt;4.2 &Aring; at a resolution
of <font face="Symbol">d</font>d/d~0.8 %. The
alternate ‘longitudinal’ geometry, in which scattering takes place within
the plane of the gasket, permits data collection from 2<font face="Symbol">q</font>=30<sup>o</sup>
(useful for long d-spacings) up to 2<font face="Symbol">q</font>=150<sup>o</sup>
(for relatively high resolution). Typical run times for refineable data
range from 15 minutes for strongly scattering samples up to several hours
for poorly scattering or structurally complex systems. At the time of writing,
the CLRC high pressure programme at ISIS is able to offer routine operation
over the pressure and temperature ranges 0-10 GPa (using tungsten carbide
anvils) and 80-300 K, respectively. Higher pressures (up to 25 GPa) may
be obtained using user-supplied sintered diamond anvils.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Despite the recent fully commissioned status of HiPr,
the list of completed and prospective high pressure structural studies
is already impressive and wide-ranging. Examples include studies of ice
phases VII and VIII, the ammonia hydrates, copper (II) oxide, iron sulphide,
cobalt deuteroxide, chalcopyrite, calcite and chlorite. The Paris-Edinburgh
collaboration also continues to go from strength to strength, with an extensive
instrument development and science programme.

pressure neutron diffraction may be obtained from the ISIS Instrument Scientist
