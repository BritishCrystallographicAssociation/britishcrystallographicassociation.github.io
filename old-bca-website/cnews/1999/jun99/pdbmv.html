<BR>News from the ACA - <B>The Protein Data Bank has a New Home<BR></B>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>On October 1, 1998 the <B>Research Collaboratory for Structural
Bioinformatics (RCSB)</B>, a consortium composed of Rutgers, the State
University of New Jersey; University of California San Diego / San Diego
Supercomputer Center (SDSC); and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), received a five-year award to manage the Protein Data
Bank (PDB). The project will run under a Cooperative Agreement from the
National Science Foundation (NSF), with funding from that agency as well as
the Department of Energy, and two units of the National Institutes of
Health: the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the National
Library of Medicine.<BR>

<P>
The RCSB has created a system with many new features; these include a
higher, faster throughput of deposited data; a greater number of query
capabilities, including more complex and more accurate queries; a uniform
archive; dynamic cross-links to other databases; and the availability of
structure and sequence neighboring. The PDB data will be stored and mirrored
at all three RCSB sites. The PDB will also be mirrored at key sites
worldwide, notably in Europe and the Pacific Rim. 

<P>
The responsibilities of the three sites have been divided according to
experience and expertise.

&#143; Principal investigator Helen Berman, a Rutgers professor of
chemistry, was part of the original team that developed the Protein Data
Bank at Brookhaven in 1971. She is responsible for the development of the
Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) at Rutgers, which assembles and distributes
structural information about nucleic acids and contains an atlas, an archive
and a sophisticated search engine to access the data. In collaboration with
John Westbrook, who has played a key role in the development of the mmCIF
dictionary, they have drawn on the experiences with the NDB and have led a
team of people who have created a new data deposition and processing system
for all macromolecules.

<P>
&#143; At the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UCSD, senior
principal scientist and adjunct professor Phil Bourne leads a group of
scientists in a Biological Data Representation and Query initiative. The
group has developed locally a number of databases containing derived data on
protein structures and maintains a mirror site of Berman's NDB. Recent work
produced a database of structure comparisons for the more than 8,000
structures currently in the PDB. Together with Peter Arzberger, a
computational biologist and Executive Director of NPACI, this group will be
responsible for all aspects of data query and distribution.

<P>
&#143; Gary L. Gilliland, chief of the Biotechnology Division in NIST's
Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory, will lead the NIST effort. He
has maintained an active research program in protein crystallography for
more than 20 years. Gilliland also played a key role in establishing the
Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology (CARB), a joint effort of NIST
and the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, where he served as
the Associate Director until 1996. Phoebe Fagan, who has worked for many
years in the NIST Standard Reference Data program, is responsible for the
technical aspects of the project at that site. NIST will establish data
uniformity of the old and new structures in order to improve the
accessibility and reliability of queries and will also manage the Master
Archive.

<P>
The RCSB is working with the Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) team
that is headed by Joel Sussman to ensure that there is a seamless transition
that will be completed by October 31, 1999. Thus, all aspects of data
deposition, data processing, and distribution will be slowly phased in.
Starting in January 1999, data will be deposited through BNL via AUTODEP and
processed by the RCSB. In the spring, the RCSB deposition tool will be made
available as an alternative. By the end of the transition period all
depositions will go directly to the RCSB. The current structure of the ftp
site and the Web site as maintained by BNL will remain in place during this
year. New query capabilities will be introduced by RCSB in three stages. The
first tool, called SearchLite, will be introduced in February 1999. By
October 1999, the full capabilities of the system including structure
comparison will be publicly available.

<P>
A web site has been established to provide up to date transition information
and to provide access to the new features of the system as they become
available.
