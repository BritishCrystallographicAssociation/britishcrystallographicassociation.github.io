<B>Crystal Healing - the art of using X-ray crystallography in the search 
for new drugs.<BR></B>Inaugural lecture by Prof. Garry L. Taylor at 
Bath University, 22nd April 1999.<BR>
<HR>
<P>
Garry began by reassuring the audience that he wouldn't be talking about
"energy medicine", he showed a book on the subject, whose title he'd
borrowed,  which suggested that for the stress he was feeling at that moment
he should be lying on the floor with a quartz crystal on his solar plexus.
He found listening to Mozart was more effective!  The healing he'd be
describing came from designing drugs against proteins whose structures were
much more complicated than quartz and which did not crystallise naturally.

After this introduction the talk was in three sections, the first describing
what proteins are, then moving on to crystallography and finally on to the
sialidase<I> </I>class of enzymes and drug design. In the protein section
Garry described the relative sizes of cells, viruses and proteins, explained
secondary structure motifs and how the pictures protein crystallographers
use relate to the atoms in the structure.

<P>
In the crystallography part Garry started by explaining why we need X-rays
and crystals to investigate protein structure rather than an ordinary
visible light microscope. A brief history of crystallography followed,
starting with the Braggs'  NaCl in 1915, moving on to the 1962 Nobel prizes
for DNA, myoglobin and haemoglobin; then the infamous report of Dorothy
Hodgkin's 1964 Nobel prize going to a "British wife" for the structures of
penicillin, Vitamin B12 and insulin. The first enzyme structure, lysozyme,
was solved by David Phillips in 1965. 
<P>
Following these introductory sections Garry moved on to work that has been
done on the sialidases. Sugars on the surfaces of cells commonly terminate
in one called sialic acid and the<I> </I>sialidase enzymes exist to remove
this sugar. Garry concentrated on case studies of sialidases from four
different organisms. The best studied is that from influenza, the structure
was solved in Australia. From knowledge of the active site, compounds were
designed to bind more tightly than the natural sialic acid and thus
hopefully could be used as drugs against all strains of influenza, relieving
us from the necessity of annual vaccinations. Garry used the equivalent
enzyme from a paramyxovirus, Newcastle Disease virus, to illustrate the
structure solution process. To solve this structure required more than 500
crystals, 150 derivative data sets, 5000000 X-ray intensities and five years
of work. While he talked we began to hear music which gradually became
louder and as the structure was solved Garry became inaudible under the
waves of Wagner's <I>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</I> crashing around the
lecture theatre.
 
<P>
Next came the structure of a sialidase from <I>V. cholerae,</I> the
bacterium which causes cholera. This enzyme has extra domains to enable it
to hang around in the fast-flowing environment of the small intestine.
Finally the story of the South American <I>trypanosome</I> which affects 80
million Latin American people. It has a sialidase enzyme which removes the
sialic acid from the host cells to add to its own, helping to disguise it
from the immune system. It is an attractive target for drug design; Garry's
research group are trying to crystallise this enzyme. <P> In his concluding
remarks Garry made the point that this was only one class of enzymes, the
vast genome sequencing effort round the world is opening up a mine for drug
companies looking for attractive targets. Finally he thanked his family and
research group for their help and support.<BR>
