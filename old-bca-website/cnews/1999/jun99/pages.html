<h2>From the President</h2>
<HR>
 The Glasgow Congress is now fast approaching, and with over 2400 abstracts
in at the time of writing, this really does promise to be a major event for
all of us. We can certainly expect to be meeting huge numbers of our
colleagues from abroad, and I hope they will have an opportunity to visit
many of the laboratories in the UK and see for themselves the high level of
science carried out. If you have not yet registered for the Congress, please
do so as soon as possible. This is a once in a lifetime experience for many
of us!!

<P>
You will recall the long saga about our category of membership of the IUCr
and the Royal Society <a href="../dec98/pages.html#pres">
(see issue 67, Dec 98)</a>. I am pleased to announce that
after negotiation, The Royal Society has agreed to consider the BCA as the
'Adhering Body to the IUCr' at category 5 level, as we had requested. In
addition they will eventually pay up to 49% of the membership fee, dropping
to this level over a reasonable period of time. The Council of the BCA is
grateful to the Royal Society for understanding our position on this.

<P>
I have great pleasure in announcing that we have some new Honorary life
members of the BCA, Arnold Beevers, R.C. Evans and Terry Willis. Arnold is
well known to us, not only for his crucial early work on structure
determination, culminating in the famous Beevers-Lipson's strips, but also
for developing the ubiquitous Beevers crystal models, and much more! Bob
Evans will be familiar especially to those of us who recall the early days
of the IUCr. Bob played a major role in establishing the Union as its first
General Secretary and in setting up the journal Acta Crystallographica (see
the IUCr website for full details). Terry Willis is principally known for
his work on neutron scattering and on thermal vibrations. He also organises
a regular neutron diffraction summer school, sponsored by the BCA.

<P>
Let me end on a sad note. You will all be aware that recently Professor
David Phillips FRS  (Lord Phillips of Ellesmere) died at the age of 74 after
a long illness. David was the first President of the BCA, and Chairman of
the Advisory Board for the Research Councils. <BR>The culmination of his
scientific career was the determination of the structure of lysozyme. He was
a multitalented person, even helping to bring science to millions of
children with the television programme, '<I>Which Came First, the Chicken or
the Egg'</I>. I am sure he will be missed by all of us.

<h2>100 years of the American Physical Society</h2>
In the May 1999 issue of '<I>Physics World'</I> there is a report of how 
the <B>American Physical Society celebrated its 100th anniversary</B> 
with a Centennial Celebration in Atlanta, Georgia. They unveiled a set of 
posters highlighting 100 years of progress in physics.  
<BR>This 'physics timeline' can now be seen on the WWW at the URL

<B>Mineralogy Database</B>
<P>
David Barthelmy has set up a mineralogy database on the WWW containing more 
than 5000 pages of mineral data, and 3,968 individual mineral descriptions
 with links at 
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<B><a href="http://web.wt.net/~daba/Mineral/">
http://web.wt.net/~daba/Mineral/</a></B>
<P>
Mineral data on individual species are closely HTML linked to a table by
crystallography, chemical composition, physical and optical properties,
Dana's new classification, Strunz classification and alphabetical listings
of mineral species. The site also has pictures of minerals in the author's
collection and links to other WWW sites with mineral data. The pages can be
displayed using the English languages or any one of 5 others.

<B><BR>News from NCUACS <BR>the National Cataloguing Unit for the Archives of Contemporary Science<BR></B>
<HR>
<P>
Among other supplements to collections catalogued recently are those of
<B>Sir John Kendrew</B>, (Nobel prize, Chemistry, 1962) and the biochemist
and historian of science in China, Joseph Needham. Paper catalogues may be
purchased from the Unit, write for prices to: NCUACS, The University of
Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2  7AY

<P>
Newly received for cataloguing at Bath are the papers of <B>Dame Kathleen
Lonsdale</B>, who in 1945 was one of the first two women to be elected to
the Fellowship of the Royal Society.

<P>
The Unit has completed its pilot project to mount the full text of its
catalogues of the papers of <B>Cambridge biochemists</B> on the World Wide
Web, and is now assessing the benefits of the project and considering how it
might best be taken forward.

<P>
The unit is collaborating on a CASE project, Co-operation on the Archives of
Science in Europe, and has set up a 
<a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/Centres/NCUACS/case.htm"> 
web site with links</a> to science and
technology archives in ten European countries.

<H2>The EPSRC National Crystallography Service</h2>

<P>
The EPSRC National Crystallography Service is now fully established and
operational in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southampton.
Housed in the new Synthetic Chemistry Building, the Service now offers
'state of the art' facilities and instrumentation, thus providing excellent
crystallographic services. <br>

<P> Working on the Service, under the
directorship of Prof. Mike Hursthouse, are three post-docs, Simon Coles,
Mark Light and Thomas Gelbrich, in addition to a part-time administrator,
Ann Egan. The Service offers data collection or structure solution on
samples ranging from the relatively straight-forward to the extremely
problematic, with further flexibility to perform non-routine experiments on
demand. <br>

<P> Data are collected using a Nonius KappaCCD Area detector at the
window of a Nonius FR591 rotating Mo anode generator. The detector routinely
operates in a thick slice 'image plate' mode, which offers significant
reductions in data collection time over the thin slicing method and is
proving to be very successful in the integration of otherwise suspect
diffraction patterns. This, coupled with the increased power of the
generator (max. 50kV, 100mA, 5kW) and heightened sensitivity of the detector
also allows us to examine very small (&lt; 50mm) and weakly diffracting
crystals. The flexibility of Kappa geometry allows us to collect data in a
variety of arrangements. Multiple recording of reflections from several
scans is a routine part of our standard procedure, which ensures very high
quality data with good redundancy and completeness. An Oxford Cryosystems
cryostream enables data collection in the 90-350K temperature range,
allowing sensitive samples to be investigated. <br>

<P> Available for those
eligible to seek funding from the EPSRC Chemistry Program, the Service is
now able to offer you higher quality data, or structures, within a shorter
time-scale, together with work on more demanding crystals. The ability to
work with small crystals makes this facility an ideal intermediary between
conventional, sealed tube diffractometers and the more powerful, but
expensive, single crystal diffraction equipment available at synchrotron
radiation sources.

<P>
Full details of the operation of this service and making an application for
an allocation may be found on our website
