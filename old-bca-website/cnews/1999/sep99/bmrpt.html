Report on - MINERALOGY OF CERAMICS: ANCIENT AND MODERN<BR>
</B>
<HR>

The programme for this one day meeting at the Mineralogical Society in June
1999 was a full one, with thirteen oral presentations and nine posters,
covering ceramic science from ancient bricks to modern dielectric ceramics
for the telecoms industry. The aim of the meeting was to bring together
those interested in using mineralogical methods of analysis to characterise
the nature and behaviour of ceramic materials.

<P>
The programme of talks was set off with a contribution from I.Freestone
(London) on the mineralogy of early British porcelain, in which the use of
materials analysis (SEM/EDXA, Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive
X-Ray Analysis)) to elucidate attempts in 18th century England to reproduce
highly valued porcelain from China were described. This was followed by
several more presentations in which SEM/EDXA and also TEM and XRD had been
used: Y. Iqbal (Sheffield) on the elucidation of the mineralogy and textural
relationships in modern porcelains, M. Tite (Oxford) on the investigation of
technological innovations in the manufacture and decoration of Islamic and
Iznik pottery, and to conclude the session, a presentation by T. Pradell
(Barcelona) on investigations into the nature of tin oxide opacifiers used
in medieval tin glazes.

There was an opportunity for viewing and discussion of the poster displays
during the interval for lunch. As for the oral presentations, several of the
posters described the application of optical and electron microscopy, EDXA
and XRD:  V. Flores-Ales (Seville) on glazed tiles from Seville, F.
G&ouml;kalp (Ankara) on archaeological ceramics from the Datca Peninsular,
Turkey, L. Joyner (London) on inlays in Korean celadons, M. Mata (Zaragoza)
on the recognition of mineralogical changes during the firing of clays at
relatively low temperatures, J. Poblome (Southampton) on Roman pottery from
Sagalassos, in S.W. Asia Minor, S. Wolf (Fribourg) on the production of
large medieval bricks in Switzerland. Other contributions introduced the use
of synchrotron X-ray sources (T. Hughes and E. Pantos, Daresbury), and also
M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy (W. H&auml;usler, Munich) for the study of
archaeological ceramics.

Refractories and their development in the 20th century formed the subject of
W. Lee's (Sheffield) presentation, and this was followed by a contribution
from O. Stilborg (Lund) on refractories used in a pre-Roman iron smelting
furnace. The session continued with three accounts of mineralogical studies
of clays and archaeological pottery: B. Sherriff (Manitoba) spoke on a Roman
site in Tunisia, A. T&uuml;rkmenoglu (Ankara) considered pottery from
Malatya, Turkey, and A. Lindahl (Lund) described pottery traditions in
Zimbabwe. The final session of the day included contributions from  R. Freer
(Manchester) on the use of electron microscopy and XRD in the
characterisation of microstructure in dielectric ceramics used in the
telecoms industry, M. Pantos (Daresbury) on applications of synchrotron
radiation to the study of archaeological ceramics, and S. Santamaria Dublin)
on a study of 17th century Irish brick. The day concluded with a
presentation by C. Halls London) on Chinese kaolins, the starting point for
some of the finest ceramics ever produced and reminded us that underlying
the ceramics industry, past and present is a need for mineral raw materials,
whose distribution and availability is determined by geology.

<P>
The meeting attracted nearly sixty participants, certainly exceeding early
expectations, and thanks are due to the Mineralogical Society and other
staff who made us welcome at 41 Queen's Gate. Thanks are also due to the
Applied Mineralogy Group, who provided financial support for the meeting and
for the production of a set of abstracts [a few copies are still available
from the convenor of the meeting, Andrew Middleton,  at the address below.
]. Hopefully, the programme provided at least something for everyone, and
may have gone some way towards achieving its aim of indicating some areas of
common ground between the study of ancient and modern ceramic materials.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) photomicrographs (back-scattered electron
images, used to enhance compositional contrast) of the white inlay (darker
in micrographs) in a cross-section of a 12th century Korean celadon. The
inlay was pressed into a sharp angular incision in the body, and is covered
by a layer of glaze (white in the micrographs). The detail micrographs show
the sharp contact with the body, containing numerous, rounded bloating pores
and also the granular nature of the inlay. EDX analysis, together with XRD
have shown that the inlay was made from an impure kaolinitic clay (converted
to mullite during firing), containing quartz and alkali feldspar.
