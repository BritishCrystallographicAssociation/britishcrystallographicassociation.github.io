<h2>Proposed new beam line for the SRS </h2>
<P>
The CLRC Lab News for July 1999 reported that the EPSRC has agreed to fund a
new beamline for the SRS; costing &pound;2 million the facility should be
ready for use in 2001. The work will be carried out by the Daresbury
Laboratory in collaboration with the Universities of Aberystwyth, Cambridge,
Sheffield and Birkbeck College London. The beamline will enable scientists
to see how the molecular structure of a material changes as an industrial
process happens. The sample, for example a plastic used in packaging, is
subjected to the process, heating, cooling or stretching for example, within
the X-ray beam, and the structure determined as it changes. The facility
should enable industry to choose the most efficient and environmentally
friendly manufacturing techniques.

<I>UK-FRANCE CO-OPERATION <BR>
ON NEW SYNCHROTRON RADIATION SOURCE ANNOUNCED</I>
<P>
The French Ministry of National Education, Science and Technology announced on <BR>
2 August 1999 that the UK and French Governments have agreed to co-operate
upon the new UK SR source and its exploitation. The French commitment is for
350 MFF ( &pound;35m) over seven years for construction and 60-80 MFF (
&pound;6-8m) per annum for operations. French scientists and engineers will
be involved "in the definition and the design of the apparatus" and create a
"reception laboratory" on the UK site. No comment is made about the location
of the UK site in the French statement, other than that it is for the UK
Government to decide.  More details are given in <I>Nature  </I>Vol 400 5
Aug 1999 p 489 and '<I>Physics World'</I> Sept 1999 p7 'French fury at
synchrotron deal'.<BR>

<I>USER CONSULTATION OUTCOMES</I>
<P>
The outcome of the Life and Health Sciences user consultation exercise has
been produced by MRC. A copy can be accessed via the DIAMOND web page (URL
above)  alternatively contact Dr Mark Palmer at the MRC. The outcome of the
Physical Sciences consultation is already available on the same web site or
via Dr Fiona Wild of the EPSRC.<BR>

<P>
<I>1999 SR USER MEETING</I>
<P>
The next SR Users' meeting will be held at Daresbury Laboratory on 14-15
September. The Director General of the Research Councils (DGRC), Dr John
Taylor, is due to attend and give a presentation on future SR provision in
the UK. There will be an opportunity for discussion after his
presentation.<BR>

<P>
<B><I>Editor's Note: </I></B>These notes were summarised from the notes for
the SR user meeting sent out by the Daresbury Laboratory. The publication of
the UK location where Diamond is to be built is expected during September
1999, so you will probably know which site has been chosen by the time you
read this newsletter.

<B>Queen's Birthday Honours</B>
<P>
Congratulations to Dr Andrew Taylor, Director of ISIS since 1993, on the
award of an OBE for 'services to neutron scattering'. Other recipients of
honours included Brian Fender from the HEFCE who received a Knighthood for
'services to the University of Keele and the Higher Education Funding
Council for England' and David Phillips, head of the Department of Chemistry
at Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine who received an OBE
for 'services to science education'.

<B>From the ILL Newsletter (no. 31   June 1999)</B>
<P>
This summer, ILL welcomes its two new associate directors from France and
the UK. On 18 August 1999, <B>Dr. Colin Carlile </B>will arrive and will
take over as head of the projects and techniques division on Dr. Philippe
Leconte's departure in October. Dr. Christian Vettier replaces Professor
Alan Leadbetter, head of the science division, on 13 September 1999.

The present British associate director, Alan<BR>
Leadbetter, will retire in the UK, whereas the<BR>
French director, Philippe Leconte, will return<BR>
to CEA-Saclay in Paris. We wish them well<BR>
for the future.                                               <BR>

Currently, Colin Carlile is division head at the ISIS pulsed neutron-source
of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. Colin is an expert in the design
and exploitation of advanced neutron spectrometers. His scientific interests
are the study of diffusion and tunnelling processes using neutron
spectroscopy. Colin worked in Ispra, Italy, as a post-doc. A few years
later, he came to the ILL where he was involved in the running of IN4 and in
the design of IN6. After his return to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
he remained a regular visitor of the ILL carrying out experiments and
serving on ILL committees.

<P>
At present, Christian Vettier is group leader at the neighbouring European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF, in Grenoble, France. There, he set up
the magnetic scattering group which now forms a world centre in magnetic
x-ray scattering. During the 80s, Christian was staff scientist in the
three-axis group at the ILL. For extended periods he lived in the United
States, working at AT&amp;T Bell Labs and the National Synchrotron Light
Source in Brookhaven. After his departure to the ESRF, Christian continued
to carry out experiments at the ILL; he also was member of various ILL
committees.
