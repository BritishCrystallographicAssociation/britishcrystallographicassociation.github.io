 Report on the Bragg Lecture,<br> "Polymorphism; The Same yet Different"<BR>
Glasgow 7th August 1999</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The 1999 Bragg lecture entitled "Polymorphism: the same but different" was
given at the Glasgow IUCr Congress by Professor Jack Dunitz, ETH, Zurich.
The Chairman of the Bragg Lecture Fund Committee, Professor Tony North,
introduced the lecture by explaining to the sizeable international audience
the origin, intent, and practice of the Bragg lecture. (see page 20
'Crystallography News' 
<a href="../sep97/namel.html">no. 62 Sept 97</a>). He explained that Prof. Dunitz was a
particularly apt choice of Bragg Lecturer for this occasion both because he
was born and educated to PhD level in Glasgow and because he had
subsequently joined W.L.Bragg's group at the Royal Institution.

Prof. Dunitz began his lecture by giving two possible alternative titles: 
"Where are we today?" or "How things have changed". He felt these reflected
the change in outlook of chemists to polymorphs during his lifetime, from
the occurrence of an unwanted nuisance to a thriving research field;
mineralogists, however, had always found them interesting. Late in the
eighteenth century Ha&uuml;y had thought that there was always a one-to-one
correspondence between a compound and a particular crystal structure; in
1822 two different compounds were found to have the same crystalline form,
but it was not until over 100 years later that two different forms were
found for one compound.<BR>

<P>
Prof. Dunitz suggested that the impetus for this change of attitude came
from the challenge of crystal engineering, for example, in the
pharmaceuticals industry, and the need to predict crystal structures and
molecular properties. Chemists used to be more interested in measuring bond
lengths and angles than in the crystal structures. Today they make informed
guesses at bond lengths and use "ab initio" quantum mechanical calculations
to predict structures, but cannot yet predict why a given molecule takes up
one crystalline shape rather than another.  He observed that only 3% of the
structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) were explicitly listed
as polymorphs but that polymorphism was surely far more common than this. He
went on to discuss the nature of polymorphism in the first-order and
order-disorder transitions that allow conversion from one polymorph to
another. The higher temperature form often has a higher symmetry.   <P> <BR>
He then related the "Strange Case of the Disappearing Polymorphs" .  The
story began in 1946 with the synthesis by Todd in Cambridge, England, of a
crystalline compound,  1,2,3,5- tetra-acetylribose that showed a melting
point of 58C (form A). The same compound with the same melting point was
obtained shortly afterwards in Jena, Germany, but when prepared by a
different method the melting point was 82 C (form B) . Chemists  in New York
tried to replicate these results but could only make B, so asked for a
sample of the original crystals of A. However, when the A form reached New
York it had transformed into B, and even more mysteriously, so had the
sample left in peace on the shelf in Cambridge!.  Patterson (of the
Patterson function) obtained a sample of A and succeeded in keeping it for 7
weeks before it spontaneously turned into B. Finally in 1981 a laboratory in
Budapest, well away from any contamination of 'B' crystals in England or the
USA, succeeded in synthesising Form A again.  This ability for one
thermodynamically stable form to dominate over another polymorph can have
important implications for the pharmaceutical industry, especially when
litigation proceedings are involved. Prof Dunitz also suggested this
phenomenon may well be connected with the prion formation found in scrapie
like diseases such as BSE in cattle. 

<P>
Prof Dunitz then discussed the lattice energy of crystal polymorphs, where
Coulomb forces may be attractive or repulsive, but dispersion forces are
always attractive and increase with molecular size. He stated that in many
packing arrangements "empty space is wasted space".   He had participated in
an interesting workshop, (reported on later), where several laboratories had
tried to predict a crystal structure given only a structure diagram.  

<P>
He briefly discussed the packing coefficients of organic crystals, which are
in the range 0.65 to 0.8, while that of Kepler's conjecture of closest
packing of spheres is 0.74. He ended with his own conjecture "<I>The optimal
packing of a collection of identical molecules necessarily leads to the
densest packing</I>", that is, both periodicity <I>and</I> the crystalline
state. In this context, Kepler's conjecture, (recently shown to be true by a
computer proof ) that the densest packing of spheres is the face centred
cubic close packing is seen as a special case.

<P>
During the question period following the lecture a member of the audience
claimed to know of a counter example to the Dunitz conjecture. He said that
crystalline resorcinol  becomes amorphous at high pressures (40-60 kbar)
apparently showing that a non-periodic state can be associated with a higher
density.  The lecturer repled that of course, we do not know whether this
amorphous form of resorcinol is the densest form. As a result of hydrogen
bonding, normal resorcinol has an open structure, similar to that of ice,
and one can imagine amorphous or glassy structures, intermediate in density
between the open structure and the densest ones, which may lack hydrogen
bonds. We know that when ice melts and some of the hydrogen bonds are
broken, there is a 10% contraction in volume; one is tempted to ask what
happens at higher pressures, does another crystalline state form with an
even higher density. This lecture had enthralled the audience, many of whom
delayed their coffee break for further discussions.  <BR>

Report on Crystal Structure Prediction Workshop<br>
held at CCDC 6/7 May 1999<BR>
</h2>
<HR>
<P>
This collaborative workshop was held at the CCDC, (Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre)  on a blind test prediction of crystal
structure for 4 organic molecules for which unpublished experimental
structures were available. The purpose of the test was to get a better
insight in the merits and problems of the different existing methodologies
for crystal structure prediction. The 11 participants were invited to
propose at most three structures for each  molecule, given only the chemical
diagrams shown here:<BR>

<P>
     <IMG src="ccdcwk.gif" ALT="3 diagrams used"
 ALIGN=MIDDLE HEIGHT=107 WIDTH=559 VSPACE=2>

<P>
These structures were obtained by issuing requests to about 12 laboratories
for smallish molecules with limited flexibility, a common spacegroup and
Z<SUP>1</SUP>=1. About 20 chemical diagrams were collected from which 3 were
selected by Dr Paul Raithby ( Chemistry Dept, Cambridge) who agreed to act
as an independent referee. The diagrams were sent out in December 1998; no
experimental details were released by the laboratories until after the
closing date for submission in April 1999. The structure of propane was also
offered as an optional extra challenge.<BR>

<P>
Although no program gave consistently reliable results, there were
successful predictions for all 4 molecules from different programs, all
based on calculated lattice energy. <BR>

 7 predictions were very close to the experimental and judged as correct.
The energy based programs were MOLPAK, UPACK, MSI-PP, MPA, plus two related
<I>ab initio</I> based ones. Methods based on fitting against the Cambridge
Database (CSD) statistics were employed in programs FlexCryst, PackStar and
Rancel. These programs covered a wide range of searching techniques as well
as fitness functions.<BR>

<P>
An interesting story unfolded with compound I, which was revealed to have
two polymorphs in Pbca and P21/c, the latter appearing more stable. There
were 4 correct predictions of the meta-stable Pbca structure, none of the
other. Compound II set more of challenge as regards polar chemical groups
and H-bonding, and only one prediction was correct. Compound III had
torsional freedom and one correct solution appeared, from a program allowing
for flexibility, although the experimental phenyl torsion is only 6 degrees.
The structure of propane was only predicted by one program, which turned out
to use <I>ab initio</I> derived energy calculations.

<P>
The results are encouraging in that the success can not be considered as
just a matter of luck, but there is a long way to go before we can place
great confidence on the relative stability of calculated structures. Suppose
that I in Pbca had not been the experimental accidental finding; no program
predicted the P21/c structure which seems the more stable, and the success
rate dramatically drops from 7 to 3! The experience has given all the
participants food for thought and ideas for improvement of their methods.
There was  generally an opinion that although energy methods ( ignoring
entropy ) are presently the best we  have, there will come a time where
knowledge based functions derived from the CSD may be  useful to select the
more likely polymorphs from the surprisingly large numbers of close-packed
structures all within a few kJ of the global energy minimum.

<B>Bursary report from Erice 99</B><BR>
Crystal Engineering: from Molecules and Crystals to Materials,<BR>
 12th to 23rd May 1999, Erice, Sicily, Italy.
<HR>
<P>
<B>THE LOCATION</B>: If you ever have the opportunity to go to ERICE for a
crystallography school, GO!   The location is charming and the food arranged
so you can try a different restaurant for both lunch and evening meal.  This
lets you side-track any academic discussion, whilst enabling you too see
most of the town in the process.

<P>
<B>CONFERENCE SCOPE</B>: This year was the 25th anniversary of the
crystallography school, which was celebrated during our stay in ERICE.   The
conference organisers <I>Dario Braga </I>and <I>Guy Orpen</I> ran a program
in 3 parts, computation, synthesis and application.
  
<P>
<B>COMPUTATION</B>: The two major themes were:
<UL>
<LI><B><I>Crystal prediction</I></B>, Speakers <I>Gavezzotti, Perlstein, 
Williams, Schmidt and Erk</I>, <BR>
have developed different and complementary approaches, most of which require
a space group to initiate the search; the exception is Williams who performs
prediction using P1 on hydrocarbons, and consequently predicts space group. 
Issues raised were charges and the potentials used along with the complexity
arising from conformation.

<LI><B><I>Data mining,</I></B> <I>Taylor and Desiraju, and Orpen <BR>
</I>discussed the application of data mining to crystal engineering.   The
role of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database in locating scaffolds and
synthons for crystal engineering was highlighted. 

</UL>
<P>
<B>SYNTHESIS</B>: <I>Lehn</I> opened the meeting covering supermolecular
assemblies and the implication for molecular computation followed by
<I>Addadi </I>who covered what can be learnt from bio-mineralisation
concerning controlled nucleation and growth.  An architecture on which to
build crystal engineering was given by Aakeroy, Zaworotko, Hosseini and
Kahn, with  examples of their current work covering organic, co-ordination
polymer, co-crystal or guest-host systems.  The central issue was the
identification of durable building blocks for use in the design of
functional solids where the application dictates the features required. 
 
<P>
<B>APPLICATION</B>: The area included the application of crystal engineering
strategies to magnetic, optical, superconductors and conduction, and
highlighted the issues of how to target the correct building for the
structures.  In many cases the presentation on application naturally
overlapped with those of synthesis.  Hulliger and Bosshard discussed polar
solids; magnetic materials was covered by Miller and Gatteschi; Geiser gave
an overview of conductors.

<P>
<B>ONGOING ISSUES</B>:Two themes recurred throughout the meeting. Firstly,
how to optimise the engineering of the functional solids by improving the
way in which the screening, identification and design of synthon, motif or
scaffold of the target structure was done and move away from serendipity. 
Secondly, the lack of understanding and control over polymorphism was also
raised by many during presentations and discussion, particularly the role
played by solvent, impurities and crystallisation conditions.

<P>
<B>JOURNALS</B>: The launch of a new, purely electronic, Royal Society of
Chemistry Journal "<I>Crystal Engineering Communication</I>" was announced
and welcomed as a complement to Elsevier's existing 'Journal of Crystal
Engineering'.
