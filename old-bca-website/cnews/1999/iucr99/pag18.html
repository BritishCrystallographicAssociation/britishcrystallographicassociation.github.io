Report of the 1999 Lonsdale Lecture -<br>
 "<I>Diffuse X-Ray Scattering</I>"<BR>
T R Welberry </h2>
<HR>

<P>
The 1999 BCA Lonsdale Lecture was delivered as one of the Plenary sessions
at the XVIII IUCr Congress in Glasgow on 7 August 1999.  The Lecturer, Dr
Richard Welberry of the Australian National University,(ANU), Canberra, was
introduced by Howard Flack, a highly appropriate choice as both had been
students in Dame Kathleen's Laboratory in University College London. 
Although Richard was not himself one of Professor Lonsdale's students,
arriving to do his Ph.D. in 1967 just a year before her retirement, his
project on disorder in crystals reflected one of her long term interests. 

<P>
<BR>
The lecture began with a reference to Kathleen Lonsdale's 1948 book,
"Crystals and X-rays", which included pictures of diffuse scattering, and to
the work of Flack and Glazer in 1970 based around measurements of diffuse
scattering using Laue photographs and beginning to model this scattering. 
The measurements now being made by Richard Welberry at ANU use flat-cone
Weissenberg geometry with a Position Sensitive Detector.  Images are
typically collected in 100 crystal <FONT FACE="Symbol">w</FONT> steps which
are then combined and undistorted to produce reciprocal space images. 
Modern images such as these provide a great deal of detail in the X-ray
diffuse scattering patterns, giving the opportunity to develop detailed
methods of interpretation.

<P>
The basic framework of the methods used is a Taylor expansion of the
diffraction equation in terms of displacements of atoms from their mean
positions.  In schematic terms this expansion can be written as            
I<SUB>diff</SUB> = I<SUB>0</SUB> + I<SUB>1</SUB> + I<SUB>2</SUB> +
I<SUB>3</SUB> + ... <P>

The first three of these terms, representing correlations between pairs of
atoms, can be described most simply in the following way: <UL>

<LI>I<SUB>0</SUB> represents short range order, including the effect of occupancy correlations (e.g. the formation of clusters);
<LI>I<SUB>1</SUB> represents size effects (intuitively, larger atoms push apart, smaller ones move together) which gives a structured diffuse scattering pattern in which intensity is transferred between reciprocal lattice points;
<LI>I<SUB>2</SUB> represents a combination of TDS and Huang scattering, which correspond to the effects of dilation and shear.  These coupled motions lead to streaks in the diffraction pattern, those due to dilation point away from the origin while those due to shear are tangential to this.
</UL>
<P>
One of the difficulties in trying to interpret a diffuse scattering pattern
in terms of even a relatively straightforward expansion such as this is the
large number of terms involved.  This leads to the use of computer
simulations to aid interpretation, and building physical models to help
explain the data.<BR>

<P>
Monte Carlo simulations are the main approach now used to model diffuse
scattering.  Atoms are moved around "randomly" subject to some simple
physical model; the usual one represents "molecular" units as rigid bodies
and intermolecular forces by simple Hooke's law relationships.  Large
numbers of repeat units are required  for such simulations to reproduce the
observed diffraction pattern in sufficient detail to match the high quality
observations available.  Early use of arrays of 10 x 10 x 10 unit cells led
to seriously degraded patterns, now simulations usually have 32 x 32 x 32
unit cells.

<P>
The applications of this method were illustrated by examples from Richard's
own work:

<UL>
<LI>Alkane/urea inclusion compounds, where the orientation of neighbouring
long-chain alkanes within the urea channels can be determined, along with
evidence for a size-effect in the urea framework; 

<LI>Disorder in yttria-doped cubic zirconia
(Zr<SUB>0.61</SUB>Y<SUB>0.39</SUB>O<SUB>1.805</SUB>), where effectively all
of the X-ray diffuse scattering is due to distortion of the cation
framework.  The similar scattering factors of Zr and Y means that second
order and higher terms are seen. The effect of oxygen vacancy ordering can
also be seen  in the X-ray measurements as this leads to relaxation of the
metal atoms from their equilibrium sites.  This vacancy ordering gives
structure to the diffuse scattering pattern;

<LI>Disorder in mullite
(Al<SUB>2</SUB>(Al<SUB>2+2x</SUB>Si<SUB>2-2x</SUB>)O<SUB>10-x</SUB>), where
again good models describing the diffuse scattering pattern can be built. 

</UL>
<P>
Recent work aims to move from the current need for some initial insight into
the problem before construction of plausible models, to a method adjusting
parameters automatically using a least squares procedure, which would, in
principle, allow for the interpretation of diffuse scattering <I>ab
initio</I>. However, in this method, the calculations of the necessary
differentials are not straightforward and the differentials have to be
evaluated numerically.

<P>
The first system tested with this procedure was
Fe<SUB>3</SUB>(CO)<SUB>12</SUB>, where the basic disorder is a 180&deg; flip
of the Fe<SUB>3</SUB> unit; that in the carbonyl groups can be ignored to
first order.  The parameters in the diffuse scattering interpretation
procedure included 8 occupancy (pair-wise) correlations, 4 centre-of-mass
relaxation size-effects and 4 orientational relaxation size-effects.  The
differentials for each can be evaluated numerically; the refinement
progressed towards a reasonable fit in around 8 cycles.  One important
aspect of this process was that initial attempts at interpreting the diffuse
scattering pattern based on just two sections through the diffraction
pattern showed that these were not sufficient; the inclusion of a third
section was required for consistency. Apart from that, considerable detail
can be reproduced by the modelling procedure, lending strength to the
argument that the method will soon allow a quantitative interpretation of
diffuse scattering.

<P>
Having constructed the model automatically, the configurations produced can
now be inspected.  For example, comparisons can be made with Bragg
scattering results by averaging the generated configurations.  Local
structural detail and correlations between molecules can also be examined.
Librational modes are not accessible by examining the Bragg scattering alone
but can be distinguished by diffuse scattering .  In this case of
Fe<SUB>3</SUB>(CO)<SUB>12</SUB> there is clear evidence of concerted motion.
The work is now being extended to more complex systems; the continuing huge
increases in computing power (a factor of 1000 increase every 10 years over
the last 30 years) are making these difficult problems tenable.

<P>
This clear, educational and informative Lonsdale lecture concluded with an
illuminating demonstration of optical transforms.  This illustrated how the
effects discussed above lead to characteristic patterns of diffuse
scattering, and delightfully illustrated how these are built up from simple
distortions from a regular structure.  Diffuse scattering remains
non-routine and challenging in its analysis but this lecture demonstrated
the enormous strides that are being made towards its interpretation.

<h2>Report on The J. Monteath Robertson Symposium</h2>

<HR>
<P>
<BR>
During IUCr XVIII an evening symposium celebrated the great personal
contribution to  X-ray crystallography of J. Monteath Robertson, F.R.S.,
Gardiner Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow from 1942 to
1970. 

<P>
The symposium was organised and chaired by one of JMR's ex-students, Jim
Trotter (Ph.D. 1957). An overview of Robertson's career was presented by
Robert Bryan (Ph.D. 1957), a pupil of another internationally distinguished
Glasgow crystallographer, Jim Speakman. Besides touching on some of the
highlights of Robertson's career - his solution of the phthalocyanine
structure by isomorphous replacement and the development and application of
the heavy atom method - Bryan gave a graphic account of JMR's lectures to
first year undergraduates - an old and honorable tradition for holders of
chairs at ancient Scottish universities.

<P>
Jack Dunitz (Ph.D. 1946), Sydney Abrahams (Ph.D. 1949), and Michael Rossmann
(Ph.D. 1956), all ex-students of JMR, described their memories of him during
the heroic days of the 1940s and 1950s when crystallographic apparatus was
primitive and a mechanical calculating machine represented leading-edge
technology. Their contributions painted a rounded portrait of JMR, both as a
research scientist and as a teacher. JMR's training as an organic chemist
allowed him to see more clearly than most that X-ray analysis could
revolutionise organic chemistry, rendering obsolete purely chemical methods
of structure determination. Today, he is hailed as founding father of both
chemical crystallography and crystal engineering. As a teacher JMR trained
over fifty graduate students, many of whom have gone on to make their own
distinguished contributions to the subject, both here and abroad. Dunitz, in
a moving conclusion to his talk, emphasized the importance of the Robertson
diaspora of young and enthusiastic crystallographers to the development of
chemical crystallography in many countries, notably the U.S.A., Canada,
Australia, and Switzerland. Today, Robertson's department has a large
crystallography group with active programs in protein structure analysis,
experimental charge density determination, organometallic and cluster
chemistry, direct methods and crystallographic programming. Neil Isaacs, who
leads the protein crystallography group, described current activities. 

<P>
The large audience included about 70 crystallographers with Glasgow
connections, including Durward Cruickshank who was persuaded by JMR to
accept a chair in Glasgow in the 1960s, and George Sim (Ph.D. 1955) who
succeeded JMR in the Gardiner Chair. It is pleasant to note that JMR's
daughter, Mrs Patricia Escott, her two sons, and Miss Ann Boyd, JMR's
secretary for many years, were also present.
