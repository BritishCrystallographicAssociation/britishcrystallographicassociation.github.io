<P>
The British Crystallographic Association has collaborated with the Natural
History Museum in the new edition of their book <B><EM>"Crystals",
</EM></B> which is
co-written by BCA member Gordon Cressey, and Ian Mercer. 

<P>
"Crystals" is a very informative and visually spectacular 60 page
full-colour softback book, describing and illustrating the external and
internal beauty of crystals of all kinds, from gemstones to proteins and
viruses, and their usage and importance in the world around us. It makes an
excellent present for friends and relatives, to answer all those difficult
questions they ask about what it is you do and why it is important !

<P>
"Crystals" was launched with great success and to considerable acclaim at
the Glasgow IUCr Congress, but if you didn't pick one up there, you can
obtain copies from the BCA Treasurer for the price of  <B>&pound;7.95</B> 
each inc. P&amp;P at the address shown below:
