<h2>Science, Facilities and Facilitating Science<br>
A Meeting to Mark The Retirement of Professor Alan Leadbetter</h2>
</center>
<P>
Until 1982 Alan Leadbetter was Professor of Physical Chemistry at the
University of Exeter where he established an international reputation for
his research in the thermodynamic properties of solids, the structures and
dynamics of glasses, order disorder transitions and molecular rotations in
crystals, and the structures and molecular dynamics of liquid crystals, in
all of which neutron scattering played a central role.  However, in that
year Alan decided that in addition to pursuing his own interests in science,
he could also facilitate the science of others by taking up the position of
Associate Director, Head of Science Department and Head of Neutron Division
at the Rutherford Laboratory. In this role Alan oversaw the completion,
commissioning and internationalisation of the world's most powerful pulsed
neutron source, ISIS. Following this outstanding success Alan was appointed,
in 1988, as Director of Daresbury Laboratory where he helped to establish
the SRS as a leading X-ray synchrotron research facility. He "retired" from
Daresbury Laboratory in 1994 and in the same year was awarded the CBE.
However, still far from retiring, Alan moved on to the prestigious position
as the British Directeur-Adjoint and Director of Science at the Institut
Laue Langevin in Grenoble from which he retired in August of this year.

<P>
Throughout his career in scientific research and at the major research
facilities Alan developed a tremendous rapport with the international
science community, earning the respect, friendship and gratitude of
condensed matter scientists across the globe. Over sixty of these friends,
colleagues and collaborators gathered at Cosener's House, Abingdon on 22 and
23 October for a remarkably enjoyable and stimulating scientific and social
event organised by the joint Neutron Scattering Group of the Institute of
Physics and the Faraday Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry. This
event, a conference aptly entitled Science, Facilities and Facilitating
Science, was arranged specifically to mark Alan's retirement and to
celebrate his career. As an additional bonus, the conference also provided a
lively and far reaching overview of the current international status of
research fields as diverse as physical chemistry, neutron scattering,
synchrotron studies, nuclear and particle physics and muon Spin Resonance..

Faced with the problem of what retirement present he should buy for the man
who has everything, Colin Carlile, the new British Director of ILL, chose a
garden gnome!<br>

As expected, the conference had a distinctly international flavour, with
delegates and speakers travelling from France, Germany, Holland, Japan,
Italy, Russia, the USA and of course from all over Britain. The first day of
the conference was dedicated purely to science with wide-ranging
presentations by <strong>Rob Richardson</strong>, Bristol <em>(The Structure and
Dynamics of Liquid Crystals)</em>, <strong>Neville Greaves</strong>, Aberystwyth
<em>(Zeolites and nanoparticles)</em>, <strong>Takasuke Matsuo</strong>, Osaka
<em>(Proton tunnelling and deuteration-induced phase transitions in
hydrogen-bonded crystals)</em>, <strong>John Goodby</strong>, Hull <em>(Liquid crystals
of unusual structure)</em>, <strong>Cesare Bucci</strong>, Parma <em>(Condensed matter
studies by spin polarised muons)</em> and <strong>Don Kearley</strong>, Delft <em>(A
quantum cure for frustration)</em>.  The science session ended with a short
but moving ceremony in which <strong>Alexandre Belushkin</strong>, representing the
Russian neutron scattering community, presented Alan with a samovar and a
unique medal in recognition of Alan's help and support for Russian neutron
scattering over the past twenty years. 

<P>
In the evening, the sixty delegates, together with a further thirty of
Alan's friends, colleagues, ex-research students and relatives, enjoyed a
wonderful informal sherry reception and banquet. Colin Carlile, Alan's
successor as the British Director of the ILL, provided a riotous after
dinner speech on behalf of the gathered scientists, whilst Alan's brother,
Michael Leadbetter, spoke movingly on behalf of Alan's friends and family. 

<P>
Despite the excesses of the previous evening's celebrations the Facilities
session got off to a prompt start the following morning.  <strong>Bob Cernik</strong>,
Daresbury Laboratory, opened the session with <em>Brilliance, drugs and
chocolate</em> and was followed by <strong>Hywel Price</strong>, RAL <em>(Sirius: the
alchemists' dream)</em>, <strong>Dirk Dubbers</strong>, Director of ILL <em>(On some
current problems of particle physics and cosmology)</em> and <strong>Andrew
Taylor</strong>, RAL, <em>(Expanding the frontiers....)</em>.  The session and the
conference was closed by <strong>Paul Williams</strong>, the Chairman of the OECD
Working Group on Neutron Sources, who posed the question <em>"Is there a
future for neutrons post Leadbetter?"</em>. The answer was a resounding
"YES", but that a significant part of that future is a direct consequence of
Alan's tireless and successful career in science, facilities and
facilitating science.
