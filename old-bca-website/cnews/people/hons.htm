<h1>Honorary members</h1> 
<p>
The concept of honorary membership for distingished crystallographers was 
first instituted in 1998, (see 
<a href="../1998/sep98/pages.html#hons">Page 2 of 'Crystallography News',</a>
 September 
1998 no. 66 ) and incorporated into the 
<a href="../../admin/stbyl.html#statb">BCA Statutes in 2000.</a>
<a href="honchr.htm">Click here</a> for a list of
all honorary members alphabetic by surname with date. <br><br>

A list of current honorary members is published in 
'Crsytallography News' from time to time
 available lists are:
<a href="../1999/dec99/hons99.html">1999</a>&nbsp;
