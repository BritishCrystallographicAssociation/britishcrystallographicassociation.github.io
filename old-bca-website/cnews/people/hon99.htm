<P>
The names of current (December 1999) Honorary members are listed below in
alphabetical order of surname, with brief summaries of their achievements,
where further information is available there is a link to it with the word
info. 
Please send further details to the Editor of 'Crystallography News' so that
we can compile a readily available biographical archive and bibliography on
the BCA Web site. </p>

  <li><strong><em>Arnold Beevers  </em></strong>
<a href="../../obits/names.html#ab">info</a><BR>
One of the two originators of the <em>Beevers-Lipson</em> strips, which
enabled Fourier calculations to be made as part of structure solutions in
the days before computers were available. Carried out many early structure
determinations. Latterly set up Beevers Miniature Model Unit, which now
exports molecular models  throughout the world, and provides useful work 
for the disabled in the Edinburgh area. <br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Bill Cochran</em></strong> <BR>
While at Cavendish Laboratory made many contributions to crystallography;
notably the theory of diffraction from helical structures (an idea used by
Crick and Watson in the DNA double helix model), phonon dispersion and the
soft mode theory of phase transitions. Author, with Henry Lipson,  of one of
the early 'standard' crystallography texts.<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Bob Evans</em></strong> <BR>
One of the founder members of the IUCr. He was their first General Secretary
and an early editor of <em>Acta Cryst</em>.<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Bruce Forsyth </em></strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#jbf">info</a><BR>
Well known for his fundamental work on neutron scattering from magnetic structures and for his role in organising the common method of instrument control and data collection used by all instruments at  the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's ISIS Facility. While the BCA Vice president he pioneered the idea of 'Oral Posters' for training in giving concise lectures at the BCA Annual meeting and ably hosted many of the early ones.<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Ron Jenkins</em> </strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#rj">info</a><BR>
One of the pioneers of the ICDD powder diffraction file.<br><br> 
 
  <li><strong><em>Aaron Klug </em></strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#ak">info</a><BR>
Current President of the Royal Society, Nobel Laureate in 1982 for his work on the development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his discovery of the structures of biologically important nucleic acid - protein complexes.<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Helen Megaw </em></strong>
<a href="../../obits/names.html#hdm">info</a><BR>
Distinguished scientist from the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge, where she
was a student of J D Bernal. Made the first structure determination of a
ferroelectric material, barium titanate. Early determination of ice
structure led to her having an island in the Antarctic named after her.
Major contributor on the structures of felspars.<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Max Perutz</em></strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#mp">info</a><BR>
Nobel Laureate in 1962 for his work on the structure of haemoglobin.
<br><br>
  <li><strong><em>John E. Walker </em></strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#jew">info</a><BR>
Nobel Laureate in Chemistry in 1997 for the elucidation of the enzymatic
mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme<br><br>

  <li><strong><em>Terry Willis</em></strong> 
<a href="../../obits/names.html#btmw">info</a> <BR>
Made Important contributions in neutron scattering, particularly thermal
motion and in uranium compounds. Organiser of many 'Harwell Summer Schools'
in Neutron scattering.<br><br>
