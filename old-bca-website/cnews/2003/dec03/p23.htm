<P>
In this publication Pecharsky and Zavalij aim to produce a text that will
provide both undergraduate and graduate students with a thorough grounding
in the practical aspects of powder diffraction, methods for structure
solution from powder data, and in the technique of Rietveld refinement.

 As
such the book aims to cover material that might traditionally have been
found in classics such as the texts by Klug and Alexander or Cullity, as
well as introducing areas covered in more depth by specialist publications
such as the IUCr monographs edited by Young and
David/Shankland/McCusker/Baerlocher.
  The stated entry level is that of
students with a "general scientific and mathematical background of the order
of the first two years of a typical...college". <br><br>
The book is a well produced
and well illustrated text and includes a CD featuring colour figures, the
numerous data sets presented in the text and solutions to the end of chapter
problems.  The cover deserves special note being apparently inspired by
Dali's depiction of Narcissus falling in love with his own reflection and
metamorphing via an egg into a flower - represented here by an intermetallic
compound seeing a diffraction pattern, transforming to a reciprocal lattice
before becoming an inorganic mixed metal oxide!</td>

Chapter 1, as is common with many texts, covers elementary aspects of
symmetry in the solid state, though also includes a nice "taster" of more
exotic aspects of symmetry such as incommensurate modulation and
quasicrystals to whet the reader's appetite.</p>

<P>
Chapter 2 (160 pages) is an ambitious attempt to cover the "Fundamentals of
Diffraction" from the production and monochromatisation of x-rays, their
detection, simple diffraction theory through to the intensity corrections
required for analysing powder data.  I must confess that this was by far my
least favourite chapter of the book as I personally found the arrangement of
material peculiar.  For example, monochromators are described before the
phenomenon of diffraction has been introduced.  The geometry of diffraction
is then described (pleasingly to me via use of the Ewald sphere), however
there are then some 60 pages covering intensity corrections and powder peak
shapes before structure factors are introduced.  Whilst there is nothing
inherently wrong with the material, I can't help feeling that the approach
could be confusing to beginners.  I also felt that the level at which
diffraction is introduced might be slightly daunting to the stated target
audience.</p>

<P>
Chapter 3 covers "Experimental Techniques" starting with a historical
description of powder diffraction methods and instrumentation before moving
on to consider sample mounting and how to optimise hardware and data
collection parameters.  There is also a useful section on the safety aspects
of using ionising radiation.  Common errors such as an inappropriate choice
of slit size for a given experiment are covered in depth.  I did feel that
there was rather too much overlap between some of this material and that
covered in chapter 2, particularly regarding e.g. monochromators and the
choice of slits/detector set ups for different experiments.</p>

<P>
Chapter 4 describes the "Preliminary Data Processing and Phase Analysis" of
materials and essentially deals with the "everyday" aspects of routine
powder diffraction work including peak searching, peak profile fitting and
phase identification - in essence the analysis a diffractionist might
perform "at the instrument".  The material is covered in an exhaustive
fashion with detailed descriptions of the various stages of the process. 
Practical examples of the pros and cons of different background fitting,
smoothing, &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB> stripping and peak search algorithms are 
described which will be of use to inexperienced operators.</p>

<P>
In chapters 5, 6 and 7 this text perhaps comes into its own in that it
switches to an example-based format to cover the topics of indexing,
structure solution and structure refinement.  A large number of real
examples, drawn from the authors' own research, and backed up with a CD of
data and input files for readers to play with, are provided. The approach
adopted falls somewhere between that of a classical text book and a lab
manual/interactive course.  Chapter 5 deals with the problems of indexing
and refining unit cells. Although indexing is now largely automated the
authors describe some traditional methods of manual indexing to set the
scene.  The use of the "classic" software packages ITO, VISSER and DICVOL is
then described in depth with several practical examples.  Methods for
refining cells are then described, along with an outline of the least
squares method.  This particular section feels slightly out of place in this
chapter as it's a technique that permeates much of the book, and could
perhaps have been dealt with separately elsewhere, particularly as a similar
treatment of non-linear least squares pops up in the middle of chapter 6. 
This is perhaps a chapter which will date rapidly as there has been a
significant resurgence of interest in the science of indexing recently, and
many new techniques/software packages are appearing to supplement the
classic methods.  This is, of course, no fault of the authors! </p> 

<P>
The final two chapters concentrate on methods of solving (chapter 6) and
refining (chapter 7) structures.  After brief introductory sections both
chapters present examples from the authors' own labs.  In addition to
examples solved by Patterson and direct methods it's nice to see cases
quoted where "crystallographic common sense" and a thorough knowledge of the
literature have proved as important as using "black-box" software packages. 
The authors have chosen an approach in which the crystal structure of each
example is solved in chapter 6 and then details of its refinement given in
chapter 7.  Whilst this works extremely well from the viewpoint of
completeness it does lead to a slightly illogical order in chapter 7 where
later examples are often less complex then earlier, and introduce no
particularly significant new features.  My only criticism of these two
chapters is that it would have been valuable, considering the huge current
interest in the area, to include a worked example in the text of the use of
real space methods to solve an organic structure and illustrate the specific
pitfalls that can be encountered during refinement of molecular species.  It
might also have been nice to illustrate (perhaps in comparison to the
methods already described) the use of an alternate programme, such as the
widely used EXPO.</p>

<P>
Overall this is a useful, generally accurate and relatively comprehensive
text that provides a good coverage of this area of crystallography.  It is
perhaps slightly long to be suitable as an introductory text for students
and contains some annoying repetitions when read sequentially, but will
provide a valuable reference source for any lab involved in powder work. 
There are areas I feel could have been usefully included, though these are
clearly my personal bias.  They would include non-ambient diffraction; more
on topics such as the problems involved in combined neutron/x-ray
refinements - how, for example, were data sets weighted in the combined
refinement in chapter 7?; and more examples based on synchrotron/neutron
data sets.</p>

<P>
It's a relatively expensive text (&pound;98 from Amazon though in the US
Kluwer offer significant discounts if several copies are purchased as a
course book) to expect students to buy, though this is perhaps justified for
a 700+ page hard-backed book with extensive additional material on compact
disk.  My only caveat to potential purchasers is to think before they fly -
this was the first book ever to put my travel plans in jeopardy when it
tipped my Easy Jet carry-on luggage over the weight limit! Rest assured
though, that the simple act of removing the book from the bag in one's right
hand and carrying it through the departure lounge in one's left is
sufficient to satisfy check in requirements!</p>
