<h2> Elections to Council in 2003</h2>

<P>
<B>Statement by Professor  C C Wilson</B>

<P>
It is an honour to be nominated for election as BCA President.  As a
longstanding active member of the BCA I believe that I have its interests at
heart and would put my energy and enthusiasm into helping the organisation
move on from its present strong position.  There has been an increasing
professionalism to the BCA, introduced during the tenures of recent
presidents, which is essential to our continued good health as a major
scientific association in the 2000s.  The consolidation of our previously
part-time organisation into the hands of the professionals at Northern
Networking has been a positive experience, and it is our responsibility to
work with our professional organisers to continue to develop the BCA in an
appropriate manner for a 1000-member organisation.

<P>
In spite of our healthy position, both in terms of our international
standing and influence and our finances (stemming largely from the success
of the Glasgow IUCr meeting), I see there are still issues we must address. 
There is still a sense of fragmentation within the BCA that is unhealthy,
and our flagship event, the Spring meeting, is still not attracting the
level of attendance I feel it deserves.

<P>
As a means of mitigating against fragmentation, particularly within the
Spring meeting, I believe that the formation of further cross-subject group
Special Interest Groups is important for the future of the BCA, and will
work for their introduction if elected as President.  The cross-disciplinary
nature of much of Crystallography makes this step appealing.  Examples of
possible SIG areas might include: Supramolecular chemistry (CCG/BSG):
Structural solid state chemistry (PCG/CCG); Drug design and interactions
(BSG/CCG/IG); High resolution diffraction (PCG/IG); Structure solution from
powders (PCG/IG/CCG); Crystallisation and polymorphism (BSG/CCG/IG).  There
will be many more ideas, and SIGs that embrace partnerships with related
organisations (e.g. CCP4, IoP &amp; RSC groups, BACG) can also be
encouraged.  The combination of these cross-group SIGs in stimulating the
Spring meeting, with the successful role of the existing subject groups in
organising more specialist meetings, workshops and teaching events,
represents to me a healthy way forward.

<P>
Related to the above, I believe the impact of (and attendance at) our Spring
meetings can be substantially enhanced.  Over the past couple of years there
has been a major discussion over the future directions of the BCA Spring
meeting, centred around cost and duration on the one hand and scientific
programme on the other.  In the former, we will be exploring at York a new
structure for the meeting, while on the latter there has been an attempt to
give increasing emphasis on joint sessions between the subject groups. 
However, I still feel that there should be significantly increased
competition for scientific slots at the Spring meeting.  The formation of
SIGs would give added impetus to this and offer to the Programme Committee a
wider choice of proposed sessions with which to seek an exciting and
balanced programme.  With the Spring meeting being the key forum for the BCA
as a whole, it is vital we get both the science and practicalities right,
and make our meeting attractive to BCA members and also to our colleagues in
associated fields.  The introduction of the publication of the BCA Review
Symposium is another step towards increasing the impact of the meeting. 
With our membership base there is no reason why the Spring meeting should
not regularly attract attendances of 400+ to a vibrant and scientifically
competitive programme.

<P>
The BCA can have a significant role in canvassing and representing the needs
of the UK crystallography community in the development and exploitation of
the Diamond synchrotron.  The new source will be of high relevance to all
interest groups within the BCA, and for this reason we have inaugurated the
Diamond SIG.  The work of this SIG should develop as the plans for the
source develop and act as a focus for informing, lobbying and representing
the community.

<P>
My own background is as a crystallographer and chemical physicist using
X-ray and neutron diffraction, largely single crystal but also powder
diffraction, in the study of organic and related structures.  I currently
head the Crystallography Group at the ISIS neutron sources at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory, where I also head the Centre for Molecular Structure
&amp; Dynamics, and am Visiting Professor in Chemistry at the University of
Durham.  My role at the central facility gives me the opportunity to see a
wide range of Structural Science, and to track the trends in a range of
areas - my recent appointment as Co-editor of Acta Cryst B will consolidate
this.  Within the BCA, of which I have been a member since 1986, I have been
a member of the Committees of both the CCG and PCG (the latter as
Secretary/Treasurer), and have been a member of Council since 1997.  I am
currently UK Councillor to the European Crystallographic Association. 
Since1998 I have organised the Abstract submission and Conference book for
BCA meetings, and in 1999 led the Abstracts Team for the Glasgow IUCr
Congress.  More recently, I have been involved in the restructuring of the
Spring meeting and am Guest Editor of the inaugural BCA Review Symposium
issue of Crystallography Reviews.

<P>
If elected I shall work hard to advance the best interests of the BCA and
all its constituent parts.
