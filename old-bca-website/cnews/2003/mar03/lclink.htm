                   been awarded because somebody else got there first, or where
                   the idea was too obvious to deserve protection. It has happened
                   often, most embarrassingly in 1993 when a company called
                   Comptons New Media was given, in effect, a patent on multimedia.
                   Not only was the patent absurdly broad, but much of the work had
                   been done by Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre two decades
                   earlier.

<P>
   <UL>
   <LI>All a patent does is give you the right to sue someone in
a civil action. At some future date in a ridiculously costly,
extremely drawn out and easily circumvented legal process.
Nobody has ever "won" any patent litigation. The main
purpose of patent fights are to cause more grief and harm
to the opposition than you are causing yourself. Almost
always, this purpose fails miserably.
<P>
  <LI>Fact:Prior art is not needed to bust any patent.
<BR>
All you really have to do is show that the claims would
have been reasonably obvious to any "practitioner in the
field." That’s all it takes.
<P>
As is often the case, a patent search gets made without
actually looking at any of the non-patent history of the
field in the way of key papers, seminars and trade journals.
All you have to do is find someone somewhere that says it
sure would have been obvious to them.
<P>
When (not if) your patent ends up busted, you will also
run the risk of a frivolous litigation countersuit. Thus, if you
have the temerity to try and defend your patent, you could
end up being fined thousands of dollars.
<P>
  <LI>Some Better Alternatives:
<BR>
So, if you are a Midnight Engineer, just what are the
alternative methods for successfully marketing your ideas
and concepts? Based on many years of personal experience
and several cubic yards of overflowing third-party patent
victim files, here’s what I’d suggest . . 
<P>
First, totally avoid any and all contact with anything
even remotely patent related. In any way, shape or form.
<P>
Do so religiously.
<P>
Second, don’t even bother creating anything in any field
in which you are not eventually certain to become an
expert. An expert that is thoroughly familiar with the
technical literature, the history of the field, the marketing
realities, the insider trade journals, and the mainstream
tools and techniques in use. There is no point whatsoever
in writing forest fire simulation software if you have never
sharpened a Pulaski. Nor (as sadly happened to yet another
victim just this morning) in patenting a "new scheme to
replace inductors" without having read and understood
Sallen and Key in their 1955 classic paper.
<P>
Third, publish all your key secrets and ideas in a major
magazine, leaving out no detail, and omitting no insider
secrets. This immediately can generate positive cash flow
for you and safely tucks all your ideas away in the public
domain, preventing most others from attempting to patent
them. This also will expose your new ideas to the widest
possible audience.
<P>
Fourth, try to set up some royalty arrangement with a
smaller to medium firm in some position to market and
distribute your invention. The normal royalty payment is
typically in the five percent range. Now for the tricky part:
They must come to you, and never vice versa. That is why
it is super important to publish your ideas and creations
and expose them as widely as possible.
<P>
You normally have one and only one defense against
getting ripped off in any royalty setup: The expectation
that you will be delivering newer and better stuff in the
future. And that is all.
<P>
Fifth, employ the shotgun technique. There is no way
that one single idea or product will hack it. To survive in
this game, you’ll need hundreds or even thousands of new
ideas and concepts working for you on a total lifetime and
total lifestyle basis. Chances are that one or two genuine
winners will pay for all the others lost or stolen.
<P>
Finally, be realistic. You don’t create things to get filthy
rich. You create things because you like to create things
and have some compelling desire or need to do so. As long
as there are enough nickels to keep going, that is all that
should really matter.

    <LI>"It's well known that the US Patent and Trademark Office has had problems in the area of software," said University of California, Berkeley law professor Pamela Samuelson, a 1997 recipient of the MacArthur Foundation award. The Patent Office's main problem is that it doesn't have an extensive repository of information on developments in software as it does, for example, in biochemistry, or shovels, Samuelson said. 
<P>
That's because in the first 30 years of the software industry, patents weren't issued on software, Samuelson said; the courts didn't think mathematical equations and algorithms were patentable. By the late 1980s, that view had been abandoned. But the late start resulted in thin records of software developments at the Patent Office, which means patent examiners have a difficult time establishing the legitimacy of claims. 
<P>
A patent applicant must prove that there is no relevant "prior art" in the same area, meaning there should be no similar inventions that predate the discovery in question. That's difficult to determine without extensive archives.

    <LI>"Although current law permits the filing of such protests and petitions, see 37 C.F.R. 1.291 and 1.292, these provisions were almost never used, in part because U.S. patent applications traditionally were not published and therefore it was difficult or impossible for a third party to know what was pending before the PTO. By providing for both automatic publication and the submission of prior art, the Act intends to permit third parties to mount an effective challenge to business method patents before they even leave the PTO.
<P>
Opposition Proceedings
<P>
Many foreign patent systems provide for an administrative proceeding called an opposition in which any member of the public can challenge a newly-issued patent on the grounds that it fails to meet one or more of the requirements for patentability. The proposed legislation would introduce procedures of this type into U.S. patent law for the first time. Specifically, under the Act the Director of the PTO would establish an Administrative Opposition Panel, to be comprised of not less than 18 administrative opposition judges of "competent legal knowledge and scientific ability". Any third party would be permitted to file a request for an opposition to a business method patent under 35 U.S.C. @ 101, @ 102, @ 103 or @ 112 within nine months of the issuance of the patent. Moreover, once opposition proceedings are commenced, the proposed legislation would allow any party to obtain a stay of any pending court proceeding, other than a Federal Circuit appeal, that involves the patentability of any claim at issue in the opposition.
<P>
The Act would allow the patent owner to respond to a request for opposition by filing a statement addressing the grounds for the request, including any amendment to the patent or new claims. The requesting party would be permitted to file a reply and then the opposition would be assigned to an administrative opposition judge, who could consider evidence both in the form of oral testimony (including direct and cross examination of experts), or in any deposition, affidavit or other documentary form. The judge would be required to rule on the patentability of the business method no later than 18 months after the date upon which the third party filed its request for an opposition. The judge's ruling could then be appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under 35 U.S.C. @ 134 and reviewed by the Federal Circuit and district courts,
respectively, under 35 U.S.C. @@ 141 and 145.
<P>
Amendments to a business method patent could be made at any time during an opposition. Upon the expiration of the period for appeals or the termination of an appeal, the Director would publish a certificate, inter alia, incorporating any amendment determined to be patentable. However, as in the case of amendments made in reexamination or reissue proceedings under current law, the Act would provide a defense of intervening rights to any person who practiced the invention covered by any such amended claim, or who made substantial preparations to do so, prior to the issuance of a certificate incorporating the amendment, unless such activities infringe a claim of the amended patent that
was present in the unamended patent."

technologists to lawyers - from people making real products to people applying for regulatory privilege and protection. An increasingly significant cost of Net startups involves both defensive and offensive lawyering - making sure you don't "steal" someone else's "idea" and quickly claiming as yours every "idea" you can describe in a patent application. 3"

four other companies by refusing to license one of its patents.
Recently, as the result of work by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Human Genome Sciences (HGS) learned that a receptor it had
previously patented was actually an important pathway for HIV to enter
cells. The result: HGS can now stop competitors' aids research. The U.S.
Patent Office has recently made this sort of serendipitous patent use
harder, but it can't take away patents already granted. "

<P>
    <LI>"Why is PANIP suing all these companies?
<BR>
We wonder this as well....
<P>
Why was PanIP (Pangea Intellectual Properties L.L.C) formed in March
of 2002, less than a month before filing their first lawsuit against us?
<P>
Why has PanIP chosen to go after small, hometown businesses with
moderate gross earnings to begin their patent protection crusade?
<P>
Why, when there are so many corporations out there currently running
websites that annually gross millions in profits, while at the same time
supposedly infringing upon the exact same patents, is PanIP going after
the smaller businesses?
<P>
Why did PanIP hire a consulting firm, Chi Consulting Firm in New
Jersey, to identify suitable defendants for this case, when there are so
many larger, blatantly obvious choices?
<P>
Why did PanIP use Dun & Bradstreet credit information to select who
they were going to sue?
<P>
We can only ponder the reasons, but one might conclude that the
opposition assumes a legal battle waged against a number of smaller
businesses, all located in other areas of the US and far away from the
venue of the Federal Court District in Southern California, and all with
somewhat limited financial resources and legal experience, would be a
simple victory to achieve, and easy money in their pocket. Perhaps they
feel that a legal victory would set a precedent, from which they could
then leap to attack wealthier corporations."

<P>
    <LI>"The Role of Patents
<P>
6.  Patents are a long-established means of encouraging innovation. A patent confers on its holder a legal monopoly, for a limited period, in commercial exploitation of the patented invention. In return for the monopoly the inventor must disclose his invention so that others may utilise his knowledge."
<P>
    <LI>"Innovation is a feature of competition in business methods (whether computer- implemented or not), as companies strive for competitive advantage.... Patents--ie monopolies--could reduce innovation and consumer choice.... The Government's conclusion is that those who favour some form of patentability for business methods have not provided the necessary evidence that it would be likely to increase innovation. Unless and until that evidence is available, ways of doing business should remain unpatentable." 
    <LI>Full Quote: "23.  Most respondents did not feel that new technologies, above all the internet, have changed this argument. A minority of the organisations disagreed. They felt that, as new technology has created new possibilities, some of which may involve considerable R&D cost to realise, then patents should be available for computer-implemented business methods. But most thought that innovation is a feature of competition in business methods (whether computer-implemented or not), as companies strive for competitive advantage. They argued that copying of business methods can spur new ones intended to (re)gain advantage. Patents – ie monopolies – could reduce innovation and consumer choice."

There's been a lot of press about my activities regarding software patents 
and the summit meeting that I've called on <i>Free Software and The Law.</i>
Since the press tends to simplify things and sometimes misinterprets  them,
it's time for me to talk about the situation of Software Patents and  Free
Software in my own words.<br>
<br>
The original <i>letters patent</i> were the orders of a king. These early 
legal documents were often used to grant special privileges to the kings friends.
Many letters patent granted a monopoly in a particular business to one family,
forever. Anyone else who went into the same business would have been defying
the orders of the king, so off with their heads!
<p>
The U.S. is important to this discussion because it's the cradle of software
and business-method patents. Most other nations don't allow such things
to be patented, although certain companies are lobbying to change that. U.S. 
law, being a descendent of English Common Law, has preserved the patent,
though in a more limited sense than its royal application. The Constitution
of the United States states:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Congress Shall Have Power To </i>[...]<i> promote the Progress 
of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors
the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the entire justification for the existence of the U.S. copyright
and patent system. Both exist to <i>promote</i> the <b>progress</b> of science 
and the <i>useful arts</i>: technology, literature, and  so on. If the patent 
and copyright system do <i>not</i> have the effect  of promoting progress, 
they aren't constitutional. Note that the constitution also says <i>limited 
times.</i> Patents and copyrights are <i>meant to expire</i> - if they don't, 
they aren't constitutional.
<p>
So, we might consider whether or not software patents <i>are</i> actually 
promoting progress, or if they might even be hindering it. Surprisingly, there
is <i>no</i> hard evidence that software and business method patents promote
progress. There don't seem to be any good scientific studies on the issue.
<p>
The U.S. patent system rewards an inventor with a temporary monopoly on
their invention, in exchange for full public disclosure of the invention.
This is supposed to be an incentive for inventors to disclose their work
instead of keeping it secret. The Free Software paradigm seems to be a better
means than a patent to get people to disclose their ideas.
The large body of free software developed in just the past few years shows
us that Free Software has influenced many people to publish,
and of course Free Software avoids the monopoly inherent in a patent.
Perhaps that alone is sufficient reason for a critical re-examination of
the idea of software patents.
<p>
When a patent expires, after 20 years, the invention goes into the public
domain, which means that it's everyone's property. Thus, you can use the
principle of an expired patent for free, you won't have to pay the inventor
a royalty. You are only allowed to patent something that you really did invent,
that hasn't been publicly used or disclosed before. In the U.S., you get
a year to file your application after you create an invention. There are
big penalties for lying on your application, for example, for falsifying
the date of an invention.
<p>
Large companies like HP most often use patents <i>defensively. </i>Since 
they know that other companies will apply for patents and then sue for patent 
infringement, a company that wants to defend itself files its own patents 
to use against its competitors. This creates a <i>d&eacute;tente</i> between
the company and its competitors - each could sue the other in a similar
way, so neither one does. The competing companies generally enter a <i>cross-licensing 
agreement, </i> licensing all of each others patents. Each company thus negates
the other company's power to sue over its patents. Large companies are generally
cross-licensed with many other large companies, including their own competitors,
and thus their power to sue each other over patent infringement is mostly
nullified.
<p>
So, since the big companies patents all are used to nullify each other, the
patents really have zero value to the companies. Why, then, do they bother
with patents at all? I think the primary reason is a typical feature of
<i> d&eacute;tente</i>: if you stop behaving offensively before the other 
guys  do, you lose. If one large company stopped filing new patents,  the 
other companies would no longer have a reason to cross-license with that company,
and then the other companies would start filing patent-infringement lawsuits.
<p>
There are a few other reasons that large companies continue to file patents:
some of them want to use them to fight a competitor who isn't cross-licensed,
for example a Free Software developer who writes a competing program. Some
of them use patents to give investors an impression that the company has
value. However, the vast majority of software patents, some say as high as
95% of them, are actually invalid due to the existence of <i>prior art. </i>
Prior art means that someone else has invented the same thing before, and
has published or disclosed the invention in some way, thus invalidating all
future patents on that invention. Because software patents are so often invalid,
the investor is being deceived. When I've taken this up with companies who
are looking for investment and list their patents as major assets, I usually
get an answer like <i>yes, we know that is a problem for software patents
in general, but <b>ours</b> are enforcible.</i> Yeah, right.
<p>
So, who profits from all of this if the large companies don't? Not the 
small and individual inventors, they can't afford to sue to collect on their
own patents. The system does keep a lot of patent lawyers in business, costing
companies Billions every year. It may also keep some research scientists
in business, since companies sponsor research departments so that they can
have a steady flow of inventions upon which to file patents.
<p>
Of course, getting companies to sponsor research is a good thing, and you
might even think it justifies the patent system. However, wouldn't it be
better if the research was targeted to benefit the company and its customers
rather than to provide ammunition for an eternal stalemate of a patent war?
And wouldn't it be better if the inventions of publicly-funded research organizations
like universities were in the public domain, since the public has paid 
for them? Instead, they are tied up with patents and sold. Some universities
claim that they need to be able to sell that patent monopoly, or they won't
be able to entice anyone to develop their ideas commercially. Although this
is a dubious claim, a U.S. law actually <i>mandates</i> patenting as part
of the "technology transfer" of publicly-funded research.
<p>
A trend over the past decade has been a new kind of <i>patent parasite</i>
company that exists only to sue other companies. The parasite buys up patents 
and then files infringement lawsuits against other companies with deep pockets 
and a lot to lose. The parasite offers licensing terms of a few tens or hundreds
of thousands of dollars, versus a cost of Millions for the victim to successfully
defend themselves in a lawsuit. The victim generally caves in and pays the
license fee, even though they could eventually have proven the patent to
be invalid in court. So, this is another tremendous drain of company funds
caused by the patent system. Parasites don't enter cross-licensing agreements,
so they represent one of the worst offensive uses of patents.
<p>
The cross-licensing defense works well if you have a lot of patents to use 
as ammunition, as a large company might, but the Free Software community has
only a handful of patents held by a few individual developers, and thus ends
up being an innocent bystander injured by a war of giants. Since it costs
tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to successfully file
an enforcible patent, we don't expect to get many more of them. So, scratch
the cross-licensing defense for now.
<p>
Since most software and business method patents are actually invalid, why 
don't we just prove that in court? It often takes Millions of dollars and 
years of time to win a single patent case. I don't know many Free Software 
developers who could afford to fight even one patent, and we are faced with 
hundreds of thousands of them.
<p>
Then, why don't we just "fix" the patent system? Well, the best way of fixing 
it might simply be to dispose of software and business method patents entirely, 
but most of the proposals to "fix" the patent system simply try to make the
problem only a little bit better. For example, there are plans to provide 
patent examiners with more prior art so that they will reject more of the 
invalid patents, but not nearly enough to solve the problem. Such proposals 
can only be treated as interim strategies, poor defenses to tide us over until
we can really solve the problem.
<p>
Arguments for killing software and business-method patents abound. I'll
list a few:
<ul>
<li>If the existence of software and business system patents doesn't
actually help to advance science and the useful arts, then they are constitutionally 
unjustified.</li>
<li>Software patents are all on applications of an extremely versatile
hardware device called a "computer". But then isn't the computer, not its
software, the thing that should have been patented?</li>
<li> The 20-year term of software patents is generally much longer
than the useful lifetime of the invention. This circumvents the constitutional
requirement that patents have a limited term, because the invention is so
obsolete as to be without any remaining value at all by the time it reaches
the public domain.</li>
<li>The monopoly that business-method patents create on a particular
form of business can constitute a violation of the anti-trust laws.</li>
<li>If other countries start accepting software and business method patents,
they will in effect be creating a <i> U.S.A. Tax</i> paid by their own citizens.
Those countries would just take all of the patent royalties paid by their
own companies and send them to the U.S.A., where the software and business-method
patent owners predominantly are today.</li>
</ul>
But the best argument for <i>this</i> essay is that software patents
block  Free Software development. Today, they are a nuisance, tomorrow they
could  be much more. There are companies that see Free Software, especially
GNU/Linux,  as an interloper to be shut down, a competitor to be eliminated.
Some of these companies have increased the rate at which they file new patents.
It's not impossible that these companies and their business partners could
start going after Free Software developers, <i>en masse, </i>with patent
infringement  lawsuits. Since essentially none of us can afford to defend
ourselves, most  developers would be forced to cave in, withdraw their software,
and stop participating in Free Software development. We must be ready with
a defense, before that day comes.
<p>
Ironically, some of the biggest patent holders are the Free Software Community's
own partners, companies like IBM and HP that have aggressively incorporated
GNU/Linux into their business plans and expect significant revenue from
it before long. IBM is said to hold 10% of software patents, and HP is one
of the largest patent holders in general. It's important for us to start
a dialogue  with these and other partners. That's why I am calling a summit
meeting on    <i>Free Software and The Law. </i>Patents will be a full-day
topic, with  DMCA, UCITA, license law, and other legal issues covered on
a subsequent day. Unfortunately, this isn't a public meeting. When asked
about that, Richard  Stallman said <i>inviting a public audience to a negotiation
isn't the best  way to get an agreement.</i> However, I've invited a broad
slate of Free Software representatives, covering all of our various viewpoints,
and will invite a few more.
<p>
The meeting will simply be a discussion and a negotiation, none of it is 
set in stone, but there are some things that the Free Software community
representatives might be likely to ask for. For example, we might ask for
some assurance that our corporate partners aren't going to sue us. When
Eric  Raymond and I asked this of an IBM representative recently, the answer
was  <i>we're not prosecuting our patents against Open Source developers.
</i> HP hasn't sued any of us either, although they haven't stated their
policy  in so many words. But perhaps the Free Software developers, enthusiastic
partners of IBM, HP, and other companies, deserve a little more formal assurance
of that policy and its continuation.
<p>
Another issue we might discuss is how to defend a Free Software developer
when he or she is sued for patent infringement. It might be fair to ask
our partners, who have much deeper pockets than ours, to help vest a fund
for our defense with an organization like FSF or EFF. Or perhaps we should
deal with each lawsuit as it comes up? With the DeCSS lawsuits, we found
that EFF can defend less than one case per year. We'll need more than that.
<p>
Since our software has proven so useful and effective in our partner companies,
I think the Free Software community would be negotiating from a position
of strength. We've proven our worth to our partners, and now we deserve to
understand how far they'll go for us. Hopefully, that will come out in the
summit discussion.
<p>
So, you can see that we have a lot to talk about, both at the summit and
in the Free Software community in general. The summit is being held on August
31 and September 1, in San Francisco, immediately after the LinuxWorld conference
there. Thus, many of the key players will be in town. HP has generously
promised enough funds to provide the meeting facilities and catering, and
to cover travel and lodging of some free software representatives who can
not pay their own way. HP says they are open to having equal co-sponsors,
so that the conference won't appear to be predominantly HP's. SSC has promised
to cover travel and lodging expenses for Richard Stallman, and other co-sponsors
will probably step up before the meeting.
<p>
I hope I've cleared up some mis-perception of what I've been working on,
and if this essay has been educational for you, I consider that an achievement
in itself. Of course, I'm open to your ideas. If you have comments or

   <LI>One of the best defenses we have today is the fully
disclosed nature of free software. If a patentable idea is
used in free software first, and that software is
distributed, we can use that software as evidence of
"prior art" in overturning a patent. However, this is only a
partial defense. The filer of a patent can claim that the
invention was created up to a year previous to filing. 
<P>
For example, AT&T informed me that it was filing a
patent on the key principle in my "Electric Fence"
malloc() debugging package almost a year after I first
posted the source code to a Usenet newsgroup. The
company claimed it had invented the principle before
my posting. Although AT&T hasn't bothered me so far,
there is a possibility that I will be hit with an expensive
patent-infringement lawsuit sometime in the next 12
years or so. There's a good chance I'd win the suit, but
I'd go broke in the process.

<P>
<LI>Origins
<P>
The origins of patents for invention are obscure and no one country can
claim to have been the first in the field with a patent system. However,
Britain does have the longest continuous patent tradition in the world.
Its origins can be traced back to the 15th century, when the Crown
started making specific grants of privilege to manufacturers and
traders.
<P>
Such grants were signified by Letters Patent, open letters marked with
the King's Great Seal. The earliest known English patent for invention
was granted by Henry VI to Flemish-born John of Utynam in 1449. The
patent gave John a 20-year monopoly for a method of making stained
glass, required for the windows of Eton College, that had not been
previously known in England.

       http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/history/fivehundred/tudors.htm</A>
<P>
<LI>Tudors and Stuarts
<P>
In the time of the Tudors it became common practice for the Crown to
grant monopolies for trades and manufacturers, including patents for
invention. During the 30 years from 1561 to 1590, Elizabeth I granted
about 50 patents whereby the recipients were enabled to exercise
monopolies in the manufacture and sale of commodities such as soap,
saltpetre, alum, leather, salt, glass, knives, sailcloth, sulphur,
starch, iron and paper. However, the Queen did refuse to grant patents
in certain cases. For example, in 1596 Sir John Harrington's request for
a patent on his design for a water closet was turned down on the grounds
of propriety.
<P>
Under both Elizabeth I and her successor James I, the granting of
monopolies for particular commodities became increasingly subject to
abuse. It was not uncommon for grants to be made for inventions and
trades that were not new; for example, a patent granted by Elizabeth I
for the making of knives with bone shafts was held by the Court of
Queen's Bench to be unsustainable because these articles were already
being made in the Realm. In some instances grants were made to royal
favourites or for the purpose of replenishing royal coffers.
<P>
In 1610, James I was forced by mounting judicial criticism and public
outcry to revoke all previous patents and declare in his "Book of
Bounty" that 'monopolies are things contrary to our laws' and "we
expressly command that no suitor presume to move us". He stated an
exception to this ban for "projects of new invention so they be not
contrary to the law, nor mischievous to the State". The doctrine of the
public interest was thus introduced into the patent system at a very
early date and the words were incorporated into the Statute of
Monopolies of 1624. Section 6 of the Statute rendered illegal all
monopolies except those "for the term of 14 years or under hereafter to
be made of the sole working or making of any manner of new manufactures
within this Realm to the true and first inventor"; such monopolies
should not be "contrary to the law nor mischievous to the State by
raising prices of commodities at home or hurt of trade".

<P>
<LI>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
<P>
In the 200 years after the Statute of Monopolies, the patent system
developed through the work of lawyers and judges in the courts without
government regulation. In the reign of Queen Anne, the law officers of
the Crown established as a condition of grant that "the patentee must by
an instrument in writing describe and ascertain the nature of the
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed". James Puckle's
1718 patent for a machine gun was one of the first to be required to
provide a "specification", as this instrument became known. The famous
patent of Arkwright for spinning machines was voided for the lack of an
adequate specification in 1785, after it had been in existence for 10
years. On the other hand, extensive litigation on Watt's 1796 patent for
steam engines established the important principles that valid patents
could be granted for improvements in a known machine, and for ideas or
principles, even though the specification might be limited to bare
statements of such improvements or principles, provided they could be
readily carried into effect, or were "clothed in practical application".
<P>
Britain's patent system served the country well during the dramatic
technological changes of the industrial revolution. However, by the
mid-19th century it had become extremely inefficient. The Great
Exhibition of 1851 accelerated demands for patent reform.
<P>
Up to that time, any prospective patentee had to present a petition to
no less than seven offices, and at each stage to pay certain fees. The
procedure was described in exaggerated form, somewhat derisively, by
Charles Dickens in his spoof, "A Poor Man's Tale of a Patent", published
in the 19th-century popular journal "Household Words"; Dickens' inventor
visits 34 offices (including some abolished years before). To meet
public concerns over this state of affairs, the Patent Office was
established by the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852, which completely
overhauled the British patent system and laid down a simplified
procedure for obtaining patents of invention. Legal fees were
substantially reduced and the issuing of separate patents for each
nation of the Union was replaced by the publication of a single UK
patent. The office of Comptroller General of Patents and a staff of
patent examiners were brought into being by a subsequent Act in 1883 to
carry out a limited form of examination; mainly to ensure that the
specification described the invention properly, but without any
investigation into novelty.

Subject: RSA
From: Dave
Date: 23 Oct 2002 21:14:08 +0100

The RSA story of the previous discovery at GCHQ is documented in `The
Code Book' by Simon Singh (ISBN 1-85702-889-9): ''By 1975, James
Ellis, Clifford Cocks and Malcolm Williamson had discovered all the
fundamental aspects of public-key cryptography''.  (RSA was 1977.)
''Cocks recalls: 'From start to finish, it took me no more than half
an hour.' ''.  There's probably more on this On The Web, but I haven't
had time to look.

While the work wasn't published (or even properly developed,
apparently), Diffie/Hellman/RSA public key cryptography was clearly
amenable to independent discovery at more-or-less the same time,
obviously not spurred on by any incentive of patents.

Another example is FFT, apparently basically done by Gauß rather
before it was patented.  (I don't remember where I found this)  
I guess this wasn't actual FFT, but
the basis of the divide-and-conquer approach.  Something that wasn't
patented was Tony Hoare's discovery of Quicksort, which was of great
influence in the important field of computer sorting, analogous to
FFT.  I can't remember whether he was actually attacking the problem
for essentially commercial reasons or not.

The basic question that policy makers have to ask is whether the
potentially iniquitous granting of patent monopolies in a particular
area is overall in the public good by encouraging research and
publication of the results.  (Originally patents were to counter the
trade secrets of the Guilds and the like by providing an incentive to
reveal the methods -- they were never meant to protect inventors, as
often said.)  While it's reasonable to think that's so in cases like
pharmaceuticals, it's implausible in most other areas, including
software/algorithms and there seems to have been no research to show
otherwise.  (That's even if the subject isn't trivial and/or
well-known.)  The RS should presumably be interested in such
experimental/observational questions.  I think Stallman's papers under
'philosophy' @www.gnu.org talk about this with reference to an
Economist article and a statement that (software?) patents are
basically only useful to IBM as an offensive weapon or, perhaps, a
defensive one, rather than encouraging innovation.

HTH.
