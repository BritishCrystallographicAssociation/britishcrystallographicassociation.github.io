<h2>From the Secretary<br>
 Announcement of Elections to Council in 2003</h2>
</center>
<P>
Old hands will know that we elect our Officers and Council members by secret
ballot at our AGM during the Spring Meeting. This year is the Big One in
this sense - we will elect a new President. The President serves for three
years, and should be a person that members feel can represent a broad swathe
of crystallographic interests. But we cannot afford to elect a figurehead;
the president has to chair the Council meetings and play a leading role in
developing the BCA still further. Our very distinguished and hard working
past Presidents have been:
<ul>
  <li>1982-1984 Professor David Phillips
  <li>1984-1988 Professor David  Blow 
 <li>
1988-1990 Professor Michael Woolfson
<li>
1990-1992 Dr Bob Diamond 
<li>
1992-1996 Professor Judith Howard
<li>
1996-2000 Professor Michael Glazer 
</ul>
<P>
Despite these dates, the President is now elected for a single three year term,
as is shown by the following extract from the Statutes

<P>
