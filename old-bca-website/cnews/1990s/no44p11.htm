<P>
John Iball came from Flintshire farming stock.</p>
<p>
He went to University College, Bangor, in 1925, completing his Honours
degree in Physics in 1928. After spending the next year doing a Teaching
Diploma he joined Professor Edwin Owen as a research student, obtaining his
M.Sc. (1930) and Ph.D. (1932) for X-ray studies on metals, using powder
photographs. 
</p><p>
    He moved to the Royal Institution (London) to work with Sir
William Bragg, the founder of modern crystallography in Britain.      John
Iball's work at the Royal Institution laid the foundation for a lifetime
interest in the molecular structure of cancer producing aromatic compounds.
This work continued at the Chester Beatty Research Institute and
subsequently in Dundee.     He developed the Iball Index relating structural
features of molecules to the danger of cancer from working with them.
</p><p>
After war service at the Rocket Range at Aberporth he worked briefly with
Unilever before coming to University College, Dundee, as Gibb Fellow of the
British Empire Cancer Campaign. This Fellowship was held first in the
Physics Department and later in the Chemistry Department.     No fewer than
six of his former students have lectured in the University of Dundee.
</p><p>
John finally retired in 1974 but he retained an active interest in research
and continued to publish his results for many years. He was always a welcome
and helpful visitor to the laboratory.     We believe that he published 99
papers but we are sure that John, as an excellent scientist, would enjoy the
estimate of error as +- 1 on that figure.
</p><p>
Apart from his academic work John realised the importance of explaining the
University to the wider community. He was active in 'Town and Gown'
relationships and was always eager to help local industry with any
scientific problems within his very wide interests.      He was involved in
the formation of the local section of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science and served as Chairman for many years.

John's wife Margaret predeceased him and he is survived by his only daughter
Dorothy.
