<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><BR>ADVERTISING  POLICY  FOR  CRYSTALLOGRAPHY  NEWS 1999<BR>
</H1>
<HR>
<P>
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY NEWS is a unique quarterly publication in that it represents
and reaches almost all crystallographers and crystallography laboratories in
the UK and is also sent to a number of crystallographers across the world;
we usually print over 850 copies. It is an ideal medium for advertising
meetings and commercial products used for such things as:

 <br><em>
Crystal growth, crystal/molecular models<br>
Crystallography Books<br>
X-ray and neutron diffraction cameras<br>
Crystallographic databases<br>
X-ray generators, safety systems<br>
Structure refinement software<br>
X-ray and neutron detectors<br>
Data analysis software<br>
X-ray diffractometers, special sample holders<br>
Molecular graphics software<br>
Electron diffraction systems<br>
Educational materials, or software<br></em>

<P>
<strong>The BCA Council has been able to keep the same rates as in 1998.
</strong> <br>
 <br>
The charging policy for full page (A5) commercial advertisements is that
original display material, normally contributed to the editor at A4 size,
will be included at the following rates, (price per page, per issue, in
&pound; sterling): <P>

For <strong>monochrome </strong>printing:<BR>    &pound;220 for a page
inserted in one, two, or three issues<BR>    &pound;180 for each page booked
in advance for four or more issues (one year) <P>

<strong>Colour printing </strong>is possible on the covers and centre pages,
<strong>add &pound;150 per page</strong> for any colour printing, and
contact the editor for details of the format which gives best colour
reproduction. <P>

<strong>Special positions: </strong>these are booked a year in advance; the
inside covers and centre spread are surcharged 15%, the back cover 20%.  <P>

<strong>Advertising leaflets </strong>and brochures can be mailed with
the<strong> <em>March</em></strong>and<strong><em>
June</em></strong>issues only; they should be A5 size or A4
already folded; rates are twice the current single page rate for monochrome
printing  for each item, (2 x &pound;220 = &pound;440) but if their extra
weight causes us to pay increased postage, an additional &pound;60 is
charged. <P>

<strong>Advertising copy </strong>should preferably be in the form of
complete line/text artwork with generous margins which reduces well from  A4
size.. Contrasty half-tone illustrations and photographs can be reproduced,
but are better supplied in the finished size (A5). Display Copy can be
accepted on PC disks, as TIFF, JPEG or PostScript files which the editor (or
printer) will print on an A4 or A5 page.  Files may also be sent
electronically to BCA@ISISE.RL.AC.UK; contact the editor for details.</p>

<p>
<strong>Colour Pages</strong>
Colour reproduction is possible on the cover and in the centre spread, which
are printed on glossier paper.
Advertisements are usually supplied in the A5 size (210 by 148.5 mm ).
They may be prints made from photographic negatives, 
(not digitally made prints) which the printer will
scan or electronically readable images on PC disc, GIF, TIFF, JPEG
or PostScript format. However, you probably get better reproduction from 
4 colour separations (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) on <em>
 positive film, right reading, emulsion down with a 175 screen.</em><br>
 The following sizes are
suggested:<br>
Trim size:  A5  210 x 148.5 mm<br>
Blleed size: allow at least an extra 3mm all round<br>
Dot size: 150 dots per inch <br>
</p>

<P ALIGN=CENTER> <strong><BR>POLICY ON 'SMALL ADS' and 'PRESS
RELEASES'<BR></strong> <HR> <P>

BCA Council policy is that 'For sale', 'Wanted' or 'Job' adverts from
academics, from non-commercial academic institutions or from charities will
be included free of charge as long as they are relevant to the interests of
BCA members. Any adverts from commercial organisations, whether or not they
have BCA members, will be charged at the appropriate page rate given above. 
We do not publish 'Press Releases' which are printed by the 'Journal of
Applied Crystallography' free of charge.
