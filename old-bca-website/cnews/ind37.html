<h3>The Historical Session - March 28th 1991</h3> 
<p>
This session was a delight to convene and an enormous pleasure to hear on
the final morning of the meeting. Our four speakers entertained and informed
a full lecture theatre most enjoyably. <strong>Arnold Beevers</strong>
 opened the morning
with <em>"Crystallography in Edinburgh after Crum Bmwn"</em>, which, with the
'knitted' model of sodium chloride and the 'coffins for dogs' idea (empty
Beevers-Lipson strip boxes!!), together with the remarks of Henry in the
audience, had the rest of us weeping with laughter - brilliant, Amold, thank
you! <strong>     John Robertson</strong>  followed with his <em>"Crystallographic Jokes, Jolts
and Reflections"</em>, giving a most eloquent and, in turn, philosophical view on
various highlights from our subject's history. His 'graphical aids' were
ingenious. <strong>Judith Milledge</strong> then presented a very splendid lecture <em>"A Flock
of Crazy Prophets"</em>, based on the life and work of Kathleen Lonsdale,
beautifully illustrated, not just in visual form, but with archival material
including the magnificent hand-written book of the original International
Tables work by Kathleen herself. It was a pleasure to see these and other
treasures of the past. Last, but by no means least, came <strong>Henry Lipson</strong> with
his talk entitled <em>"But man's reach should be beyond his grasp, or what's a
heaven for?"</em> in which he, so well and in a relaxed manner, gave us the other
half of the 'Beevers-Lipson Story', well documented with anecdotes from our
crystallographic forefathers.
<p>
Henry's lecture closed what had been quite a remarkable session and we were
delighted to have had the pleasure of hearing and watching the marvellous
Beevers-Lipson Duo again, especially as it turned out to be for the last
time. It is with deep regret that we learnt of Henry's death in Israel on
April 26th. This session will always mean something very special to those of
us who were fortunate enough to hear our four speakers on that morning.     
I congratulate them all for their eloquence and entertainment, and for the
scientific harvest which showed through in their obvious enthusiasm for the
subject and in the freshness of their presentations. As someone said to me
afterwards "Why didn't you video that session, it was magnificent !?" ......
yes,  it was.........è... why didn't I ???..!
