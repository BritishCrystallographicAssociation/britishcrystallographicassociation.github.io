   The product. <strong>crystallographica</strong> is designed to run on
IBM-compatible PCs (386 or higher, with at least 4 Mb RAM) under Windows
(3.x, NT or 95). It has been developed to provide a flexible resource for
those requiring access to crystallographic information and procedures.
Whilst there are features that are useful to fully-fledged crystallographers
the package is aimed principally at materials scientists and does not
presume or require more than a modest amount of crystallographic knowledge.
Essentially crystallographica is a Pascal interpreter, augmented by a large
number of special functions and procedures, combined with two plotting
packages--CrystalPlot to display the structure in hand and Graph to plot out
data. The Multiple Document Interface allows a number of windows to be open
simultaneously: besides CrystalPlot and Graph there can be Interpreter
windows for interactive access, Console windows for data input, Editor
windows for modifying Pascal scripts or datasets etc. The Graphical User
Interface is well exploited, the functions of icons (not too many, not too
small) are self-evident and the items in the pull-down menus are well
supported by on-line help if one's personal RAM dips in performance.
<p> 
<strong>Functions related to scattering handle X-rays or neutrons but not
electrons.</strong> A very useful procedure has been included that produces
the powder diffraction pattern of a specified material. A monochromatic
version is produced directly  whilst a Ka2 pattern may be added if
appropriate. crystallographica can also be used to generate the .ins files
that are required as input to the SHELXL structure refinement program. The
SHELXL output can be reimported, the structure viewed and an updated .ins
file produced.  <p> 
   <strong> Installation</strong> requires 5 Mb of free disk space. It is
initiated in Windows Program Manager and proceeds effortlessly, involving
little more than a few mouse clicks.  <p> 

<strong>    Use and testing.</strong> There are two ways in which the basic
data for a  crystal may be  entered: either by importing a .CIF file
(Crystallographic Information File),  a generous number of which have been
provided, or by entering atom types, positions, lattice parameters etc.
through dialogue boxes. All this information is stored in a Pascal `data
structure' and the program ensures that any changes made to these data do
not introduce any inconsistency--thus  if a lattice parameter change
violates a space-group assignment the latter  will be altered appropriately.
The structure may be observed via CrystalPlot,  atom radii and bonds
tailored to taste, viewing angle selected and so on. One small criticism
here is the lack of perspective-- a transformation that added  depth would
greatly help 3D visualisation.  <p> 
    To pass beyond the above minimum level of use brings the user up against
Pascal. Be not afraid! The first 47 pages of the manual constitute a
tutorial guide and provide plenty of simple examples of Pascal statements
and syntax. The final 46 pages comprise a substantial Pascal primer. Those
familiar with  the language will be reassured to know that a ** operator has
been implemented so that integral powers of numbers can be computed. The
execution of an interactive session is facilitated by an `alias' capability,
by name  completion using the ESC key and by a UNIX-like history feature
that allows short cuts to previous commands. Your reviewer, however, was
frequently frustrated by this mode of use and much prefers to write simple
Pascal scripts which may be added to the corpus of scripts already provided. 
<p> 
   My own use of crystallographica has largely been to simulate the X-ray
response of crystals to different perturbations: in-diffusion of ions from
electrodes in LiNbO3 and ion-disordering in KTiOPO4 under electric field and
inner displacement of atom positions in GaP under uniaxial stress. These all
involve tracking the behaviour of the structure factor. Effects can be made
vivid in CrystalPlot by linking colour with site-occupancy and in  Graph by
a plot-as-you-go build up. Incorrect hypotheses can be rapidly identified,
the script edited and a new run started. This work revealed a  serious
shortcoming of the program---anomalous dispersion is not handled correctly
in the vicinity of absorption edges so the structure factor may be wildly in
error. It is possible to get round this by entering one's own data into the
file USERPROF.i which is provided as a repository for any constants, data,
aliases etc. that one wishes to set up. The widely-available Cromer-Liberman
FPRIME program could be used for this purpose.<p>   
    In another task a colleague provided lists of atomic positions
representing exotic carbon structures, wishing to know the spacegroups. It
was simple to scan his data, deduce the structures were orthorhombic or
tetragonal and exhaust speedily the possibilities using crystallographica,
obtaining informative pictures at the same time. 
    All in all the product is very easy to use. <p><strong>    
Conclusions.</strong> This is a very well-conceived package, loads of 
crystallographically-secure procedures that the user can weld together to 
solve problems which would otherwise require time-consuming programming.  It
is especially good for simulation where the gradual effects of some change
may be clearly seen simultaneously in graphics and in plots. The powder
diffraction pattern feature will appeal strongly to the increasing numbers
of workers in high-pressure research, inter alia. I have some  reservations
about the quality of the hardcopy output from CrystalPlot but am informed
that the version 1.1 release (this review relates to 1.03) due later this
year will include the ability to export any crystal structure  drawing as a
VRML file. This can then be processed to give a Silicon Graphics-style
photo-realistic plot which may include thermal ellipsoids, polyhedra and
Miller planes in addition to standard features. (<em>Editor's Note: The VRML
ouput was on show at the IUCr in August 96, but the resolution of your
hardcopy may still be limited to that of your screen, unless you have a
smart Web Browser.</em>) 

<p>      Unlike software dedicated to limited tasks, an individual
crystallographica implementation will grow by the accumulation of the user's
own scripts, and thus become yet more powerful. An analogous process at the
developers' end should lead rapidly to a solution of the anomalous
dispersion problem mentioned above. <p>    <strong>   Value for
money.</strong> I think it's over-priced though I know of no other similar
product with which to compare it. However it's no more than the cost of an
electronic module that might form a very small part of the experimental
apparatus that produces the results that crystallographica is called upon to
analyse. Look on it as an instrument!    <p>  <strong>  Support </strong>is
available by email or fax.  Registered users are entitled to free upgrades
until the next major release of the product. In addition a space on the
<a href="http://www.demon.co.uk/oxcryo/cgraph.htm>Company's Web page </a>
 (http://www.demon.co.uk/oxcryo/cgraph.html) is devoted
to users' scripts. <br>    <em> Chris Cousins 4 July 1996</em>
