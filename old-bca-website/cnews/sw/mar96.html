Mac loving crystallographers with a fast graphics card and good eyesight
will love 'CrystalMaker', written by David Palmer, of the Earth Sciences
Department Cambridge, UK, primarily as a visualisation tool for first year
crystallography students in their Department. It will also be useful for
research workers since it displays structures so well; it does not attempt
to teach. (If you want a teaching program try the Geology TLTP module
'Crystallography' which runs on both Macs and Pcs. I hope to review it in a
later issue) 'CrystalMaker' is a very 'user-friendly' way for students to
explore various models of the atoms and bonds inside crystals, but not their
external morphology. 150 data files are supplied for students to explore the
crystal classes, and many general substances. However, if they are not to
just waste time admiring the pretty pictures, the teacher will need to
produce a set of worksheets to guide the explorations. A set of these on
disc, or as easily copied pages from the user manual would make a useful
addition. 
<p>
Installation and testing: 'Crystalmaker' is supplied in 3 versions, each
optimised to run on different types of Mac. With the help of friends in
Oxford and at RAL I tried all three, on a Mac II with 8Mb Ram a 14" colour
screen and a fairly full 80Mb hard disc, a Mac IIci with a monochrome A3
size screen normally used for word processing, and a PowerPC Model
(9500/132) with 17" colour screen. Installation was easy on the smaller
models, and easy on the bigger one after we read the 'Installation
instructions' again, looked at the 'readme' file supplied, and realised that
the Mac utility 'QuickTime' must be installed, so that the 'CrystalMaker'
movie option can be used later. This option makes a convenient way to set up
a sequence of operations illustrating points made during a lecture. An
example 'movie' is provided on the disc. The program follows the usual Mac
windows and pull down menus conventions. In addition it has the less usual
'toolbar' icons and information written into the lower 'window frame'.These
give very easy  access to on screen operations if you can see them; we all
found them too small for easy legibility, even on the large high resolution
screen.  Modelling options provided are stick, ball and stick, spacefilling
and polyhedral modes.The figure also shows the 'lasso' operation, where you
restrict the drawing to part of the structure by encircling the atoms you
want by drawing round them with the mouse pointer. Atom parameters such as
radius and colour are read from a default file but can be changed
interactively. Bonds, atoms and polyhedra can be displayed in various ways,
the selection is laid out for you in a window and you merely click your
mouse pointer over the one you want to use.  Entering a new crystal is easy,
we had no trouble following the 'tutorial' in the manual.   You can ask to
replicate the atoms over larger volumes, by specifying the minimum and
maximum distances to see in Angstroms. The x,y,z directions are treated
independently, so you have 6 real numbers to type. This gives great
flexibility, but I found it irritating when all I wanted was a whole number
of unit cell replications, and I thought one number should have been
sufficient. The program helpfully tells you how many unit cells your space
covers and how many atoms will be in the resulting diagram, so that you can
change your mind and ask for a smaller range if you are using a small
computer.  
<p>
We found interactive rotation of the structure with the mouse was a joy on
the PowerPc mac and impossibly slow on the other models when we had more
than a few atoms on the screen. A status window helpfully tells you what the
program is doing while you are waiting, and shows you a moving bar slowly
filling an icon; I would not want to use this program on macs without fast
graphics cards.
<p>
File formats:' CrystalMaker' reads only external files in the format of
'STRUPLO' or 'MacMolecule'. (Mac Molecule is freely available over the
InterNet from the University of Arizona by ftp from
joplin.biosci.arozina.edu).  It would be much more useful if it could handle
CIF files, or those from the large databases, CCDC, ICSD etc. It can save
files in its own format, which stores the plotting parameters last used with
the atom and bond positions, and subsequently loads much more quickly.
<p>
Hardcopy is via the Mac utilities. Pictures may be saved to files as bitmaps
in 'PICT' or in vectors in 'QuickDraw' formats or to the Mac 'clipboard' for
import into word processing packages. Elegantly rendered coloured shaded
models can be printed, or grey scale ones for publication. A 'print preview'
options allows plot inspection before printing. I found the high resolution
plots took a very long time to print, possibly because the Mac was connected
to a public printer served from a network. The lower resolution plots
printed with acceptable speed and quality for most purposes.    
<p>
Conclusion: Very good value for money if you have a Mac with a large screen
and a fast graphics card and you want a 'user friendly' package for
exploring crystal structures, with an option to make demonstration movies.
It is very much easier to use than the older mac program, 'Atoms', from
'Shape Software', but I would not throw away 'Atoms' yet because it can read
files in the formats from some of the large databases, draw atoms as thermal
ellipsoids (ORTEP like) and export pictures in PostScript format. This means
not only will they print more quickly over a network, but you can take your
file to a printing bureau with very high resolution PostScript printers and
produce a much better quality print for your Conference poster Annual Report
or presentation to funding bodies.

the BCA software pages to the URL where you can read another review, find
out how to get a free 'Demo' version of both 'CrystalMaker' and the
associated program 'CrystalDiffract'  which generates, displays and
manipulates x-ray powder diffraction patterns from the current structure in
'CrystalMaker'. <a href="http://geology.wisc.edu/-jill/geo360/silica.html>
