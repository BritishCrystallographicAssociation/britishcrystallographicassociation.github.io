<h1>SOFTWARE REVIEW</h1>

<h2>Space Groups for Windows</h2>
According to the sales brochure, 'Space Groups for Windows' is user-friendly
PC software designed for scientists, educators, and students in the fields
of Crystallography, solid state physics, solid state chemistry and material
sciences. <p>

Symmetry arguments not only greatly simplify calculations of a wide variety
of physical properties of solids such as structural, magnetic, electrical
and optical etc., but also often give a detailed insight into these
properties. It has therefore become increasingly important amongst research
workers to carry out a symmetry analysis besides carrying out any
experiment.<p>

<h3>Space Groups Program Features</h3>
With easy windows dialogs, featuring drop-down boxes, sliders and buttons,
the following tasks can be obtained for each of the 230 space groups listed
in the International Tables for crystallography:

<ul>
<li>General and special position tables and their three-dimensional graphic
representations. 
<li>Symmetry elements and their three-dimensional representation.
<li>Crystal builder: Build crystals while interacting with position and
symmetry tables
<li>Interactive dialog box to determine distances and angles among atoms.
<li>Miller planes
<li>Atomic colour and radius editors.
</ul>
Given the above main features of the Space Group Program and as it is often
very difficult to describe and visualize the symmetry operations, this
program can be regarded as an excellent teaching tool for new
crystallographers and solid state physicists. This can save a long time
reading through the text books and a lot of  tedious imagination which is
often required to understand the symmetry operations.<p>

<strong>Output Devices:</strong> The program supports most of the printers
available on Windows.

It can also create a variety of files such as Bitmaps which can be imported
by most of the word processing software including WordPerfect.
 
<strong>Hardware and System Requirements:</strong> Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or higher.
386 PC or higher with 4MB RAM minimum. No extended/expanded memory is needed.
