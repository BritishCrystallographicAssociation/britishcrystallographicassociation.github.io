Prices (excluding VAT and only a guide, contact supplier for current information):<br>
 DTMM itself £295 (if all additional libraries and utilities below are included £1115 )<br> 
Structure libraries £60 ~100 structures in each of:   Biochemistry, Organic chemistry, Pharmacology,    Biomacromolecules (includes polysaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins ) <br>
Structure Library £75 ~160 structures:  Inorganic chemistry, and the Symmetry Operator Program <br>
Additional DOS programs:<br> 
Symmetry Operator Program £150- applies symmetry operators and spacegroups to unit cell structures to generate crystals and lattices. Recognises all the standard space groups.<br> 
Protin £60- a utility for conversion of the PDB (Brookhaven) file format to DTMM<br>

 <br>
There was an earlier (non-windows version) which could be bought more
cheaply for use in secondary schools. Site licenses are available.<br> <hr>

<p>
DTMM is a molecular modelling program, allowing molecule synthesis, editing,
energy minimisation, manipulation and display on an IBM PC compatible
microcomputer. <p>
 
Minimum System requirements:  IBM 386 PC or compatible with a minimum of 4Mb
RAM, DOS version 5.0 or higher, 'Microsoft Windows' version 3.1,VGA or SVGA
monitor and graphics card,  Microsoft MS-DOS standard mouse (or compatible)
<p>

What do you get in package? one highly packed 3.5" PC floppy disc containing
1075Kbytes, including some example molecules and fragments, and an A5 spiral
bound manual with 170 pages. The manual has an index and a useful list of
mostly historical references on molecular modelling. The tutorial section
starts with 'Creating alanine and investigating chirality' and ends with
'Building a peptide and using secondary display styles' which continues with
an investigation of the docking facility. <p>

Installation: The manual sensibly advises one to make a backup of the
original disc and use the backup for installation, which was easy, although
it takes a while (I was testing it on a PC486SX  33MHz card in an Acorn
StrongARM RISC PC, with 16Mbytes memory in the PC partition). It is clever
enough to discover I do not have a math co-processor, which is recommended,
especially for those who want to use the energy minimisation features. <p>

File formats: DTMM reads crystal and orthogonal co-ordinate data from ASCII
files in a format compatible with the CSSR (Crystal Structure Search and
Retrieval) format. Files saved from DTMM can optionally include information
on atomic charge and type.   Protein Data Bank format files must be
converted using the additional utility (Protin) not tested in this review.
There is no mention of CIF files. Limits: DTMM allows up to 2700 atoms and
bonds without a co-processor which makes it more use in a teaching than a
molecular biology research environment.  <p>

Hardcopy output: is made via the 'Windows standard printing' devices, it may
be monochrome or colour. The usual printing option allows saving to an
Encapsulated Postscript (.EPS) file but this is merely a bitmap. The screen
may also be saved to the Windows 'clipboard' or as BMP bitmapped files. (An
earlier version used to produce real PostScript rather than these bitmaps
which use a lot of disk space if you want high resolution; it is a pity this
has not been carried over into Version 3.0. 'ATOMS' from Shape Software is
still he only PC program I know of which makes 'real' PostScript output
files, which have the advantage of small size and you can improve the
resolution of your output merely by printing the file on a higher resolution
printer. ) <p>

Display types:
<ul>
  <li> stick,
  <li> ball & stick, 
  <li> coloured line,
  <li> stereo (red/green and side by side)
  <li> space fill, 
  <li> shaded fill, 
  <li>coloured  by electrostatic charge or charge distribution. 
</ul>
For those who are used to the older version, new features in DTMM 3.0 are:
<ul>
  <li>docking of multiple structures
  <li>superposition
  <li>graphical display of energy terms during minimisation
  <li>calculation of volume & surface area
  <li>peptide build facility
  <li>display of secondary structural elements of proteins, helices as 
cylinders, sheets as large solid arrows
  <li>3 new display styles
    <ol>
      <li>charge distribution at van der Waals radius
      <li>space fill with light source shading 
      <li>space fill with shading to represent electrostatic potential 
(needs 256 colours)
      <li>fuse ring command facility for changing the chirality of stereoisomers
      <li>annotate any display with text and arrows
  </ol>
</ul> 
DTMMShow is a utility to save 'Slides' to disc and replay later as a
continuous demo. These just save the screen as bitmapped files (.BMP) so use
a lot of disc space.  No example files were supplied so I did not test this
feature. I used an earlier version successfully for RAL Open Days some years
ago. <p>

Conclusions:  DTMM itself is aimed at organic molecule synthesis, not at
crystallographic structures. There is no display type showing parts of the
structure as polyhedra, and no example datafiles of lattice structures
supplied. (These may be included with the 'Inorganic' Structure Library
which was not supplied for this review.) Plain DTMM could be used as a
teaching aid for students of organic chemistry to learn about molecular
modelling. <br>
