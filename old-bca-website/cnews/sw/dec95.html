ModelMaker for Windows SB Technology's ”ModelMaker for Windows•, Version 2.0
is published by Cherwell Scientific Publishing Ltd., The Magdalen Centre,
Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GA, U.K., and retails for £349, ex. VAT,
with an academic discount of 15% and special rates for department licenses.
It comes complete on a single 3.5" floppy disc with a detailed reference manual
and installation instructions. It runs on an IBM PC or clone under MS-DOS
and Windows.
<p>
ModelMaker is designed as a model building package for solving differential
equations numerically. At the heart of the package is a numerical integrator
(called a ”compartment•) around which the user builds a model of a system of
interest. The compartments (there can be a number of them) interact with
other components of the model system, such as ”parameters•, ”variables•,
”defined values• and ”events•, by means of ”flows• and ”influences•, which
determine how each component interacts with the others. Flows and influences
have a direction associated with them so that the result of a calculation in
one component can be available to a second component, but the result of the
second component may not be available to the first. Parameters and variables
can be defined as ”global• which means they are available to all components,
but this fact is not obvious from a casual inspection of the screen alone.
It is also possible to include ”delays• and ”lookups• into the model.

Figure 1. Model diagram produced by ModelMaker. Square boxes represent
compartments (integrators), rounded boxes represent variables (no
integration) and angular boxes represent defined values. The model in this
case was a set of six particles moving in one dimension and coupled together
by harmonic forces, (force constant k). Each particle has a position, h, a
velocity, v, and an acceleration, a. In addition each particle is subject to
a damping force proportional to velocity, with constant d. The problem is
subject to periodic boundary conditions (particle 1 sees particle 6, and
vice versa) and so is a 1-dimensional representation of a benzene ring.
Particle 1 is subject to a sinusoidal oscillation, h1, whose frequency, F,
increases linearly with time. The problem is to ascertain the motion of the
remaining 5 particles.
<p>
In the main window is a diagram of the problem currently being solved which
shows all the components (with different shaped boxes to signify the
different component types) and arrows to signify the flows and influences
that are defined. The direction of the arrow indicates which way the
influence goes (see Figure 1). If there is a logical error in the way the
model has been set up then the offending boxes remain shaded until the error
is corrected. This is very helpful in ensuring that the model is internally
consistent, but of course it does not ensure that the model represents what
you want it to. The model will not ”run• until all the errors are corrected,
but once this is done and all initial values are defined the model can be
run by simply pressing ”run•. When the run is complete the results can be
plotted using a limited graphics routine, from which hardcopy can be made if
needed (see Figure 2). The length of the run varies considerably depending
on the complexity of the problem being solved.
<p>
Installation on a PC system was quick and straightforward. The programme
comes with a detailed manual which contains full descriptions of all the
facilities available in the package. However the introductory part of the
manual uses the example of a lake system to develop familiarity with the
methods and terminology used. To go through this example in full would
require a considerable amount of reading and testing and is not really
suitable for someone in a hurry to set up a particular problem. The same
example can be loaded as a tutorial item from disk. The description of the
integrator as a ”compartment• is fairly obscure to the novice - why not
simply call it an ”integrator•?. Other descriptions are perhaps not so
obscure but there is certainly a case to try and standardize the use of
terminology in the package to make the function of the different facilities
more immediately obvious to the novice. In practice this did not appear to
be a serious obstacle since the terminology became familiar enough once the
function of each component was understood.
<p>
Figure 2 Graphic output from ModelMaker, using the model described in Figure
1. The bottom line shows the driving oscillation, h1, with a small amplitude
of motion and a frequency which increases steadily with time. The other
lines show the response of the remaining 5 particles. At a certain driving
frequency (the first resonance) all the particles move in phase with an
amplitude much larger than the driving amplitude - the system is absorbing a
large amount of energy at this frequency. At another, higher frequency,
again resonance is observed, but this time only half the particles have
large amplitude motions and they are out of phase with one another. Thus the
phenomena of resonance and normal motion are demonstrated by this simple
technique.
<p>
The overall time taken to set up the problem shown in figures 1,2 plus a
separate problem of integrating a complicated function, and to become fully
familiar with running both problems, was about 10 hours for someone who had
no prior experience of ModelMaker nor of other integration packages. For
someone familiar with the package the time would be much less, (e.g. ½
hour), but for any particular problem the time consuming element will likely
be the initial breakdown of the problem into its ModelMaker component parts.
This may not be totally trivial when it is realised that each integrator can
only solve an equation of the form:
<p>
<pre>
        dv/dt= (algebraic expression)

</pre>
Therefore if the package were to be used to solve a complex problem the user
will need to have a good grasp of differential equations. It will probably
also help if he or she knows something about solving differential equations
numerically. This fact is not brought out in the manual, which is written as
if the user would need to have only a superficial understanding of
differentiation and integration. There is possibly a case for a ”front end•
package to break down a complex problem into its ModelMaker components, but
this might be awkward to implement in practice.
<p>
The problem shown in Figure 1 contains a number of compartments which have
identical algebraic expressions - only the variable names change. If the
problem were to be extended to say double the number of particles it would
be necessary to laboriously define each component one by one. There is no
facility within the package to reproduce a given component several or many
times with different variable names, in a manner that is possible in say a
FORTRAN program where the same operation can be carried out on a large
number of elements. The graphics routine is versatile in allowing the user
to display any quantity in the model against another over any range of the
variables, but has little scope for labelling the graph, altering the
character size and changing line thicknesses. To do this the user would have
to unload the results into a file and plot them off-line.
<p>
The availability of a reliable and accurate integrator on a desktop computer
can be a powerful tool for developing models or parts of models, even if at
the end of the day the full model is solved in the conventional way using
computer programming. I would have the thought the applications of
ModelMaker to the kind of problems encountered by crystallographers would be
fairly limited, given the size of a typical crystallography dataset, but as
a general learning tool about numerical integration and as means of
developing solutions to particular problems it could be very powerful.

<h1>COMMENTS FROM THE SUPPLIER</h1>

The minor criticisms of graphing facilities and component duplication will
be addressed in version 3.0
<p>
All calculated values from tables and graphs can be transferred to other
Windows applications for further analysis, graphing etc. using the Windows
clipboard. This is very much more straightforward than writing values to a
file as suggested in the review
<p>
Global components are indicated in the diagram by green cross hatching which
makes them more obvious than suggested in the review.
<p>
Components can be reproduced several times by using copy and paste
