<h2>Editor's Archive</h2>
Earlier newsletters were issued by the X Ray Analysis 
Group (XRAG) of the Institute of Physics, starting in May 1957. The current 
series began in March 1981. The editor is
collecting an Archive of Past issues to be maintained by the current editor.
In the Archive so far there are:
<ul>
  <li> Institute of Physics Xray Analysis Group newsletters, There
 were one or two pages, issued at arregular intervals. No.s 1 to 29 were
foolscap size, then at no. 30 it became A4 size. At no.35 Jan 1970
 the name changed to Crystallography Group.
    <ul>
      <li> numbers 1 - May 1957, 2 - August 1957, <em>No. 3 missing</em> 1957?
      <li>  4 - Jan 1958 to  8 - Nov 1958,<em> No.  9 missing</em>
