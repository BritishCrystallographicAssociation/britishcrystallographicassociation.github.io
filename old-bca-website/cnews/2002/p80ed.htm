The 3 news items in this article are:

The main education page on the BCA website is  <BR><strong>
<a href="../../ed/index.html">http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/ed/index.html</a>
</strong> which now has links to 2 new pages:
<ul>
  <li> one for news at <a href="../../ed/news.html">.../BCA/ed/news.html</a> 
  <li>the other with instructions for making 3 different kinds of your 
own 3D card model crystals at
 <a href="../../ed/model.html">.../BCA/ed/model.html</a>
</ul>
<P>
 The <B>models</B> are calcite, a mobile showing all the Platonic solids and
a set of rhombic dodecahedra and bases to show how these polyhedra fill
space.

Calcite planar net,  completed mobile,  completed base with rhombic
dodecahedra

<P>
The calcite is an example of a single A4 page with the planar net of the
solid, a 3D shaded view of it, some 'wire' diagrams and some of the symmetry
axes illustrated with the standard symbols. Please look at it and let me
have your comments, and suggestions as to what other 'crystals' your
students would like. The only the Platonic solid which fills space is the
cube, others can fill space if you use more than one of them. Many viruses
are icosahedral in shape, so making an icosahedron may be a useful exercise
for students of biological structure. I hope to make more spacefilling
polyhedra soon.

This supplier markets a set of plastic tubes which can be connected together
with a variety of 'hubs' to make polyhedra, much like the Cochrane model
kits. I tested the 'Solar System' kit (price &pound;7.99) which has 130
parts: 70 40mm long tubes, and 20 each of 3,4 and 5 way connecting hubs. The
hubs have a hollow underneath the centre and a small knob on the top, so
that polyhedra can be built inside one another or connected at their
vertices. These components are all the same colour, a milky white; they will
glow in the dark for a short while after they have been in light for some
time. The supplier says that tubes in other colours, a cutting tool and 6
way connectors will be available soon. The hubs are not rigid, their arms
may be bent which allows flexible model building, but I can see that they
may become weak with constant use and then snap off.  Triangles are made
easily, but polygons with more sides tend to become twisted.

<P>
The documentation consists of 2 double sided A4 pages. You should read the
one printed in black and white first, it has instructions for assembling the
models, including how to connect and disconnect two hubs, with a caution
<B>to be gentle</B> when pulling models apart otherwise the hubs may break.
Brief instructions are given for making each of the Platonic solids, it is
probably a good idea to make those first to find out the problems.  My model
cube was not rigid and tended to go out of square alignment. The octahedron
was better and it can be constructed inside a cube which may help some
doubting students to believe that the cube and octahedron have the same
symmetries. It is not easy to bend the arms of all the hubs to the correct
angle; my rhombic dodecahedron had the right topology but non-planar sides! 
My attempt to construct quartz is shown in the image below, it is made from
tetrahedra linked at their corners; with more pieces and a lot of patience
one might be able to model zeolites.

<P>
The instructions are only concerned with how to make a particular model,
they lack any references to the mathematical theory of polyhedra, which are
treated as artistic creations with no indication of where polyhedra occur in
the natural world. The coloured A4 page of the documentation shows the
possibilities of making larger coloured polyhedra using differing lengths of
tube and combining more than one kit. The supplier invites any user who
makes a polyhedron not shown on their website to enter it in their
competition by sending an image to the website together with instructions on
how to make it. 

<P>
This kit is not recommended for children under 6 because of the smallish
parts. However, it is sufficiently cheap that any undergraduate should be
able to afford a set and use it to appreciate 3D structures. Teachers who
want to make particular polyhedra can ask for a quotation for larger kits
suitable for the whole class.  Every college bookstore should stock these
kits to help undergraduates understand structures better.

<B>The latest catalogue, Tarquin Mathematics 2002,</B> has new resources.
They are now agents for the 'Polydron' kits of fixed sized solid plastic
polygons, (triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons) which can snapped
together to make 3D solids. The polygons have the same length of side so
that you can make polyhedra with them from more than one type of polygon. A
newer product, 'Frameworks', consists of polygons made with just plastic
edges; they are compatible with the solid shapes and can be used to make
'see through' polyhedra. The price depends on the size of kit you want; you
can order from the website.

<P>
They have just started to sell wooden manipulative puzzles, one of which can
be used to illustrate the packing of spheres; 20 polished wooden balls are
stuck together in 4 pieces, the puzzle is to assemble them into a pyramid on
the triangular wooden base. Price &pound;7.50. A set of small polyhedra dice
are cheaper; for &pound;1.80 you can buy a set of the 5 Platonic solids and
a 10 sided double pyramid.

<P>
They have reprinted the <strong>'Altair Designs'</strong>
 colouring pads which can be used to
teach symmetry and have other books for teaching tessellations 

<P>
Personally I liked the set of five A5 sized books by Robert Field (price
&pound;2.95 each) <strong>'Geometric Patterns from:', Roman Mosaics,
Churches and Cathedrals, Tiles and Brickwork, Islamic Art and Architecture
and Patchwork Quilts. </strong>
They all have photographs and diagrams which could
make useful illustrations for student projects to decide on the symmetry of
the object shown and help students to realise that symmetrical objects are
all around them. 

<P>
I will try to bring examples of the items described in this article to the
Annual meeting in Nottingham for your inspection, come and try out them out
for yourselves at my poster.

<P>
I hope to make this page a regular item of the newsletter; this news will
also accumulate on the BCA Website please send educational news items to me
preferably by email to
 BCA@isise.rl.ac.uk
