<h3>Memorial meeting for Max Perutz</h3>
<h4>Cambridge, 21 September, 2002</h4>

Max Perutz spoke on mutant haemoglobins at a meeting in the Royal Society in
1969. The warmth, wit, charm and intellectual rigour of his
talk were decisive in directing me into crystallography.
The recent memorial meeting for Max was outstanding for 
the inspiring, heartfelt and moving nature of the many 
tributes to Max,  from
his colleagues, collaborators, friends and family. The event
included a beautiful performance of a Brahms
clarinet trio, with Max‘s grandson Tim playing the
clarinet. John Meurig Thomas, who spoke first in the personal
tributes, has very kindly given permission for part of his lecture
to be included here. You can <a href="mp.htm">read it in full</a> on the 
BCA Website.</p>
