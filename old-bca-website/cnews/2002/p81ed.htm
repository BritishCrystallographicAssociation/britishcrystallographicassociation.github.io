Report of the Education SIG</STRONG>

<HR>
<P>
On Monday 25th March 2002 there was a short discussion on Crystallographic education which began with brief reports of existing activities of the BCA Groups and the Education Officer.
<P>
<EM>Sandy Blake (Nottingham) </EM>told us about the <B><I>Intensive Courses in X-Ray Structural Analysis </I></B>organised by the CCG, (Chemical Crystallography Group). These grew out of an idea first discussed in 1985 by Michael Woolfson, David Watkin and Judith Howard who thought there was a need for theoretical and practical education in crystallography for graduates and young scientists. The first course was held in 1987; they are residential, last about a week and run every two years, in Aston until 1995 and in Trevelyan College, Durham, since then. The teaching staff are present for the whole week, and unpaid. There are 4 or 5 lecturers, about 10 tutors and between 70 and 80 students, mostly from Britain but foreign students are admitted if they have funding and space permits. Sponsorship for the course has been provided by the EPSRC, the IUCr and industry. Lectures are usually followed by a tutorial and then a break. The tutorial groups are a key element of the course with students and tutors staying in the same group throughout the course. Although the students work hard there is a strong social element, usually mixed with science ( a bar quiz, an expert panel or a ceilidh). Many friendships begin, even a marriage or two, the strong international element chimes with the aims of the IUCr. Students (and others) learn how crystallography is done elsewhere. The next course is to be held <B><I>7th-14th April 2003</I></B>, details will be found on the CCG pages of the BCA website.
<P>
<EM>Jeremy Cockcroft, (Birkbeck College, London) </EM>spoke on behalf of the Industrial Group for whom he has given short introductory and refresher courses during BCA Annual meetings and the Physical Crystallography Group (PCG). He described the <B><I>Internet Crystallographic Teaching courses</I></B> run by Birkbeck College, students learn most of their work in their own time via the Internet. This is a natural extension of the work of Birkbeck College which runs many part time and evening course for students in full time employment. The first Internet Course was in protein crystallography run for biological scientists. A newer one is the <B><I>Powder Diffraction</I></B> course for Physical Scientists. This is a one year part-time Distance Learning Course at MSc level, students gain an Advanced Certificate which forms about 50% of the work for an MSc. There are 2 terms of taught material and a one term computer based project. The first term teaches the Basics of crystallography, instrumentation, diffraction and symmetry. The second term is concerned with Data Collection, Analysis and publication, including how to prepare pages for reports using the language of the World Wide Web, HTML. The students assessment is made up of 20% Coursework in HTML, 30% project and 50% the examination paper. The Course is not free; students pay fees. Details can be found on the Birkbeck Web site.
<P>
(***********BSG Group Courses, I couldn't find a BSG speaker, but Richard Pauptit said he would try to get someone to write a paragraph or so for me, if he doesn't remember, just use the following paragraph********)
<P>
The Biological Structures Group also run residential 'Summer Schools' covering all aspects of protein structure determination using X-ray crystallography. These are aimed at graduate students in their first or second year of Ph.D study. They are run annually in September, one year in Bristol, the next in St.Andrews mainly for students in the North of the UK.
<P>
Kate Crennell then spoke about her work in trying to encourage young children to play with crystallographic toys, in the hope that as adults they may become crystallographers. This has been described in past issues of 'Crystallography News'. This was followed by a general discussion, during which it emerged that although we all thought that crystallography was being squeezed out of undergraduate courses no one had any statistics so the education officer agreed to survey the membership via the newsletter, mount a survey form on the BCA website and to attempt an email survey of UK academic institutions.
<P>
******************************
<P>
Please complete the form below and post it to the BCA Education officer
<P>
XXXXXXXXXput form here.
<P>
If possible, also print the form on a separate sheet to be inserted with the newsletters sent to UK addresses only.
<P>

The form is available on the BCA website in electronic form at http://bca,cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/ed/survey/.

CD-ROMS for Secondary Schools from the IoP<BR>
The Institute of Physics (IoP) newsletter for April 2002, 'Physics World' carried an article on what the Institute is doing to tackle the shortage of specialist physics teachers in secondary schools in the age range 11-14 year olds. The IoP are planning to develop a set of between 10 and 12 CD-ROMS to cover the physics components for each UK science curriculum. Each CD-ROM will have a "physics story" discussing key aspects of specific topics supported by video clips, ideas for innovative practical exercises, computer simulations, downloadable worksheets, references to further reading and a section on common misconceptions. For more information, contact the education manager by email: catherine.wilson@iop.org
<P>
I have suggested one of these CD-ROMS should be about crystallography and its relevance to today's technological world.

Winners of model kits<BR>
Thanks to the generosity of Cochranes of Oxford (http://www.cochranes.co.uk) who supplied model kits for delegates to try at the 'Education Poster' at the Annual meeting in Nottingham, I had 3 'Orbit system' kits to give away, one of 'Lattices' and two of 'Biochemistry' . I decided the simplest way to do this was to have a Prize Draw, the winners were David Watkin, University of Oxford, David Russell, University of Leicester and Nicola Farley, University of Nottingham.
