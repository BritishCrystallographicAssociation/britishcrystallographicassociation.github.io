<h3>Helen D. Megaw<br>
1907-2002</h3>
</center>
</p>
<p align=left>
Dr. Helen Megaw,  born on June 1st 1907, died on February 26th at the age of
94. She was a well- known, highly respected and remarkable member of one of
the most important scientific disciplines of the 20th century, namely the
field of Crystallography. In her own words, this is îthe branch of science
concerned with the description of the structure and properties of condensed
matter in terms of the spatial relationships of atoms and interatomic forces
in an extended arrayï. I should explain that the term êextended arrayë means
a îcrystalï for it is the repeated stacking of molecular units in all
directions that distinguishes a crystalline solid from non-crystalline
substances like glass.
</p>
<p>
Helen was born into a distinguished Northern Irish family: her father was a
famous judge and Ulster politician. In addition her uncle was a director of
the Indian Medical Service, one brother built the Mersey tunnel, the
Dartford tunnel, the Victoria line and Battersea power station, another
brother was a Justice in the Court of Appeal, and one of her sisters
researched diet and health in the 1930ës and marriage laws in Uganda in the
1950ës. Helen decided on a scientific career, starting first at Queenës
University, Belfast before moving to Girton College, at the University of
Cambridge, to obtain her BA and PhD. From 1930 to 1934 she was a research
student under the great, and some would say êinfamousë, J.D. Bernal, along
with Dorothy Crowfoot, later Hodgkin. Although she had already become
interested in Crystallography while at school, having read Braggës  X-rays
and Crystal Structure, Bernal was a stimulating influence on her and happily
confirmed her interest in crystals. Her choice of Crystallography was a wise
one, because it was the one scientific discipline at the time that had
already established itself as a place  in  which  both  men  and women 
could  engage  on  an equal basis, and she never, or rarely, was aware of
any form of discrimination. She began her scientific career in the study of
crystals by working on the structure of ice. The naming of an Antarctic
island, Megaw Island, in her honour marked this work. If you want to find
it, look at 66∞55ëS, 67∞36ëW.
</p>
<p>
In 1934 Helen spent a year in Vienna and then moved to work briefly under
Professor Francis Simon at the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford. This was
followed by two years of school teaching before taking up a position at
Philips Lamps Ltd in Mitcham in 1943. It was here that she worked out the
crystal structure of a very important industrial material, barium titanate,
which is used in capacitors, pressure sensitive devices and in a variety of
other electrical and optical applications. This material, which crystallises
in the so-called perovskite structure, belonged to the class of materials
known as ferroelectrics, originally discovered around 1935. This structure
is so famous and important that Helenës name is permanently associated with
it and with perovskite structures in general. In 1945, she moved back to
Birkbeck College London, once again to work with Bernal, and in the
following year, she was appointed to a post in the Cavendish Laboratory,
Cambridge, where she remained for the rest of her scientific life.
</p>
<p>
At that time, the Cavendish Laboratory was under the leadership of the great
William Lawrence Bragg, and as a result Helen found herself at a place where
many important and well- known Crystallographers would pass through. She was
there during the exciting double-helix days. However, she remained loyal to
her chosen field of mineralogy and inorganic crystals. In 1951, Helen was
responsible for providing a number of crystal structure diagrams to the
Council of Industrial Design, which were then used in the designs for the
textiles used at the Festival of Britain, including in the foyer of the
Regatta Restaurant. In 1957, Helen wrote a book entitled simply
îFerroelectricity in Crystalsï, the first of its kind, and for many years
this became the bible for the fast growing international community of
Ferroelectricians. A second book followed years later entitled îCrystal
Structures: a Working Approachï, a fine text that illustrates well her
unique approach to describing the architecture of crystals.  In addition to
ferroelectrics, by suggestion of W.H. Taylor (WHT), she took up an interest
in the crystal structure of feldspars. These complicated materials make up
most of the earthës and moonës surface, and are therefore of great
significance in earth sciences. The first structure determination had been
carried out by WHT before the war, but such is the complexity of this class
of materials, there remained a great deal of unknown science to discover.
</p>
<p>
In 1989, Helen became the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Roebling
Medal of the Mineralogical Society of America, and in 2000 at the age of 93
she was awarded an honorary degree at Queenës University, Belfast.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, now I can turn to my own involvement with Helen Megaw. I first met
her in 1969 while at an international conference in Stony Brook, USA. She
was looking for a postdoctoral assistant to work on crystal structure
changes with temperature in a particular complicated perovskite material.
Kathleen Lonsdale, who had been my Ph.D. supervisor in London, had
recommended me to her. At the time I was working at the Chemistry Department
in Harvard and my interest was in the crystallography of organic compounds.
I therefore accepted Helenës offer with some reluctance, because I felt that
the subject of inorganic crystals was far too impenetrable for me.
</p>
<p>
However, I soon discovered that my boss was a remarkable person: formidable
in some ways, but also very kind and patient. She had a particularly
interesting gift: if you wanted to know what a particular crystal structure
looked like from any particular direction, she could somehow turn it around
in her mind and then sketch it for you. In the days before computer
graphics, this was a very useful trick, especially for a crystallographer,
who must somehow always be able to appreciate three-dimensional
architecture.

</center>

Another personal story shows something of Helenës scientific honesty. In
1972 I wrote a paper on the structures of perovskites, which I thought was
rather clever, and sent it for publication. Eventually I received a reply
from the Editor with a refereeës report of 20 closely written pages of
criticism! I was infuriated: how dare a mere referee pull my work apart like
that! So, I went to Helen for advice, complaining bitterly about the referee
and his attitude. She looked carefully through the comments and agreed that
they were indeed over the top. Anyway, she spent hours with me helping me to
deal with the comments and eventually the revised paper was sent back. I had
to admit that the paper was in fact much better as a result, and
subsequently it became one of my most widely quoted pieces of published
works. It was a few years later that Helen confided to me that she had been
the original referee! The Editor had sent it to her in error and she had
pointed this out, but at the same time said that she could be objective
nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
 I continued to work  with Helen until her retirement in 1972. She retired
to her home in Ballycastle to pursue her other interest, gardening.  I
recall how delighted she was to discover the plant called Perovskia, and
this quickly made its way into her garden collection. Leaves of Perovskia
featured on one of her Christmas cards. Helenës death marks the passing of
an era in science. In the words of Professor Robert E. Newnham of
Pennsylvania State University: îAlong with Kathleen Lonsdale and Dorothy
Hodgkin, Helen Megaw is one of the grand old British school of women
crystallographers who serve as role models for many of us ó men and women
alikeï.

<h3>Max Ferdinand Perutz</h3>
<IMG src="images/mp.jpg" ALT="Max Perutz"  VSPACE=2><br>
<h3>1914 - 2002</h3>
</center>
<p><em>
By permission, we reproduce here the appreciation first submitted to The
Independent by David Blow and published on 7 February 2002.</em>
</p>
<p>
A young Viennese chemist from a Jewish family, who arrived in Cambridge in
1936 to study under Desmond Bernal, Max Perutz became the leader of the
movement which created molecular biology, and the head of the most
successful research laboratory in Britain.
</p>
<p>
Throughout his life, his personal research focused on haemoglobin, a
familiar protein molecule whose extraordinary range of properties
illuminated every stage of the scientific development leading from
spectroscopy and protein chemistry through three- dimensional structure to
molecular genetics and medical application.
</p>
<p>
His achievements followed from a combination of several outstanding
qualities, not all intellectual. His irresistible powers of gentle
persuasion brought him long-term support from the Cavendish Professor of
Physics at Cambridge, Sir Lawrence Bragg, and from the Secretary of the
Medical Research Council, Sir Edward Mellanby, setting up a Medical Research
Council Unit in 1947 for his work. He communicated ideas with extraordinary
clarity and simplicity. Though he retained a strong Austrian accent, his
written English was always elegant, compelling and stimulating. He seemed to
write with a golden pen. He had a wonderful way of leading research, leaving
his staff with the feeling they were free to decide their own way forward,
while he created a vision of the long-term goals. And he had uncanny insight
into the potential of young researchers seeking to work with him.
</p>
<p>
By the early 1950s he had drawn together an extraordinary group of people.
His senior colleague was John Kendrew, like Max a chemist trained in
crystallography, but in personality utterly different. Kendrew was a precise
organiser, a gifted computer programmer, a man who knew exactly where he was
going and how to get there. His research began by following Max's, but by
brilliant organisation it later overtook him (by working on myoglobin, the
much smaller brother of haemoglobin). There was also a PhD student with a
degree in physics, whose dazzling intellect constantly darted from problem
to problem. This man was Francis Crick. A postdoctoral researcher, a
22-year-old whizz kid named Jim Watson, turned up from Chicago. 
</p>
<p>
Only 10 years later, Max Perutz and these three colleagues were all Nobel
prizewinners. Max shared the Chemistry prize with Kendrew for their
structural analyses of haemoglobin and myoglobin, and in the same year Crick
and Watson (with Maurice Wilkins) won the prize for Medicine.   But in the
early 1950s all these men were unknown, achievements unrecognised, seeking
how to use the techniques of physics and chemistry to understand the nature
of biological matter. 
</p>
<p>
There were other remarkable people in the group. Hugh Huxley studied with
Max using the primitive electron microscopes then in existence. With
brilliant insight, they decided Huxley should study muscle, an object
ideally matched to the powers of the microscope. In his doctoral thesis in
1954, Hugh Huxley laid out the basic mechanism of muscle contraction. And
Max's biochemical assistant, Vernon Ingram, was to discover the precise
molecular nature of sickle- cell disease a couple of years later -- a change
of one amino-acid in haemoglobin which we now recognise as the consequence
of a single mutation. 
</p>
<p>
The group first came to prominence with the achievement of the two young
rebels -- Crick and Watson's analysis of DNA in 1953 revealed an exquisite
structure whose fascinating implications caught the imagination immediately.
Meanwhile Max's own research (and that of Kendrew) had got stuck. The
methods of X-ray crystallography had been used to picture the molecular
structure of many small molecules, up to the size of penicillin. Perutz and
Kendrew wanted to use these methods on haemoglobin (and its partner in
muscle, myoglobin). But the methods that worked for the smaller molecules
seemed hopeless for these much larger structures.
</p>
<p>
While the DNA structure was being worked out, Max had a shattering insight
for his own work. If he could attach a heavy atom to a specific site in the
haemoglobin molecule, and if it didn't disrupt the structure of the
molecule, and if he could make it crystallise in just the same way as
ordinary haemoglobin, and if it made changes big enough to measure -- if all
these things were true, he could see a way to use the methods of X-ray
crystallography to image the haemoglobin molecule. He later wrote:
</p>
<p>
<em>
"As I developed my first X-ray photograph of mercury haemoglobin  my mood
altered between sanguine hopes of immediate success and desperate
forebodings of all possible causes of failure. I was jubilant when the
diffraction spots appeared in exactly the same position as in the
mercury-free protein, but with slightly altered intensity, exactly as I had
hoped."<br>
(Perutz, 1992)</em></p>
<p>
The rest, as they say, is history. Crick and Watson's work led to the
discovery of the genetic code, development of molecular genetics, methods to
make bacteria produce large quantities of useful proteins such as specific
antibodies, towards ways to clone stem cells. The work of Max Perutz led to
an understanding of proteins themselves. These are the molecules which DNA
specifies. They are also the molecules which control all chemical processes
in a living cell and organise its structure. His methods have now been
applied to tens of thousands of different proteins, giving clear insights
into their mode of action.
</p>
<p>
In the late 1950s, after Bragg's retirement, Perutz's Unit was based in a
small asbestos hut in the car park outside the Cavendish Laboratory in
Cambridge. As the research group continued to grow, every empty room and
disused shed on the site (including the building which was originally Lord
Rutherford's stable) was converted to a laboratory for a different facet of
molecular biology. Long before the Nobel Prizes, a report by Perutz
convinced the Medical Research Council, then led by Sir Harold Himsworth, to
build a large new laboratory for Perutz, Crick, Fred Sanger and others. The
new building, known as the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, was completed in
1962 on the new site of Addenbrooke's Hospital, at the edge of Cambridge --
just in time before over-population of the Cavendish site led to any serious
dispute.
</p>
<p>
The Laboratory of Molecular Biology has been an outstanding and continuous
success, a breeding-ground for scientific achievement. In addition to the
four Nobel Prizes awarded in 1962, which set the laboratory off to a
splendid start, it has appeared in the Nobel lists again and again: for the
creation of monoclonal antibodies by Cesar Milstein and Georges Kˆhler with
immediate application to medicine, for Aaron Klug's deep analysis of the
organisation of nucleic acids in chromatin and other types of nucleic acid
structure, John Walker's long study of a beautiful protein (ATP synthase)
which acts as a rotary dynamo which stores biochemical energy, and above all
Fred Sanger's second Nobel Prize for inventing ways to find the sequence of
bases in nucleic acids.
</p>
<p>
These are only the most visible of the laboratory's successes. Max has left
some clues to its achievements:<br>
</p>
<p><em>
"I persuaded the Medical Research Council to appoint me Chairman of a
Governing Board, rather than as Director . . . This arrangement reserved
major decisions of scientific policy to the Board, and left their execution
to me . . . The Board met only rarely .. . This worked smoothly and left me
free to pursue my own research. Seeing the Chairman standing at the
laboratory bench or the X-ray tube, rather than sitting at his desk, set a
good example and raised morale. The Board never directed the laboratory's
research but tried to attract, or to keep, talented young people and gave
them a free hand."<br>
(Perutz, 1995)<em>
</p>
<p>
He always recognised the importance of new instrumental developments, and
maintained large mechanical and electronic workshops, to which research
workers had full access, directly passing their enthusiasm to the technical
staff. The most characteristic feature was the tearoom, open to all, visited
three times a day by most, an important centre for exchange of ideas and
scientific news, which was managed for over 20 years by Max's wife, Gisela. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Max continued his own lifetime study of haemoglobin, "the
molecular lung", and showed how concerted structural changes follow from its
absorption of oxygen, causing it to be either fully oxygenated or fully
reduced, and making it an ideal oxygen transporter. This demonstrated a
general principle, since many enzymes and other proteins exploit a similar
"allosteric" structural change to switch a process on or off. By collecting
abnormal haemoglobins discovered throughout the world, he opened up
"molecular pathology", relating a structural abnormality to disease. Long
before mutant proteins could be created in the laboratory, he had a large
collection of single-site mutants of haemoglobin.
</p>
<p>
The Medical Research Council had an inflexible rule that when a Director of
one of its institutions reached the retirement age, he must not continue to
work in the same laboratory. Adroitly, Max announced that he had never been
the Director, only a Chairman, and after retirement he would continue to
pursue his research as usual. This arrangement, warmly welcomed by the
staff, allowed him to continue as he pleased. In retirement he wrote a lot,
including book reviews on a wide range of topics from Karl Popper's view of
Darwinism, and Fritz Haber's fanatical obsession with poison gases, to the
social revolution caused by Carl Djerassi's synthesis of a contraceptive
steroid, as well as several books of his own. He continued to travel, to
collaborate with scientists from many nations. Above all, he pursued the
endless ramifications of his deep understanding of haemoglobin and the many
human diseases linked to it. He helped to design a useful drug to deliver
oxygen to tumours and to damaged tissues. 
</p>
<p>
In his scientific autobiography <em>Science is Not a Quiet Life</em>
 Max Perutz
describes a number of scientific controversies surrounding his work, and how
they were resolved. One of these involved a mutant haemoglobin, analysed
incorrectly by its Japanese discoverers, suggesting a total conflict with
his results. Max and his collaborators identified the mistake:
</p>
<p><em>
"I worried that if our Japanese colleagues learned of this disproof of their
findings, a poor student who blamed himself for their mistake might commit
suicide. To avoid such a tragedy, I invited them to publish a joint paper, a
gesture which earned me their lifelong friendship." <br>
(Perutz, 1997)</em>
</p>
<p>
Max Perutz was a deeply humane man, loved and admired by his colleagues, who
combined that gift with exceptional powers of analysis, planning and
leadership. His domed forehead suggested a mighty brain, but his small
fingers were neat and dextrous. A robust and confident mountaineer, he
studied glacier flow early in his career, so as to work in the Alps. A back
injury in middle life ended his skiing, but he retained his love of
mountains. While his achievements were crowned with many honours, they rode
lightly on his shoulders. He refused any honour that would give him a title,
and was known, and invariably addressed by colleagues, as "Max". He lived a
quiet and unostentatious life, walking from his home to the laboratory
almost daily until a few months before his death. His brain remained
razor-sharp, he gave thrilling lectures, and his research continued. Within
the last year he had made important contributions to the understanding of
Huntington's disease, based on ideas of crystal nucleation.
</p>
<p>
He and his wife, Gisela, who survives him, were devoted to each other and to
their two children, Robin and Vivien.

<p align=left>
Charles Taylor, who was a founder member of the British Crystallography
Association, died in Salisbury Hospital on 6th March 2002. A devoted family
man, he is survived by his wife Nancy, a daughter, and two sons as well as
numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren.
</p>
<p>

Charles was best known in crystallographic circles for his pioneering work
with Henry Lipson on the development of optical diffraction analogue
(Optical Transform) methods, first suggested by Sir Lawrence Bragg in 1938.
Long before the days of digital computers these methods promised to provide
a much quicker alternative to the slow (even with Beevers-Lipson strips)
standard procedure of calculating structure factors for trial crystal
structures. This work with Lipson was carried out at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) in the years 1948
-1965, first while completing a PhD but subsequently as a Lecturer and later
still as a Reader.  He obtained his D.Sc. in 1960 for his outstanding work
there. During this period he continued to develop the theory and
instrumentation for optical analogue methods, including optically prepared
Fourier Syntheses, to the point where he was the acknowledged expert in the
field. Amongst his achievements were many elegant ways of elucidating the
structure of fibres using the optical analogue technique.
</p>
<p>

During the latter part of this period, however, electronic computers were
beginning to make the optical methods redundant for single crystal structure
determinations although they continued to be of use for disordered
structures and poorly crystalline materials such as polymers. He began at
this time, however, to develop other interests, notably in musical acoustics
and the perception of sound ó subjects for which an understanding of Fourier
transforms was equally important ó and gained a reputation as an
inspirational teacher.
</p>
<p>
In 1965 he moved to South Wales to take up the Chair of Physics at
University College Cardiff, together with the Directorship of the Viriamu
Jones Laboratory. In this appointment he succeeded another famous
crystallographer, A.J.C.Wilson, and the main research interest of the
department was also X-ray crystallography. In 1980 he masterminded for the
IUCr Commission on Teaching a series of pamphlets designed to îhelp students
with no previous knowledge of X-ray diffraction to understand the general
principles and to give some idea of what it can doï. He himself wrote the
first of these entitled îA Non-Mathematical Introduction to X-ray
Crystallographyï. It was during his tenure in Cardiff that I joined
Charlesës group as a young post- doc. The advent of lasers and the first
computer-controlled film- writing devices gave a further boost to the
Optical Transform methodology and with funding from Unesco we produced with
George Harburn the book entitled îAn Atlas of Optical Transformsï. 
</p>
<p>
While in Cardiff his interest in acoustics and music (he was an accomplished
pianist and organist) led him to establish a small research group concerned
with the perception of sound. This lead to a collaboration with the Catgut
Society of America (which pioneered a new, rational sequence of instruments
for the violin family) and thence to the establishment of a system with
which the vibrational modes of violins and guitars could be studied by
holographic interferometry. He also established a degree course in îPhysics
and Musicï that, during a period of rapid expansion of the Hi-Fi industry in
Britain, was timely indeed.
</p>
<p>
While still at Cardiff Charles was appointed in 1977 as Visiting Professor
of Experimental Physics at the Royal Institution and held this position
until 1990. He was a great believer in the value of lecture demonstrations
and built himself a considerable reputation for this genre, most notably on
the topic of physics and music but also on others such as diffraction, image
formation and colour. He became very concerned that science, and physics in
particular, was perceived by children as a difficult, uninteresting subject
and devoted much effort to arousing interest and encouraging a spirit of
enquiry in children right down to those as young as 7 or 8. îPhysics and
musicï was the subject for the first (of two) series of televised Christmas
Lectures for Children that he was invited to give at the Royal Institution.
Overall he gave some 150 lectures to schoolchildren at the RI as well as
presenting 8 Friday Evening discourses there. In addition he undertook a
number of lecture tours both in the UK and abroad. The Institute of Physics
awarded him its Bragg medal for his contribution to Physics Education.
</p>
<p>
It was on one of his many lecture tours, when he visited Australia in the
late 1980ës, that I last saw Charles. My most vivid, fond and lasting memory
of him is with flowing grey hair crouched in concentration over a
carpenterës saw (bent into an êSë-shape) and convincingly extracting a
melody from it using a violin bow. He was an inspiration to me and I am sure
to many other young prospective scientists and he will be sadly missed.

The following obituary was published in 'The Times' of April 3rd 2002.<br><br>
<h3> Charles Taylor</h3>
<p>
 Scientist who inspired and entranced generations of students with his
demonstrations of sound, colour and music
</p>
<p> 
Charles Taylor was a first-rate scientist who could communicate effectively
to a broad audience, and did so most notably in demonstration lectures. One
of his best books, The Arts and Science of Lecture Demonstration (1988),
explained how he did it. On the cover was James Gillray‚Äôs famous
caricature showing a demonstration of some of the unfortunate physiological
properties of laughing gas (discovered by Humphry Davy) in the lecture
theatre of the Royal Institution shortly after its founding in 1799. 
</p>
<p> 
The Royal Institution has always been the home of the demonstration lecture
and it became Taylor's natural home. He was appointed Royal Institution
Professor of Experimental Physics in 1977, at the same time as Anthony
Hewish and Peter Medawar became professors, and held his chair until 1988.
</p>
<p> 
In the celebrated lecture theatre where Michael Faraday had performed,
Taylor inspired and entranced generations of children with his lectures on
the topics of sound, colour and - perhaps his favourite - "physics and
music". Most memorable were his musical instruments made from wine glasses
or blocks of plywood, with which he would illustrate the physics of sound.
His young audiences always left buzzing with excitement.
 </p>
<p> 
His contributions to the Royal Institution's programmes was prodigious. He
was an indefatigable and hugely popular schools' lecturer. In 1971 he gave
his first series of televised Christmas lectures, and in 1989 he became only
the third person since 1945 to have delivered a second series of Christmas
lectures, with a demonstration called "Exploring Music".
</p>
<p> 
The following year, he and the then director of the Royal Institution, Sir
John Meurig Thomas, made the first Royal Institution Christmas lecture tour
of Japan, lecturing to thousands of children in the Science Centre in Tokyo.
This programme has since been followed by all subsequent Christmas
lecturers.

Taylor's skills as a demonstration lecturer were also ideally suited to the
format of the Institution's Friday Evening Discourses, the theatre of
science founded by Faraday in 1826. The first of Taylor's nine discourses
was given in 1969, and in 2000 he summed up his experience of "Presenting
Science to Young Children" - a fitting swansong.

Charles Alfred Taylor was born in Hull and went to school there before going
up to Queen Mary College, London, in 1940 to read physics. From there he was
shortly evacuated to Cambridge. After graduation he joined the scientific
war effort and worked on radio countermeasures for the Admiralty, first at
the signals establishment at Haslemere, and later at the US Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington and the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard.

Back in England in 1946, he worked for a while for Metropolitan-Vicars
Electrical in Manchester, doing high vacuum research. He then took a
doctorate at Manchester University, studying the relationship between
optical and X-ray diffraction. Appointed to the faculty, he was joint author
in 1958 of the influential Fourier Transforms and X-ray Diffraction.
</p>

In 1965 he moved to Cardiff as Professor of Physics at University College,
where he remained for the rest of his career. Although his research
concentrated on X-ray diffraction (he jointly produced the Unesco Atlas of
Optical Transformations in 1975, for instance), his work in acoustics
(sometimes seen as the poor relation of physics) was highly influential, not
only in his lecturing, but also in improving the acoustics of the Sherman
Theatre in Cardiff. For the first half of the 1970s he was a vice-president
of the Institute of Physics, which awarded him the Bragg Medal in 1983.
Three years later he was the first recipient of the newly established
Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, given for excellence in science
communication.

Taylor married Nancy Truefitt in 1944 and they had two sons and a daughter.
For the past 20 years or so they lived in Warminster, where he cared for his
wife who developed acute rheumatoid arthritis. Though an unassuming man, he
brought to the work of caring for her the blend of natural charm, profound
insight and huge enthusiasm that also made him the perfect expositor of the
wonder and excitement of scientific knowledge.

He is survived by his wife and children.

Charles Taylor was also active in the International Union of Crystallography,
he was Chairman of the Teaching Commission when he instigated their series of
'Teaching Pamphlets' for students. These were initially available as A5 sized
paper booklets. They are now freely available on the IUCr Website.</p>
<p>
He was a fascinating talker; at a BCA Annual meeting, 
in I think 1984, at Nottingham,
he regaled Lesley Dent Glasser and I with tales of undergraduate life in
Cambridge during the Second World War. The only undergraduates allowed to
study  at that time were those whose subjects, such as physics, were thought
to be essential to the War effort. Prospective Arts students were expected
to  delay their studies and contribute to the War Effort in some more
immediate way. However, there were still some Music tutors left in the
University, who starved of their teaching of Music undergraduates,
were happy to help science students with an amateur
interest in music. This meant that Charles Taylor received excellent
music tuition in Kings College Chapel from fine musicians; he described it 
as a fantastic experience he would probably not have had in more normal
times.
