Dr Ron Jenkins, born 10th April 1932 died peacefully at his home in
Downingtown Pennsylvania on 19th June 2002. He was one of the great
pioneers, teachers and leaders in the field of X-ray analysis, well known
and  highly respected in materials science circles  around  the  world.  A
devout Christian and devoted family man, he is survived by his wife of 47
years, Phyllis, five children and five grandchildren. 
</p>
<p>
Ron  was  born  in  Oxford  and awarded a scholarship to the City of Oxford
High School. He studied Physics and Metallurgy at the University of London,
Chemistry at the Oxford Polytechnic Institute (ONC, HNC, LRSC) and was 
awarded  his  Ph.D.  (Chem. Phys.) at the Polytechnic Institute of New York.
</p>
<p>
Ron started his career as an Analytical Chemist at Esso Research in Abingdon
in 1953. At this time he served two years national service as a
meteorologist in the RAF. In 1962 he became manager of the X-ray
applications Laboratory for Philips Research and Control Instruments in
London. In 1967 he moved to Philips in Eindhoven to head the X-ray
Applications Laboratory and in 1971 to Philips Electronic Instruments in
Mahwah New Jersey as Principal Scientist. He took up the post of Principal
Scientist with ICDD in 1986 becoming Executive Director in 1996 and serving
as Corporate Secretary and member of the Board of Directors. His ceaseless
efforts saw the introduction of CD-Rom Technology, the growth of membership
and massive expansion of the PDF file.
</p>
<p>
The X-ray community has lost one of its leaders, but Ron‘s legacy of
teaching X-ray science will live on. It is estimated that 5000 students
attended his workshops around the world. Many will fondly remember his BCA
workshops in Leeds, Cardiff, UMIST and Daresbury, especially those fortunate
to receive one of his textbooks and have it personally signed. He wrote 10
textbooks and contributed 11 book chapters on x-ray methods, presented over
200 scientific papers on the subject and prepared two audiovisual courses
for the American Chemical Society.
</p>
<p>
His technical achievements were recognised by the scientific community, and
he received many awards and honours including: Gold Medallist, Society for
Applied Spectroscopy 1982; Birks Award in X-ray Spectrometry 1986; Barrett
Award in X-ray Diffraction 1993; Jenkins Award for Lifetime achievements in
X-ray Analysis 2002. He is the only person to receive both the Birks and
Barrett awards. Ron‘s ability to tell a good story was suitably rewarded by
his easily winning a light hearted after- dinner competition at the 1998
Denver Conference. The Denver Conference owes much to Ron for his unstinting
and dedicated work as chairman of its organising committee since 1981. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to his technical achievements, Dr. Jenkins was a member of STURP
(Shroud of Turin Research Project) and lectured over 50 times to about 6000
people regarding the artefact. His book "Closing the Gap between Science and
Religion" outlines his dedication to the Christian faith. He was most
recently a member of the Church of the Nazarene, where he served as Council
member, Choir Director, Vocal Soloist and Sunday School teacher. He was also
a trustee of the Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy, Massachusetts, for many
years. His love of music was expressed as a vocal soloist and by playing the
trombone in a local brass ensemble. Denver Conference attendees will
doubtless remember his participation in post-banquet entertainment, as a
member of the "Powdermen" Barbershop Quartet!

<p>
Ron was a compassionate man with a charismatic sense of humour who brought
leadership and enthusiasm to all aspects of his life. A Celebration of Life
Service was held at the West Chester Church of the Nazarene, Pennsylvania on
the 22 June. He will be lovingly remembered by many people around the world
who were touched by his life.
