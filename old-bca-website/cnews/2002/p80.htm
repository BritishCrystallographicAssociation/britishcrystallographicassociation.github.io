<strong>Max Perutz 1914 - 2002</strong>
</center>
<p>
<em>
The following note is based on
that written by Richard Henderson on the day Max died.
<br>
A full obituary will be published
in the June issue of
Crystallography News.
</em></p>
<p>
Max Perutz died early in the
morning of February 6th from
cancer which developed during
the last few months.
Max was the Chairman of the
MRC Laboratory at Cambridge
from its opening in 1962 in the
present building until 1979 when
he continued as a "retired
worker", publishing over 100
papers and articles during his
retirement.  Until the Friday
before Christmas he was active in
the lab almost every day,
submitting his last paper just a
few days before then.  This
paper, on the structure of the
glutamine repeats in
Huntington's Disease, is now in
press in PNAS.
</p>
<p>
Max will be remembered for his
pioneering work in protein
crystallography using X-ray
diffraction, which led to the
determination of the atomic
structures of oxy and deoxy
haemoglobin and the growth of
the flourishing field of
macromolecular crystallography.
He was a gifted writer and
lecturer who wrote many essays,
books and book reviews.  He had
a special talent for attracting and
supporting other outstanding
scientists whose work laid the
foundations of Molecular
Biology, first in the MRC Unit for
Molecular Biology in the
Cavendish and, later, on the Hills
Road site in the MRC Laboratory
of Molecular Biology.  He took
particular pleasure in talking
with students and other young
scientists about their work.
</p>
<p>
We shall miss him and long
remember the splendid example
he has set for us all.

Richard Walker
</center>
<p>
On 13 November  2001  the  CLRC Press  release  announced  the appointment 
of  the  Technical Director  for  Diamond,  the synchrotron  due  to  be 
built  at  the CLRC  Rutherford  Appleton Laboratory. He is Dr Richard
Walker,  who  started  his  new  job  on 7  January  2002.  The  appointment
has  been  made  jointly  by  the  OST, the  Wellcome  Trust  and  the 
French Government. Dr Walker has been at Sincrotron Trieste in Italy since
1988  where  he  was  Director  of  the Light  Sources  Division.  Prior  to 
his employment in Italy Dr Walker spent 13 years in the Accelerator Physics
Section at Daresbury Laboratory  in  Warrington,  location of  the  UK's 
Synchrotron  Radiation Source  (SRS).

<h3>B.T.M. Willis  Prize 
awarded  to  Chick  Wilson</h3>  

Congratulations to Chick
Wilson; he has been awarded the first BTM Willis Prize, given by the Neutron
Scattering Group of the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of
Chemistry, for outstanding contributions to neutron scattering science.  He
delivered his prize lecture, entitled 'Beyond the Thermal Ellipsoid in
Molecular Crystal Structures', at the Neutron and Muon Users Meeting
recently in Grenoble at the ILL. 
</p> 
<p>
The Willis Prize and Lectureship is now 
an  annual  award  in  honour of Terry Willis, a founding father of the
neutron scattering group. It is expected that normally the recipient of the
lectureship will be under 40 years old and employed at a British University,
Institution or Research Facility (including the Institut Laue Langevin,
Grenoble). A detailed nomination must be made to the Chairman of the Neutron
Scattering Group and must be accompanied by three letters of support from
appropriate authorities in the field, of which at least two must be from
outside the nominee's institution. For further information, see
