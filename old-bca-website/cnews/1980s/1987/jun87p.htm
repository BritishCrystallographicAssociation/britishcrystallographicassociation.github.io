The first ever Ewald Prize of the International Union of Applied
Crystallography has been awarded jointly to Professor J. M. COWLEY and Dr.
A.F. MOODIE for their outstanding achievements in electron diffraction and
microscopy,      especially for     their fundamental contributions to the
theory and technique of direct imaging of crystal structures and structure
defects by high resolution electron microscopy.       Full details of their
citation and of the prize itself are given on

THE "WOLF FOUNDATION" PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY FOR 1987
</center>
</p><p>
The 1987 Wolf Prize in Chemistry will be awarded to two British scientists,
pioneers in the study of enzyme structure and function by means of X-ray
crystallography - Professor Sir David C. Phillips (of Oxford University) and
Professor David M. Blow (of London University Imperial College).
</p><p>
Their use of improved methods of X-ray crystallography led to the determination of the exact three-dimensional structure of enzymes - the catalysts of
life processes that regulate all the biological activities in the living
organism. The first animal enzyme structure to be solved by Phillips in 1965
was Lysozyme. Solving also the structure of the complex formed by the enzyme 
and its substrate (the molecule activated by it), he was led to suggest the
"lock-and-key" mechanism in which the interaction between enzyme and
substrate depends on the actual shape of the molecules.
</p><p>
Blow, who determined the structure of the much larger enzyme chymotrypsin in
1967, also conducted a comparative study of the activity of different
enzymes, providing a first-hand demonstration of the stereo-chemical
(shape-dependent) origin of their specific activities.
</p><p>
Following later advances, Blow and his collaborators conducted in 1981 the
first experiments in protein engineering, changing the activity of enzymes
by selectively changing some of its amino-acid building blocks.
</p><p>
These achievements followed major improvements in the methods of X-ray
crystallography. Phillips (together with Arndt) improved the accuracy of
crystallographic measurements by introducing automation, while Blow
(together with Rossmann) succeeded in overcoming the problem of phase
determination, one of the major obstacles in the interpretation of the X-ray
data, Without these improvements, the accurate determination of structures
of such complex systems as enzymes would have been utterly impossible, These
structure determinations, and the resulting insight into the mechanism of
enzyme activity that followed, formed a major step in the process of
transforming the mysteries of life into the language of physical chemistry

Dear Colleagues,<br><br>

It give me great pleasure to announce that the First Ewald Prize for
outstanding contributions to the science of crystallography has been awarded
jointly to<br><br>
<center><B>
Professor J.M. Cowley and Dr A.F. Moodie<br><br>
</B></center>
for their outstanding achievements in electron diffraction and microscopy,
especially for their fundamental contributions to the theory and technique
of direct imaging of crystal structures and structure defects by high
resolution electron microscopy.<br><br>
</p><p>
Their pioneering work on the dynamical scattering of electrons was reported
in a series of papers in <I>Acta Crystallographica</i>
 and other journals from 1957
onwards. A theory of Fourier images led them to the multi-slice formulation
of the scattering of an electron wave in its passage through a crystal. This
formulation is able to take into account many hundreds of scattered beams,
and has become the basis of widely-used computer programs. The theory allows
the electron micrographs, obtained with modern high resolution instruments,
to be reliably and quantitatively interpreted, and used for the
determination of the structures of both perfect crystals and crystals
containing defects. Professor Cowley and Dr Moodie, together and separately,
have made many further contributions to theory, methods and results in
electron diffraction and microscopy. Their work has often stressed a unified
approach to diffraction and microscopy through physical optics. An overview
of the whole field may be Found in Professor Cowley's book <I>"Diffraction
Physics"</I> (1981).
</p><p>
John Maxwell Cowley, born in Australia in 1923 and a graduate of Adelaide
University, was formerly a Chief Research Scientist at the Division of
Chemical Physics, CSIRD, Melbourne, Australia. Later he was Professor of
Physics at the University of Melbourne, and since 1970 has been the Galvin
Professor of Physics at Arizona State University, Tempe, USA.
</p><p>
Alexander Forbes Moodie, born in Scotland in 1923, graduated from St.
Andrews University in 1948. Since then he has been a member of CSIRO in
Australia where he is a Chief Research Scientist at the Division of Chemical
Physics. This Division was incorporated into the Division of Materials
Science and Technolcgy at the end of 1986.
</p><p>
The presentation of the Ewald Prize will take place at the Opening Ceremony
of the XIV International Congress of Crystallography at Perth, Western
Australia, on 12 August 1987.

Please give the announcement of this award as wide publicity as possible by
whatever means you have at your disposal. A copy of the original
announcement of the Prize is enclosed, for information.

INFORMATION AND COMMENTS<br>
<br>

EDITORIAL<br>

It is a privilege to have been asked by the BCA to edit "Crystallography
News", and I am very much indebted to Moreton Moore, who has carried out
this job so well for so many years, not only for creating a system which
runs smoothly and well, but also for helping me to take over his mantle in a
relatively painless way.      One of the things I would like to do as Editor
is to continue to improve the layout and content of the News, as Moreton has
done over the years, so that it really does provide a useful service to
Members and so that it genuinely reflects their interests. I hope that you
will all feel free to make suggestions to me  on how to make your newsletter
even more substantial and readable.   
     In particular I would welcome more direct scientific comment, 
news and letters on topics of interest so that the News becomes a 
genuine forum for comment on crystallographic activities Worldwide.

STANDARD CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC FILE STRUCTURE - 87<br><br><br>
How often have you been frustrated by finding that your datafile was in the wrong format far your program? And how much time have you spent in writing conversion programs to change data from one format to another?
</p><p>
In order to minimise these problems, the Data  and Computing Commissions of    
the International     Union of Crystallography approved, in 1981, a Standard
Crystallagraphic File Structure (Acta Cryst A39 216-224).     This describes
a file structure that can be used to store or transfer most kinds af
crystallographic data and, at the same time, is easy to program and is
adaptable to individual users needs. Since 1981 the standard has been
enhanced and in the mast recent release (SCFS-87) it can include all the
information (including text, tables and supplementary material) required for
a short structural paper in Acta Crystallagraphica including the text.      
It is not only designed far giving structural data, it can also include data
as different as powder patterns and protein derivative structure factors.
