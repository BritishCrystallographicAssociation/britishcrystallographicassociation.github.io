1.     <u>JOINT PUBLICATION</u>
        This is the first newsletter to be published for the 
Crystallography Groups of both the Institute of Physics and

June, October and December.      Items for inclusion in the 
Newsletter are welcome, preferably typed with single line 
spacing on A4 paper ready for off-set litho reproduction. 
Copy dates are the 2Oth day of the month preceding publication. 
Please send items either to Dr Moreton Moore, Department of 
Physics, Royal Holloway College, Egham, Surrey, TW20 OEX, 
or to Dr Stephen Wallwork, Department of Chemistry, University 
of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD

<a name="progress">2.</a>     <u>Further Progress Towards the Formation of a British Crystallographic 
Association</u>

        A joint meeting of the committees of the IOP Crystallography 
Group and the Chemical Crystallography Group was held on 
November 17 1980 to consider the proposals to form a BCA. 
The principle of forming such a body was warmly accepted 
and a small group of five was set up to work on the proposals 
in detail and to draw up Statutes and Bye-laws. A number 
of principles were agreed on to guide this group in its
task. This Working Party, having met on 19 December 1980 
and 26 January 1981, and having consulted extensively by 
correspondence, recently produced draft Statutes and Bye-laws 
for consideration by the committees of the two crystallography 
groups.

        The committee of the Chemical Crystallography Group 
discussed these documents and their implications at its meeting on
4 March and the committee of the IOP Crystallography Group 
will likewise consider these documents at its meeting on 
April 14. The two Group committees will pass on their 
suggestions for modifications of the Statutes and Bye-laws 
and will also seek the approval of their respective parent 
bodies (the RSC and the IOP). If the two committees and 
their parent bodies agree to the proposals in general and 
to a particular form of words for the governing documents 
in particular, the full proposals will be circulated to the 
members of the two Groups for approval during the summer 
of 1981. If approval is obtained, the Working Party will 
proceed to the establishment of the BCA.

If all this programme can be completed in time, and 
if agreement of all the bodies concerned has been secured,
it is hoped to have an inaugural meeting of the BCA, with
invited papers from a number of leading crystallographers 
and attended by as many members as possible of both Crystallography
Groups, at the University of Durham, from 5 to 7 April 1982. 
(Reserve the dates in your diary now!) Provisional plans 
have already been made by the University of Durham to hold
a crystallography conference at this time and it is hoped
to broaden the scope of this meeting if the proposals for 
the formation of the BCA are approved. It would then take 
the place of the Spring Meeting for each Group.

1. <u>Important Letter to Group Members concerning the Formation of the British 
Crystallographic Association</u>
	Readers of recent issues of the Newsletter will already be aware of the 
various articles, and the discussions that have taken place, concerning the 
proposals for the formation of a British Crystallographic Association. Favourable 
responses to these proposals were voiced at the conferences held at St.Andrews 
(Easter, 1980) and Glasgow (September, 1980). A joint meeting of the committees
of the IOP Crystallography Group and the Chemical Crystallography Group in 
November 1980 set up a Working Party to consider the proposals in detail and to
draw up Statutes and By-laws. Draft versions of these have been fully discussed
by the committees of the two Groups, who are satisfied that they will put into
effect the intentions that have already been discussed within the Groups, and 
which are outlined below. The parent bodies of the two Groups (the IOP and the 
RSC) see no difficulty, in principle, with the proposals but, before official 
agreement of their Councils is sought, an expression of acceptance by the members
of the groups is needed.

	The aim in formulating the proposals has been to create a basis for an 
independent British Crystallographic Association, able to cater for all aspects
of crystallography, including applied crystallography and biological structure,
which will incorporate the two established crystallographic groups of the 
Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Chemistry, without disturbing 
their activities in any way, These Groups already cater for physical and 
chemical aspects of crystallography, and their memberships include the majority
of, but not all, professional crystallographers in the country.


	The members of these two Groups will automatically become members of the 
BCA (Joint Members), with full membership rights, without paying any additional
subscription. It will be possible for others to become Ordinary Members of the
BCA by paying a subscription (probably of £8 to £lO per year) directly to the
BCA. These people will also be able to join one Group for no additional fee. 
All BCA members (Ordinary <u>and</u> Joint Members) will be able to join further 
Groups (including new Groups which may be formed in the future) for a small 
additional fee.


	By becoming members of the BCA, present Group members, without loss of any 
of their current rights and privileges, will gain the advantages of belonging 
to a specifically crystallographic body with a broad interdisciplinary membership.
This body will be able to speak and act on behalf of crystallography as a whole 
at the national level and it is hoped that it will develop the same authority,
within the British Isles, as the American Crystallographic Association enjoys
across the Atlantic. The standing of members as crystallographers will be 
increased in that they will be part of, and able to influence, a more powerful
crystallographic body than the present organisations can ever become. The status
of crystallography within the British Isles will consequently also be enhanced.

	The most difficult problem has been to devise a way to make the BCA

     However, it is essential to raise a significant capital sum at the outset. 
This is needed particularly to provide an adequate operating basis for BCA 
activities, and to cushion the organisation against the occasional loss on a meeting. We think that very many crystallographers will recognise the value of 
the new organisation, both for enhancing contacts between crystallographers, and
in allowing them to be represented centrally in matters which affect their interests. 

We shall be inviting established crystallographers, whether or not they are members of the present crystallography groups, to become Founder Members of the BCA for the payment of £lOO. As Founder Members, they will automatically be BCA members for 
10 years without further payment. We consider it desirable to raise at least 
£lO,000 by this means. The Founder membership scheme is intended as a means of 
supporting the BCA through its difficult early years, <u>not</u> as a money-saving option.

     The Groups of the IOP and RSC are financed at present by payments made through
their parent bodies. An equivalent payment will be made by the BCA to Group funds 
for those Group members who are not members of the IOP or the RSC. Thus the 
financing of the Groups will remain exactly as before, and it will make no difference to the Group which of the three parent bodies a member belongs to.

     The draft constitution which has been drawn up will need to be professionally 
checked by experts before application is made for the BCA to have the status 
of an educational charity - essential to avoid income tax liability.Once charitable status is obtained, Founder Memberships and Sponsorships will be solicited, and 
assuming that adequate support is obtained, the BCA will come into active existence at the Durham Crystallography Meeting, 5-7 April 1982, which will in any case, form a joint Spring Meeting of the IOP and RSC Crystallography Groups.

The formation of the BCA is an important matter for the future of the Groups 
and, indeed, for the future of crystallography in the British Isles. The committees of both groups are unanimous in strongly recommending acceptance of the proposals. 
They now wish to receive a firm indication of group members' opinions, which will 
form part of their recommendation to the IOP and the RSC. We therefore urge you 
to complete and return the reply slip below.
