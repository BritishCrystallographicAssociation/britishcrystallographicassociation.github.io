<h3>The Kathleen Lonsdale Lectures</h3>
At the last Council meeting it was resolved that the BCA should inaugurate a
series of annual lectures to commemmorate the work of the late Dame Kathleen
Lonsdale.  The British Association for the Advancement of Science has agreed
that the lectures should be given during the BA Annual meeting. They will be
public lectures and BCA members will be free to attend. The first Kathleen
Lonsdale Lecture will be in Belfast in August 1987. Council has invited its
President Professor D.M.Blow F.R.S., to be the lecturer. Further details
will be given later.

<strong>From the BCA Secretary</strong><br>
The Annual Meetng of the British Association was held this year in Belfast.
The first Londsdale Lecture was given by our President Professor David Blow
on Augsut 27. His lecture on <em>'Enzyme Engineering'</em> was extremely
well received and we extend our congratulations to him as the opening
Lonsdale lecturer and for raising the enthusiasm of the public for our
subject.</p>
<p>
The Lonsdale lecturer next year will be Professor Michael Hart who will present his lecture at the British Association meeting in Oxford. Further details will be announced in subsequent newsletter.

The second school in in the planning stages and is expected to take place at
Aston University immediately following the BCA meeting in Oxford, April
1989. Further details will be given in the next newsletter. Any Commercial
