Moreton Moore has kindly delved into his archives and found some notes on
origin of the Lonsdale Lecture and a paper written by Gordon Cox in 1985 on
the history of the Bragg Lectures. The notes printed before each lecture are
based on these papers.<br>

There are three named lectures listed here:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="#bragg">Bragg </a>lectures
  <li><a href="#dmch">Dorothy Hodgkin</a> lectures
  <li><a href="#kl">Kathleen Lonsdale</a> lectures

<P>
Following a meeting of the National Committee of Crystallography in November
1957, Gordon Cox discussed the idea of a memorial Bragg lecture with fellow
committee members Kathleen Lonsdale and W.H.Taylor.  Since 1962 was the
centenary of the birth of W.H.Bragg and the jubilee of the discovery of
X-ray diffraction by crystals it seemed a good year to begin the lectures. 
Kathleen Lonsdale donated her prize money from the award of the Davy Medal
from the Royal Society,  others followed and a small fund was created to
provide an honorarium and travelling expenses for a lecture to be held every
two or three years. The original idea was to hold the lectures for about 20
years, but Helen Megaw argued strongly that she saw no reason to limit the
time. In 1960 the Royal Institution agreed to administer the fund in trust 
for the endowment of the Bragg lectures.  The first public announcement of
the lectures was made by Kathleen Lonsdale on 17th August 1960 following
Lawrence Bragg's Congress Discourse on "The Growth in the Power of X-ray
Analyses" at the IUCr in Cambridge. <p>

<H2><a name="dmch">The Dorothy Hodgkin </a>Lecture</H2>

This is given by the recipient of the 
<a href="../../../admin/prnom.html#dch">Dorothy Hodgkin Prize</a> which was set up
by the BCA to commemorate Dorothy's great contribution to science in general
and to crystallography in particular. It was first awarded in the year of
her 80th birthday. The prize is awarded every three years by a sub-committee
of the BCA Council.   Eligibility is not subject to any restrictions of age,
nationality, past or present places of work.

  The prize money comes from the interest on donations to the 'Dorothy
Hodgkin Prize Fund' administered by the BCA.  Further donations to the fund
are welcome at any time, please contact the BCA Treasurer for information,
or make a donation when you pay your BCA membership fee. <p> <h2>Dorothy

<H2><a name="kl">The Kathleen Lonsdale </a>Lecture</H2>

In 1985 the Bragg Lecture Fund Committee considered whether they should
organize a memorial lecture for Kathleen Lonsdale. They decided it would be
inappropriate for them to do it; instead they recommended that the British
Crystallographic Association approach the British Association for the
Advancement of Science (BAAS) about a possible annual Lonsdale Lecture, at
which young people would hear about crystallography. These were held for a
few years, but attracted a very small audience.  The BCA Council therefore
decided to move the Lonsdale lecture to take place during the BCA Annual
Meeting.
<h2>Lonsdale lectures</h2>
The September 1986 issue of 'Crystallography News' page 5 reported that the 
BCA Council had decided
to inaugurate a series of annual lectures to commemmorate the work of the late
Dame Kathleen Lonsdale.
The December 1987 issue on page 7 records that the 1st
Lonsdale lecture was given by our BCA President David Blow.
