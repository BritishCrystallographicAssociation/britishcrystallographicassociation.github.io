<p><font face="Helvetica">Since the last ISIS news article
appeared in the March issue of <em>Crystallography News</em>,
improvements have been made in several areas within the ISIS
Crystallography facilities which merit mention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">The ISIS WWW pages have been updated
and relaunched and the Crystallography group pages (whose address
is given at the end of this article) now include updated
instrument specifications, instrument scientist contact details
and on-line instrument user guides.</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">In the ISIS experimental hall, much
effort has been expended on the diffractometers during the recent
shutdown. On HRPD, a new sample position enclosure has been
constructed which provides users of the instrument with a much
more flexible working environment, especially for experiments
involving non-ambient conditions such as cryostats, furnaces or
reaction vessels. At the same time, the VAXstation 3200
instrument computer was replaced with a new Digital Alphastation
500/266 machine, which is linked to the data acquisition
electronics (DAE) via a SCSI interface. Finally, in May during
ISIS cycle&nbsp;2/97, the new NERC funded high temperature
furnace (capable of reaching 2800K) was commissioned successfully
to 1800°C using a perovskite (CaTiO<sub>3</sub>) sample
(I.G.&nbsp;Wood and G.D.&nbsp;Price, University College, London).
Importantly, these experiments showed no evidence for temperature
gradients along the 25mm length of the sample, even as the
highest tempertures were approached.</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">This high temperature furnace was also
tested on POLARIS, and although the Bragg reflections from the
tantalum furnace elements will cause more problems at
backscattering angles on this instrument than on HRPD due the
lower instrumental resolution, it is intended to construct a set
of collimators to allow data to be collected in the POLARIS 2</font><font
face="Symbol">q</font><font face="Helvetica">&nbsp;=&nbsp;90°
detector banks which will be free of scattering from the tantalum
(and vanadium) furnace element and heat shield components. This
data will have a slightly lower resolution than that collected in
the backscattering detectors, but the latter will still be
available with the collimation in place. Also during the
shutdown, the last of the old, lower efficiency, <sup>3</sup>He
gas tubes in the POLARIS backscattering detector banks were
replaced by new tubes with 10 atmospheres pressure of</font><font
size="2" face="Helvetica"> </font><font face="Helvetica"><sup>3</sup>He
gas, completing the programme of improvements made to the
diffractometer as it was moved from ISIS beamline S1 to N7 last
autumn (see <em>Crystallography News</em>, No. 60, March 1997).</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">SXD, the single crystal diffractometer,
also benefited from the current instrument computer replacement
program when it acquired a new Digital Alphastation 500/333
machine, also linked to the DAE via a SCSI interface. This has
two important benefits for the SXD user programme. Firstly it
will allow much faster on-line data reduction and processing
during experiments. More importantly, however, is the significant
reduction in time between data collection runs, where the time
taken to end one run, write the very large data set to disk,
initialise the DAE and start the next run has been dramatically
reduced from a mind-numbing ¼&nbsp;hour to under two minutes - a
significant benefit when many data collection runs (frames) only
last for 20-30 minutes or so!</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">The 1997 ISIS Annual Report, 
<em><a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/annualreport/">ISIS'97</a></em>, 
is in the final stages of preparation and will be
published in the next few weeks. The Report contains all the
latest information on the current state of the ISIS instrument
suite as well as reports on experiments carried out at ISIS over
the previous 12 months. Among the highlights to be featured this
year are powder diffraction studies of 
<em><a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/annualreport/feature1.htm">
negative thermal expansion materials</a></em> and of 
<em><a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/annualreport/feature2.htm">
magnetoresistive manganese oxide perovskites</a></em>, 
<em><<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/annualreport/feature3.htm">
variable temperature
single crystal studies of organic materials</a></em>, and the use
of new 
<em><a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/annualreport/feature17.htm">
genetic algorithm techniques</a></em> in crystal
structure solution. The report is automatically sent to all
principal investigators listed in the ISIS database, but anyone
wishing to receive a copy should contact the ISIS University
Liaison office on 01235 445592, e-mail:&nbsp;ULS@isise.rl.ac.uk.
The full report will also be available on the WWW as it is
published.</font></p>

<p><font face="Helvetica">Finally, a reminder: ISIS beamtime
application deadlines are 16 April and 16 October each year.
Details on how to apply are available on the WWW at </font><a
