<h1> Neutrons and X-rays - Complementary Techniques for
 Structural and Dynamic Disorder</h1>
<h2>8 - 9 May 1997</h2>
<p>
A meeting organised by the Neutron Scattering Group of the
Institute of Physics to celebrate the 70th birthday of B.T.M.Willis,
(Terry to his friends).

<p>
A celebration dinner was held at the Cosener's House on 8 May where after
dinner speakers reminisced about their work with Terry. The atmosphere was
very jovial with after dinner speeches from Gerry Lander, Judith Howard, and
Stuart Pawley.
<p>
Next morning <strong>Colin Carlile</strong> welcomed delegates with a 
few words about 'the
birthday boy' and disclosed that there were two more in the audience, John
Reid and Bill David, but declined to lead the audience in singing 'Happy
Birthday' to all of them. Photo shows left to right, John, Terry, Bill.<br>

<p>
The first speaker, <strong>Gerry Lander</strong>, from Karlsruhe, spoke on 
<em>'Magnetism in
Uranium Dioxide'</em>. Gerry first met Terry at one of the early summer schools,
and later worked with him on the properties of uranium dioxide. He reminded
us that the first measurements of its susceptibility were made in 1930; in
1957 Henshaw and Brockhouse scattered neutrons from the powder, but the magnetic
structure was not found until 1965, when two groups, Willis and Taylor at
Harwell, and Fraser et al. from Brookhaven published it within two weeks of
each other, Terry being first past the post!. Cowley and Dolling worked on
magnetic excitations in the mid 1960s; the 1970s saw Japanese workers
understanding the Jahn-Teller effect, and in 1988 Amoretti et al. made a
complete measurement of the hyperfine splitting in the crystal field. Such
measurements could not be done at a reactor, and had to wait until a
powerful enough pulsed neutron source was built. Measurements were made at
IPNS in 1983, but had poor statistics; better results were obtained from HET
at ISIS by Osborne et al. in 1988 who lowered the temperature to 6.5 K and
found a hyperfine splitting of the peaks.
<p>
Synchrotron X-rays have been used to look at the phase transition in UO2.
Lander was interested in the surface magnetism and used grazing incidence
specular reflection at angles between 0.5 and 2 degrees on highly polished
flat single crystals, on the [100] face. He found that most of the magnetism
was confined to a very thin layer at the surface. 
<p>
Christiane Muggelberg, who was also present, has recently succeeded in
imaging the [111] face using the Scanning Tunnelling Electron Microscope at
the Department of Materials, Oxford at elevated temperatures and has shown
that the oxygen sits in the interstitial sites. The [110] face appears to
have a dimer construction with some missing rows of atoms. She has also made
the first STM pictures of  the mobility of the oxygen atoms on the surface.
This opens up the possibility of watching catalytic reactions on a surface.
<p>
<strong>Alberto Albinati</strong>, Milan, first met Terry in Scandinavia and then at the 1972 summer school, following which they
worked on neutron diffraction using PANDA, an early instrument at Harwell.
They used neutron powder diffraction to investigate the temperature
dependence of thermal parameters of UO2 and published a review in the
Journal of Applied Crystallography in 1982 on <em>"The Rietveld method in Powder
Diffraction"</em>. Alberto also described work on the catalytic cycle for the
hydrogenation of ethylene in an attempt to find out how to encourage the
breaking of the H-H bond.
<p>
<strong>Judith Howard</strong>, from Durham. was the next speaker. She came to Oxford as 
Judith Duckworth, a graduate student planning to work with Dorothy Hodgkin
on the structure of insulin, but it proved difficult to grow large enough
crystals, and instead she began to work with Terry as her Harwell supervisor
on the structure and lattice dynamics of Hexamethylene Tetramine instead; 
she said she owes her whole subsequent career to Terry's early guidance. 
Judith's early work at Harwell was on PLUTO, working with the 'Mark II' 
Uli Arndt diffractometer. She found 48 independent reflections at room 
temperature, and 63 at 100° C, and built her
own mini-cooler to improve the quality of reflections; thus was born her
interest in low temperature crystallography using X-rays and neutrons which
she has been pursuing ever since. She described attempts to measure the
structure of tri ethylene nickel at D8 in the ILL, made more difficult by
the problem that the crystals had to be made by sublimation at the reactor
since they are so unstable. At Durham she is making low temperature studies
on hydrides and using neutrons elsewhere to sort out the hydrogen positions.
One problem is how to describe the unusual shaped molecules, including
pentagonal bipyramids and capped trigonal prisms. The Cambridge
Crystallographic Data base is used to look for reaction pathways in organo
metallic compounds. Now that longer wavelength X-rays are available in
Durham she is also working on magnetism.
<p>
<strong>Keith Prout</strong>, from Chemical Crystallography, Oxford, explained that he and Terry were at the same school in
Barnsley, during the 1930s but missed being there at the same time by one
year. 'Willis' was a well known name in Barnsley in those days; Keith showed
us a  slide of an old type of delivery van emblazoned with the name. He first
met Terry at  Harwell in the 1950s and Terry has been working with Keith in the
Dept of Chemical Crystallography in Oxford since moving from Harwell in
about 1985. They worked on the structure of cimetidene (trade name
Tagamet ) a hydrogen antagonist drug used to relieve stomach ulcers. The
structure was solved using X-rays and found to have 4 polymorphs.
<p>
<strong>George Bacon</strong>, Professor emeritus at Sheffield,  told us how he first met
Terry in 1952 when he was working for GEC with Rooksby who was running the
X-ray scattering Group of the Institute of Physics at that time. The IoP
Neutron Scattering Group which organised today's meeting grew out of the
older group. Ron Dyer and George organised the Physical Society Exhibition
in 1952 and that was when George introduced Terry to the uses of neutrons
and persuaded him to come to work at Harwell. The first single crystal
measurements in the UK made using neutrons were done at GLEEP in 1947. The
BEPO reactor started to operate a few years later, when they used a 'Curran'
instrument, named after John Curran of Cardiff whose main business was
accurate manufacture of radar turntables so they knew he would be able to
make them a good goniometer. They were studying the properties of graphite.
Working with neutrons was different in those days because they had no
guarantee that they could keep their instruments at the reactor face for any
significant  length of time, so all the instruments had to be mobile.
Collimators were made of wood  and timing done manually with a
stop watch. They worked on single crystals and the problem of extinction
following the work on graphite and later studied magnetic materials, before
Terry started working with Dorothy Hodgkin on the structure of Vitamin B12.
<p>
   George then discussed his work on the structure of human and animal bone. 
Bone is made partly from polycrystallites of the mineral apatite loosely
bound together with collagen. Using neutrons he finds that the apatite is
oriented differently depending on the stresses the bone experiences.  The
collagen contains a lot of hydrogen which would deflect the neutrons so it
is removed by heating to 600 degrees for about 20 minutes which leaves the
apatite structures intact. Early experiments were done at Harwell on the
BADGER instrument on rat bones, later ones at the ILL in Grenoble. These
showed  that apatite orientation in the parts of the bone where the muscles
were attached was different from that in other parts. He has also looked at
bones found in archaeological digs in the Orkneys, where people whose
remains were found at the cliff edges, who spent a lot of time climbing up
and down the cliffs to fish, had different orientations of apatitite in
their bones from those found at excavations in the central plateau where
people stayed at about the same height most of the time.  This gave us a
fascinating insight into the mechanisms of adaptive biology. Optical
measurements using circularly polarised light is being used to try to see
whether the collagen also shows a similar variation in orientation.

<p>
After lunch, <strong>Terry</strong> himself gave us a review of his work with Colin Carlile
on thermal diffuse scattering (TDS), and a method of evaluating phonon
dispersion curves without Energy Analysis for acoustic phonons close to the
origin of the Brillouin Zone. This work requires pulsed neutrons in order to
have the necessary conditions to isolate the phonon edges uniquely. Data
from Pyrolytic graphite clearly demonstrates the feasibility of the method
as one observes at angles off the Bragg scattering condition.Using the ISIS
instrument, HRPD, in back scattering mode he was able to observe phonon
dispersion curves in Barium Fluoride and Calcium Fluoride which are
acoustically isotropic and anisotropic respectively. The method is
restricted to the zone centre and it is not possible to choose the phonon
direction, but data are collected very quickly. It is an ideal method for
studying the evolution of dispersion curves as one approaches a phase
transition for example.
<p>
<strong>Stuart Pawley</strong>, Edinburgh, spoke on <em>'Molecules behaving thermally'</em>. Stuart's 
supervisor was Bill Cochran; but he did a lot of his work with Terry, who was
"always
thinking about some equation or other". Stuart regaled us with tales of
staying at Terry's house near Newbury; one weekend while Terry went into
Harwell to look after an experiment the rest of the family went out.
Unfortunately, Terry had forgotten his key to the house and so could not get in
when he was unexpectedly able to leave the experiment early. Since there
were no chairs in the garden, he had retired up a tree to think about his
current problem equation, which for ever afterwards was known as 'Terry's Tree
Function'. Stuart's current work is theoretical studies of molecular motion using computer simulation of 
lattice dynamics. Anharmonic motion is seen close to phase transitions in
computer simulations. In 1980 they used 3 by 3 by 3 unit cells with 2
molecules per cell in their model of sulphur hexafluoride. Calculations were 
made on the DAP, a Distributed Array Processor, a British built device very
well adapted to this type of calculation, but little supported, despite its
1000 fold improvement in speed over conventional computers. By 1997 there
has been a further improvement of 70 orders of magnitude in computing
speeds, and he expects several more to be available shortly. 
Future calculations of this type should use many more molecules with a
simple potential rather than the current calculations which use few
molecules and a highly accurate potential with many correction terms.
<p>
The final speaker was <strong>Uli Arndt</strong>, from MRC Cambridge, co-author of the
Single Crystal Diffraction book with Terry. He described the development of
hardware explaining that the first four circle diffractometer was not
designed, but grew out of the earlier Bragg ionisation chamber whose shaft
was driven by stepping motors which clicked when they moved. Bragg had used
a metronome, moving the spectrometer on every time he heard a click. This
method has some advantages, varying the speed of data collection is easy,
but the experimenters become unreliable after some time, so more automated
methods were needed. Uli's contribution had been to automate the data
collection, essential when the more expensive neutrons were used.  He first
met Terry when working on neutron instrumentation for which funding was
available because of the high cost of the neutrons. It was hard to get
computing time to calculate the initial setting angles for the
diffractometer in those days, so he and David Phillips invented a type of
linear diffractometer instead. It was a sort of mechanised Ewald Sphere.
When P.P.Ewald came to their Laboratory, they proudly showed it to him
saying it was one of his grandchildren, to which he replied, "Why do I have
such an ugly grandchild?"
<p>
He also told us of first developments of low temperature crystallography at
the Royal Institution when Kathleen Lonsdale and Smith had performed
their experiment at -5° C. 
<p>
Another problem with automation was that instructions were read into the
diffractometer on paper tape and results punched out on the same media. This
was done by Creed teleprinters, which had been originally designed to print the latest
stock market prices in gentlemens' clubs, a task requiring only a few minutes
an hour. They regularly failed to run continuously overnight, so several
sets of teleprinters replicated the results in the hope that at least one of
them might still be working by morning!  Ferranti had already made a device
for the accurate setting of a 3-axis milling machine for military purposes;
this was adapted for a diffractometer, but in this guise it was found to be
much less reliable. The reason was because when the Ferranti accountants 
found out that this project was not for military applications, they insisted
their engineers stop wastefully using highly reliable transistors (which
cost one shilling) in the circuitry and made them substitute the cheaper
less reliable six penny ones. There were no integrated circuits in those
days, and the general public was expected to tolerate this unreliability,
whereas the military were not. 
<p>
Medical work needs X-ray measurements on large molecules, which give rise to very
large numbers of reflections. For example a 100 Angstrom unit cell can produce
64,000 reflections, which was far more than the electronics of those days
could cope with, so reflections were stored on photographic film for later
measurements.  Later they worked on storing data on an image plate detector,
which was eventually marketed by Enraf-Nonius in Delft. Hardware development
of this device was very quick; that of the software took much longer.
<p>
 Uli Arndt reflected that these days the hardware is built less accurately;
instead people write calibration and correction routines to compensate for
the inaccuracies into the controlling software. Today people build 1 meter
square detectors using 'image plate' storage phosphors where each incident
event creates a charge, which is read out later using a laser.   Uli first
met Terry when he was trying to adapt Uli's  instruments designed for
X-rays for use with neutrons.  
<p>
   What are the future developements in instrumentation? Uli is currently
involved in a scheme to both grow a crystal and determine its structure in a
spacecraft to be launched in the year 2002. This needs the development of a
miniature X-ray tube. (<em>Editor's Note: this is now marketed under licence
from the MRC by the Microsource Division of Bede Scientific Instruments.
For details contact Graham Fraser, Tel: 0191 3772476 
email: microsource@bede.co.uk</em>)  Computers are to be brought into the data
collection process at an earlier stage. Instead of storing the contents of
many blank positions; they will only look for events where they expect to
find them, store all those for a given row and then ship the resulting 5
Gigabytes of data for the row down to earth for later analysis. This is
necessary because astronauts are not trained crystallographers, but this
trend in  hardware developments occurs on earth as well and may mean fewer
jobs for crystallographers in future!. 
<p>
The Meeting thus ended as it had begun, with descriptions of exciting new
hardware developments, all associated in some way with the work of Terry
Willis. Colin Carlile then presented Terry with a fine red bound book 'This
is Part of your Life', signed by delegates at the conference, containing
mementoes of his work and photographs of students attending the eleven summer
schools Terry has organised over the years, seven in Harwell and more
recently four in Oxford. We wish him Many Happy Returns of the day.
