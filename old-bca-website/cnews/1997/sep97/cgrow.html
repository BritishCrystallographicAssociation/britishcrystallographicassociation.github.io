The photograph was first published on the front page of the 'Didcot Herald'
 for July 17th 1997. It shows Vicki Gayle, aged 8 from Northbourne Primary
School, Didcot holding the crystal grown by members of the winning school
team in the Primary Schools section of the Crystal Growing Competition
organised by Phil Smith of the Royal Society of Chemistry during the Summer
term.  Chieveley Primary School won second prize. Secondary school winners
were from Reading and Newbury.  The prizes were presented on 24th June 1997
at the 'Chemistry at Work' days held recently in the Waterside Centre,
Newbury, and the activities shown later that day on the local news by
Meridien TV.

A larger competition for schools in South East England is being planned for
this Autumn Term; schools will have 5 weeks to grow the crystals. The first
100 schools to enter get a commemorative Tee shirt and a copy of  the book
'Crystals' by I.F.Mercer.  The prizes will be awarded during 'National
Chemistry Week' in mid-November. I hope to have a report in the March 1998
issue of 'Crystallography News'.
