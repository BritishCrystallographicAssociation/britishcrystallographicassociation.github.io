<h1>President's Remarks September 97</h1>
<p>
I have just arrived back from a hot and sticky St. Louis where the annual
ACA Meeting was held this year. This was held in a converted railway
station, so lavishly equipped with restaurants and shops that we did not
venture outside for the whole week. The ACA meeting was extremely well
organized, with several exciting sessions, mostly in the areas of protein
crystallography, and the organizers are therefore to be warmly congratulated
on their efforts.
<p>
I was sorry to learn of the recent death of Peter Wheatley, whom many of you
will recall for his service as editor of Acta Cryst. He was unfailingly kind
and helpful, and he will be missed. Frank Allen has written an obituary,
which you can read on alater page in this newsletter and on the BCA Web
pages under obituaries.
<p>
On the happy side, congratulations to our Vice President, Frank Allen, on
his appointment as Scientific Director of the CCDC in Cambridge. Similarly,
I congratulate Lesley Dent Glasser, who was a founder member of the BCA, for
the award of an MBE in the latest Birthday Honours. That reminds me that in
the past the similarity between our names has caused confusion, and I think
I can recall once finding that we had been booked into the same room at a
Spring conference! 
<p>
I was also pleased to hear that Andrew Lang has been awarded the Hughes
Medal of the Royal Society for 1997 in recognition of his fundamental work
on X-ray physics and the development of techniques of X-ray topography.
Also, Ken Holmes has been awarded the Royal Society's Gabor Medal for his
achievements in molecular biology.
<p>
Finally, a recent trial crystal growing competition held by several schools 
was a great success, and even made it to Meridien TV. Later this year
another more extensive competition will be held, and I hope this too will
turn out well.

<h1><a name="treas">From </a>the Treasurer</h1>
<h2>No PINC for the BCA</h2>
The BCA regrets to announce that it was unsuccessful in its bid to gain 
funding under the UK Department of Trade and Industry's PINC (Professional 
Institutes Network Challenge) awards scheme, for the upgrading and 
enhancement to the electronic services we provide, including the website. 16 
organisations were successful, all of which are larger than the BCA. The 
Treasurer has a full list of the awardees and their funded projects - if you 
would like details, please contact him at the address shown on the Council 
pages of this issue.

<h2><a name="cgrow">Education </a> - Crystal Growing Competition </h2>

The photograph was first published on the front page of the 'Didcot Herald'
 for July 17th 1997. It shows Vicki Gayle, aged 8 from Northbourne Primary
School, Didcot holding the crystal grown by members of the winning school
team in the Primary Schools section of the Crystal Growing Competition
organised by Phil Smith of the Royal Society of Chemistry during the Summer
term.  Chieveley Primary School won second prize. Secondary school winners
were from Reading and Newbury.  The prizes were presented on 24th June 1997
at the 'Chemistry at Work' days held recently in the Waterside Centre,
Newbury, and the activities shown later that day on the local news by
Meridien TV.

A larger competition for schools in South East England is being planned for
this Autumn Term; schools will have 5 weeks to grow the crystals. The first
100 schools to enter get a commemorative Tee shirt and a copy of  the book
'Crystals' by I.F.Mercer.  The prizes will be awarded during 'National
Chemistry Week' in mid-November. I hope to have a report in the March 1998
issue of 'Crystallography News'.
