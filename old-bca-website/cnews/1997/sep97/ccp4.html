<h1>The CCP4 Program Suite for Protein Crystallography</h1>
<h2> Recent developments</h2>

<p>
The CCP4 Program Suite is an integrated set of programs for protein
crystallography developed in a close collaboration between crystallographers
under an initiative by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research
Council (formerly the SERC). Applications include data reduction, various
scaling programs, Patterson search and refinement, isomorphous and molecular
replacement, phase improvement (density modification), structure refinement
and presentation of results.  Since the CCP4 project was established in
1979, the suite has continued to grow, both in the number of programs
included and in the number of users.  At the latest count, the Suite
included 130 programs, and was used at 372 sites worldwide. To keep the
project at the forefront of protein crystallography, a number of initiatives
are being pursued. Some of these are reported here.<p>

We continue to make new releases of the suite as new programs are added and
existing ones improved. Version 3.2 was released in November 1996 and
included the following new programs:<p>
<ul>
  <li>MAKEDICT: will produce TNT or PROTIN dictionary entries from a PDB
    or PROTIN file (Phil Evans).
  <li> MATTHEWS_COEF: written by Misha Isupov to calculate the Matthews 
    coefficient given the cell, symmetry, number of atoms etc.
  <li> RASMOL: RasMol 2.6 (unix and VMS versions) is now distributed 
    with CCP4 (Roger Sayle).
  <li> SCALEPACK2MTZ: Convert SCALEPACK output into an MTZ file. 
</ul>
It is hoped to release Version 3.3 in the near future, with the following new
 programs:
<ul>
  <li> ARPP: AUTOMATED REFINEMENT PROGRAM from VICTOR S. LAMZIN.
    Note that "arp" has been renamed "arpp" to avoid conflict with 
    a unix command.
  <li> OMIT from Bauke Dijkstra and Fred Vellieux. Calculate omit maps
    according to procedure of Bhat.
  <li> REVISE: program to generate normalised anomlous scattering factor 
    magnitudes from MAD data (Yao Jia-xing).
  <li> wulff.ps added to 'aggregated' stuff, for generating Wulff 
    net (Ian Clifton).
</ul>
Versions of the CCP4 Suite up to 3.2 have used a pseudo-PDB format for
holding coordinate data. In version 3.3, this will be updated to the current
PDB Version 2.1 standard. The main additions will be the ANISOU record for
anisotropic U factors, and an extention to the ATOM/HETATM record to include
segment and element IDs at the end of the line. In the long term, however,
we intend to change the working co-ordinate format to an mmCIF-like format.
This should give added flexibility both in the character size allowed for
data items and in the various additional data items that can be defined.<p>

Documentation for most programs is now distributed in HTML format. Although
this documentation is also available on the CCP4 WWW site, it is intended to
be viewed locally in conjunction with running the programs.  Initially,
extensive use of hypertext links is intended to make connections between
different programs more obvious, for example in running a chain of programs.
With time, it is hoped to turn the html documentation into a more integrated
help system to guide the user through the structure solution process.<p>

On a similar theme, Liz Potterton at York has been working since January
1997 on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the program suite.  The GUI will
work as an additional layer on top of the traditional Suite. In addition to
providing a user-friendly environment, the GUI will include additional
functionality for project management and the analysis of results.  A
prototype has been developed based on several common "tasks".  This is
currently being tested, and more task interfaces being added, but is not yet
ready for public release.<p>

In common with other projects, we are making more and more use of the World
Wide Web for disseminating information. The CCP4 Home Page can be found at
<a href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/main.html">
http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/main.html</a> and includes a variety of 
information
on the program suite and other CCP4 activities. An important recent addition
is the Problems Page, which contains details of any problems with the latest
release, and what the user should do about it.  Another recent use of our
WWW site is for archive retrieval. You can already access the June 1996 and
January 1997 issues of the CCP4 Newsletter, and future issues will also
appear there. New for 1997, you will also be able to view the Proceedings of
the annual CCP4 Study Weekend on the web (in addition to their usual
distribution).<p>

The next <strong>CCP4 Study Weekend </strong>is to be held in <strong>
Reading on the 9th/10th of
January 1998.</strong> The topic is to be databases and their use by
crystallographers. Meanwhile, the next outing for the CCP4 team will be in
Lisbon for the ECM-17. We hope to see you there!

The suite is available free to academic institutions, subject to a completed
license form being returned to the CCP4 secretary, but a charge is made to
commercial users who should contact the CCP4 secretary at ccp4@dl.ac.uk to
make arrangements. Please note that all charges for the suite are used for
CCP4 activities. Further details on obtaining the Suite can be found on the
CCP4 web site <a href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP4/main.html">
