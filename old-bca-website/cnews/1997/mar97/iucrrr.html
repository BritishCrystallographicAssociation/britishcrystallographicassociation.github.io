<h1>IUCr -  CPD Quantitative Phase Analysis Round Robin </h1>
<h2>   Call for Expressions of Interest</h2>
<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Initiated and Organized by the IUCr Commission on Powder Diffraction (CPD)
<P>
<strong><BR>Aims of the Round Robin:</strong><br>
  The round robin will focus on the analysis of powder diffraction data
specifically for the derivation of quantitative phase abundance. While the
study will focus on the use of laboratory X-ray, synchrotron X-ray and
neutron diffraction data, other methods may be used to validate the
diffraction results (e.g. FTIR, normative analysis, etc.). The additional
methods used will be at the discretion of the participant.<BR>

<P>
<strong>General aims: </strong><br>
 The general goals of the round robin will include the following:-<br>
<UL>
<LI>To document the methods &amp; strategies commonly employed in
    Quantitative Phase Analysis (QPA), especially those involving powder
    diffraction
<LI>To access levels of accuracy &amp; precision, and lower limits of detection
<LI>To identify specific problem areas &amp; develop practical solutions
<LI>To formulate recommended procedures for QPA using diffraction data
<LI>To create a standard set of samples for future reference
</UL>
<P>
<strong><BR>Specific aims: </strong><br>
The round robin will address the following analytical issues:-<br>
<UL>
<LI><em>Type of analysis:</em> diffraction (X-ray /Neutron) vs non-diffraction,
    internal std vs external std vs spiking etc, standardless methods
<LI><em>Sample features:</em>    representivity &amp; homogeneity, 
particle &amp; crystallite size, statistics &amp; microabsorption, 
crystallinity &amp; surface roughness, preferred orientation, 
microabsorption &amp; extinction
<LI><em>Data collection:</em>    type of instrument / geometry, 
sample preparation, data range and wavelength
<LI><em>Data analysis: </em>     integrated intensities vs full-profile, 
Rietveld vs data-base of observed patterns, 
use of constraints and corrections, software systems &amp; methods, 
complexity of the pattern - peak overlap
</UL>
<P>
<strong><BR>Proposed Samples: </strong><br>
   The samples used in the study will consist of mixtures of major and minor
components covering a wide range of analytical complexity. All synthetic
samples contain a minor impurity phase (spinel -
MgAl<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>) to provide an ambiguity of chemistry as well
as providing estimates of the accuracy and precision of trace phases.<BR>

<strong>Types of analyses: </strong><br>
      The involvement of participants in the round robin can vary depending
on the amount of time available to each individual/laboratory.  However,
since the success of the round robin will depend on the number of results
returned, full participation is encouraged.

<P>
Possible levels of participation will include the following:-<BR>
<P>
 <strong>Material supplied by CPD  Participant actions</strong><br>
 <strong>Diffraction data only:</strong>  Participant analyses 'standard' 
data sets supplied by the CPD and returns details of the analytical 
procedure plus the results. <br>
 <strong>Prepared samples:</strong> Participant collects own data for analysis from at least 
  two of the samples supplied by the CPD ('simple' and 'preferred orientation')<BR>
<strong>Unprepared samples:</strong>
  Samples supplied by the CPD are representative of bulk, but may need 
  additional preparation. Participant prepares samples for data collection 
   and analysis.<br>

<P>
     Since the purpose of the round robin is to assess the methods of
quantification, and not identification, the identity of each of the
component phases will be supplied. For those participants using Rietveld
based methods for the analysis, full structural information for each of the
phases will also be supplied. <P>

     Participants will be asked to return the results using 'standard'
reporting forms. This should minimize the number of errors likely to occur
during transcription of the data. In addition, it is requested that the
diffraction data be returned to the CPD as an ASCII format file for
re-analysis with a 'standard' Rietveld code.

Laclan Cranswick has set up a Web site at:<br>
  <a href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/SRS/XRD/IUCR/QARR">
     http://www.dl.ac.uk/SRS/XRD/IUCR/QARR</a><BR>
which has 'standard X-ray data' for testing quantitative analysis. This is
mostly inorganic and mineral Powder X-ray data, but there are also samples
on request for neutron diffraction analysis and recently pharmaceutical
powder X-ray data has been added.

<P>
Crystal structure information from the literature relevant to this
pharmaceutical data will be added later for the benefit of those who are
using structure based methods and do not have access to a library of
structure database.
