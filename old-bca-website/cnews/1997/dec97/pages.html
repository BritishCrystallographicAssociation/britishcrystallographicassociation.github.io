<strong><BR>From the President<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
Winter is now on its way, and once again we have to begin to think about the
next Spring Meeting of the BCA. This time it will be the turn of the
University of St. Andrews, with its many attractions (I believe that golf
enthusiasts know about this), and I hope that as many of you as possible
will make the effort to attend. To help in this, we are departing from
normal practice, by beginning the meeting on a Sunday; this will allow you
to come up on the day before and take advantage of the cheaper travel. <P>

<P> I think it worth mentioning that there are stirrings on the European
scene. This summer during the Lisbon Meeting, the European Crystallographic
Association (ECA) was formally set up, and a President (C. Giacovazzo) was
voted in. It is early days, but it is hoped that the ECA will be able
represent all our interests on a larger scale than we can on our own.
Details of the ECA will be published as and when we get information. Frank
Allen has been voted onto the ECA committee and no doubt he will keep us
informed. <P>

<P>
Another matter that will concern BCA members is our link with the Royal
Society. <BR>The Royal Society is presently conducting an exercise with all
its member organisations to assess how strongly they are connected with
their various international bodies. At present, the United Kingdom has 5
delegates to the International Union of Crystallography. Recently, the Royal
Society has stopped paying subscriptions to the IUCr for one delegate, and
the BCA has had to provide the payment instead. However, this does raise the
question as to whether we should continue as a 5 delegate country. I mention
this here, because this issue is one that the BCA Council is going to have
to deal with before 1999, and I would like to hear from you (e-mail
preferred) about your feelings on this matter. <P>

<P>
Finally, can I remind you about SET98? It is important that we promote the
image of crystallography to the outside world, and this is one occasion when
we can do this. I would urge you to start thinking about SET98 and see if
you can do something in your local area for this event. In the mean time,
let me wish you all a Happy Christmas and New Year.

<strong><BR>Cover Story<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
The photograph on the cover shows the results of a computer simulation of
ion-exchange (partial Ca to K) in a zeolite (clinoptilolite) and subsequent
dehydration to remove the water.  <BR>
The clinoptilolite framework is shown
as sticks; the full spheres represent the final Ca<B><SUP>-</SUP></B> and
K<B><SUP>- </SUP></B>cation positions.  The configuration is interesting
since it seems the space between cations in the main channel is such that it
differentially adsorbs gases such as methane and nitrogen and therefore has
potential for natural gas purification.  The result shows agreement with
limited data from the synchrotron (X-ray powder diffraction, EXAFS) and
experimental gas adsorption data.

This work is by D.O'Connor, P.Barnes, D.Bates and D.Lander. The results have
been submitted for publication and form part of the Ph.D Thesis of David
O'Conner at Birkbeck College, University of London, who should be contacted
for further details, or email to Barnes@gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk
