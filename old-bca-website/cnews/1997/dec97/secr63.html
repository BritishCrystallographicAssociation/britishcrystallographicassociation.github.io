<HR>
<P>
The Inaugural Meetings of the European Crystallographic Association Council
were held in Lisbon, Portugal during ECM-17 in August 1997 and the ECC
(European Crystallographic Committee ) disbanded.  It's last act was to
decide that the next European Crystallographic Meeting should be held in
Nancy, France in 2000. <BR>The following officers of the ECA were elected: 
<BR>  President: Carmello Giacovazzo (Italy), Vice-President :Joel Bernstein
(Israel), Secretary: Paul Buerskens (The Netherlands)  and Treasurer: Sybolt
Harkema (The Netherlands) . Three Ordinary members of the Council were
elected: <BR>    Frank Allen (UK), Maria Carrondo (Portugal) and Peter
Paufler (Germany).

<P>
The Secretary is re-drafting the Statutes to include the discussed
amendments prior to the incorporation of the ECA in The Netherlands.  At the
closing ceremony of ECM-17 the President welcomed the creation of the ECA
and urged all European Crystallographers to support the new organisation and
help define it aims.

<strong><BR><a name="oldnews">Editorial</a> - Any old BCA
 Newsletters?<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
John Robertson has kindly donated his copies of the 'Institute of Physics
Crystallography Group Newsletter' to form the basis of an 'Editor's Archive'
of past BCA Newsletters. His collection runs from No,1 May 1957 to No. 64
(Dec 1980) and is almost complete. I would be grateful for copies of the few
missing ones, No.s 3 (Nov 57), 9 (Feb 59), 16 (Mar 62), 22 (Mar 64) and 58
(Jul 79).
Please send them to the editor at the address on page 64. <P> I
would also be grateful for any older copies of the current series of the BCA
newsletter.  The archive has copies starting with issue no, 37 June 1991,
copies of earlier ones would be very welcome.  While doing your Spring
Cleaning in 1998, don't just throw out old newsletters, donate them to the
BCA Editor's Archive.
<p>
<strong>Note added Jan 98- Thanks, and still a few missing</strong><br>
Many thanks to all those who responded to my plea.  I will try to get an
index to these past issues as soon as I can. 
I now have almost a complete set of the newer newsletters, the missing ones
are <strong>from 1982/3 no.s 3,4,5  </strong>
and from the earlier series of <strong>XRAG newsletters 
no.s 3(Nov 57) 9 (Feb59) 16 (Mar62) 22 (Mar 64) and 58 (Jul 79). </strong>
