I first met Helen Megaw in 1969 at the StonyBrook IUCr Meeting. She was
looking for a postdoctoral assistant to work on phase transitions in sodium
niobate, and Kathleen Lonsdale, who had been my Ph.D. supervisor, had
recommended me for this post. At the time I was at the Chemistry Department
at Harvard; my interest was in the crystallography of organic compounds. I
therefore accepted Helen's offer with some reluctance, because I did not
feel I could cope with inorganic materials. Anyway, it all worked out well
and I went to the Cavendish Laboratory and turned myself into some sort of
physicist.

<P>
I soon discovered that my boss was a remarkable person: formidable in some
ways, but also very kind and patient. She had a particularly interesting
gift: if you wanted to know what a particular crystal structure looked like
from a particular direction, she could somehow turn it around in her mind
and then sketch it for you. In the days before computer graphics, this was a
very useful trick.

<P>
I think it is worth repeating here the story I told at the Leeds conference
dinner, because it reveals another aspect of Helen's character. I wrote a
paper on the tilting of octahedra in perovskites and sent it to the Editor
of Acta Cryst. Eventually I received a reply including more than 20 pages of
closely typed comments from a referee. <I>How dare the referee pull my paper
apart like this!</I> 

<P>
I went to Helen to show her, complaining bitterly about the referee and his
attitude. Helen looked through the comments and agreed they were over the
top. Anyway, she spent hours with me helping me to satisfy many of the
comments raised and the revised paper was sent back. I had to admit, that
the the paper was in fact much better, and subsequently it became one of the
most quoted of my published works. It was a few years later that Helen
confided that she had been the referee! The Editor had sent it to her in
error and she had pointed this out, but said that she could be objective
nonetheless.

<P>
I was reminded of all this, when recently I was approached by Martha Keyes
at the University of California Los Angeles. Martha has been putting
together a series of web pages on the impact of women in physics, and this
includes some pages on crystallographers.(see list opposite (  I was able to
supply some information for this regarding Helen Megaw and I was also able
to put her in touch directly with Helen in Ballycastle.  A copy of their
information about Helen is printed on the opposite page.

<BR><B>Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics</B><BR>
<HR>
<P>
In 1999 the American Physical Society(APS) will celebrate its centenary with
many events which will include exhibits on the history of physics. (see
their Web site at URL<BR><B>http://www.aip.org/history/exhibit.htm</B> ) For
the celebration, the Committee on the Status of Women in Physics and the
Forum on the History of Physics of the APS are co-sponsoring the creation of
an historical archive  entitled  <B><I>Contributions of 20th Century Women
to Physics</I></B>. This is a project whose purpose is to compile an
electronic archive of citations of women  who have made original and
important contributions to physics this century. The citations include brief
descriptions of these contributions documented with references to published
papers. Some biographical information is also included.   Their list of
women crystallographers is:

The name <B>Helen D. Megaw Island </B>was given to an island in the
Antartica, located at about 66.9 &deg; S, 67.7 &deg; W. This honor was
bestowed when the Glaciological Society was naming features in that
neighborhood after scientists who had done some original work on ice. [See
