<h2>From the President.</h2>

<p>
Many thanks to Mark Thornton-Pett and his team for the excellent Spring
Meeting that many of us have just enjoyed in Leeds. The scientific content
was of a high standard and at the same time entertaining, and the conference
facilities were second to none. As President I was conscious of having to be
everywhere at the same time, with one committee meeting after another:
nevertheless I did get to many of the sessions and activities and thoroughly
enjoyed it all. Mind you, by the time the weekend came I crashed out!  Well,
next year it will be Phil Lightfoot's turn to organise our meeting, this
time at the University of St. Andrews.  I know it is a long way to go, but I
hope you will make the effort to attend. I believe that there are other
attractions in the area besides crystallography.

Note that there will not be a BCA meeting in 1999, as that will be the year
of the IUCr Congress in Glasgow.

 At the banquet in Leeds, I pointed out that it will shortly be the 90th
birthday of one of our oldest (if not the oldest) members, 
<a href="megaw.html">Dr. Helen Megaw,</a>
and we arranged for everyone to sign a greeting card to her. I hope to get
it to her in Northern Ireland, where she retired, in due course. In the
meantime I would like to wish her a Happy Birthday from myself and from the
BCA.<br>
