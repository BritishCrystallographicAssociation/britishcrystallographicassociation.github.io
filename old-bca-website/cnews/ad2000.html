ADVERTISING  POLICY <BR> FOR  '<I>CRYSTALLOGRAPHY  NEWS</I>' 2000</H1>
<p align=center>( http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/CNews/ad2000.html )</p>

<P>
CRYSTALLOGRAPHY NEWS is a unique quarterly publication in that it represents
and reaches almost all crystallographers and crystallography laboratories in
the UK and is also sent to a number of crystallographers across the world;
we usually print 900 copies. It is an ideal medium for advertising meetings
and commercial products used for such things as:

The charging policy for full page (A5) commercial advertisements is that
original display material, normally contributed to the editor at A4 size,
will be included at the following rates, (price per page, per issue, in
&pound; sterling):

<P>
For <B>monochrome </B>printing:<BR>
<ul>
  <li><B> &pound;220 </B>for a page inserted in one, two, or three issues
  <li><B> &pound;180 </B> for each page booked in advance for four or more
 issues (one year) usually booked in December for the 4 issues of the next year.
</ul></p>
<P>
<B>Colour printing </B>is possible on the covers and centre pages, 
which are printed on glossier paper. <br>
<b>Add &pound;150 per page</B> for any colour printing. Our printer finds
that best colour reproduction comes from photographic prints or negatives, 
(not digitally made prints) which the printer will
scan. Images may also be submitted electronically on PC disc, GIF, TIFF, JPEG
or PostScript format. However, you probably get better reproduction from :<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>4 colour separations (cyan, magenta, yellow, black)</strong>on
  <li> <em> positive film
  <li> right reading
  <li> emulsion down 
  <li>with a 175 screen.</em>
</ul><br>
 The following sizes are suggested:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Trim size:  A5  210 x 148.5 mm
   <li>Blleed size: allow at least an extra 3mm all round
  <li>Dot size: 150 dots per inch 
</ul>
</p>
<P>
<B>Special positions: </B>these are booked a year in advance; 
the inside covers and centre spread are surcharged 15%, the back cover 20%.
In the event that more than one advertiser asks for a particular position,
 preference will be given to those who have fully paid all the invoices 
the BCA has sent out during the current year. 
<P>
<B>Advertising leaflets </B>and brochures can be mailed with the
<I>March and June</I> issues only; they should be A5 size or A4 already 
folded; rates are twice the current single page rate for monochrome printing
  for each item, (2 x &pound;220 = &pound;440) but if their extra weight
 causes us to pay increased postage, an additional &pound;60 is charged.
<P>
<B>Advertising copy </B>should preferably be in the form of complete
line/text artwork with generous margins which reduces well. Contrasty
half-tone illustrations and photographs can be reproduced, but this is not
always entirely successful. Display Copy can be accepted on PC disks, as
TIFF or colour PostScript files which the editor (or printer) will print on
an A4 or A5 page.  Files may also be sent electronically to
BCA@ISISE.RL.AC.UK; contact the editor for details.<BR>
