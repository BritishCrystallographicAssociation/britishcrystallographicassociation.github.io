<h3>Location Announced </h3>
<p>
The 'Times' for 14 March 2000 reported on the front page that Lord
Sainsbury, the Science Minister, said the synchrotron research facility
would be based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire instead
of the expected site at Daresbury near Warrington. The decision was taken
by the Prime Minister.

    <h3>Questions in Parliament about Diamond during November 1999 </h3>
<p>
The location of the new synchrotron was the subject of the
following written Parliamentary Question from Helen Southworth, Member
of Parliament for Warrington South on 25 November 1999:<br>
<br><I>
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is
taking to ensure an informed decision on the site for the new
synchrotron.
</I>        
</p><P>
The answer from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was as 
follows:<br>
</p><p>
<I>
I have considered the issues carefully and it is clear to me that on
scientific and financial grounds the choice of a site for the new
synchrotron lies between the two main sites of the Central Laboratory
for the Research Councils: the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire and the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire.  There has been a number
of studies looking at the project proposals and the sites.  At the same
time, however, the project has been evolving, for example with the
announcement in August of the French Government’s participation in the
project and changing views on capacity requirements and technical
solutions.  I am, therefore, commissioning two further studies to
inform a final decision on the site.
<P>
First, I have asked the Director General of Research Councils to seek
the views of synchrotron users on what they see as the key issues of
relevance to a decision on the site for the new synchrotron.  He will
be doing this in the course of the next month or so.
<P>
Second, we will be commissioning an external engineering survey and
report on the two potential sites for the new synchrotron.  I have
asked for this report by early January to enable me to make a final
decision in the light of all the evidence and announce it by mid
January.

<h2>Synchrotron News from the DTI or OST</h2>
<p>
The Office of Science and Technology issued the following 
statement on 9 May 2000.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>"SYNCHROTRON - MINISTERIAL MEETING WITH FRANCE</strong>
<br><br>
An article in the Financial Times today (9 May) entitled "Minister aids 
French X-ray laboratory" implied that at the Ministerial meeting held on 
the 5 May, the UK made a commitment to fund a new synchrotron to be 
built in France.  This is incorrect.  The correct position is as stated in the 
joint anglo-french press release, copy attached.  Namely, that the new 
French Minister confirmed his commitment to the New Synchrotron to be 
built at RAL, and that discussions were held on the possibility of the UK, 
together with other countries, participating in some future unspecified 
synchrotron project proposed to be built in France as part of ongoing 
European discussions on the future requirements for large scientific 
facilities.  No specific proposals were discussed and no commitment to 
fund such a project made."
</em></p><p>
The statement issued by the Department of Trade and Industry on Friday 
was as follows.<br><br>

<em><strong>"MINISTERS MEET ON SYNCHROTRON</strong>

At a meeting in Paris today, UK Science Minister Lord Sainsbury and his 
French counterpart, Mr Schwartzenberg confirmed their intention to work 
together on a 3rd generation synchrotron to be built on the site of the 
Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory near Oxford.  The two Ministers also 
wish to advance the finalising of the technical specification and 
organisational structure of the project to enable French and British 
scientists to benefit from the new synchrotron as quickly as possible.

They also had a fruitful discussion on the possibility of the United 
Kingdom participating with other partners in a 3rd generation synchrotron 
to be located in France.  The two facilities would enable the scientific 
community in the future to cover a wide range of applications of 
synchrotron radiation."</em>

<h2>From The Times</h2>
<p>
  <em>The Times</em> 27 November 1999 page 30 reported:<br>
In an article about the growing wealth and influence of Wellcome that:<br>
<em>"Only this week, the trust set out its opposition to plans to site a new
molecular research facility at the Daresbury laboratory in Cheshire.
Wellcome has threatened to withdrawthe £110 million funding it has promised
- two thirds of the total needed - if the Government presses ahead and
ignores the claims of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, a
site in the heart of a much larger scientific community."</em>
<a name="991122"><hr></a>
<p>
Page 24 of <em>The Times</em> for 22 Nov 1999 reported "Dismay 
at delay over science base" Paul Durman writes that <em>The Times</em>
has been told that Mr Steven Byers,
(Secretary of State for Science and Industry), does not intend to take a final decision until after Christmas.
