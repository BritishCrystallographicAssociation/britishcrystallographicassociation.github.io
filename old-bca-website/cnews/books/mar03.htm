<P>
This is an impressive book, not only in its size but also as the possible
inheritor of the reputation garnered by the first edition published in 1992.
The authors acknowledge the extensive advances in crystallography over the
past decade and set themselves the task of augmenting and updating the
material in the first edition: for example, a new Chapter 4 draws together
pre-existing and new material on non-ideal crystals. The book is organised
into ten chapters, most penned by a single author. The majority of chapters
have appendices containing supplementary material on specialist and
mathematical topics, and the authors have included a CD with browser-based
software to facilitate the teaching and learning of the crystallographic
concepts described in Chapters 1-3.

<P>
The first Chapter (CG) is entitled "Symmetry in crystals" and covers the
concepts required for the remainder of the book: these include symmetry
elements, lattices, point groups, symmetry and Laue classes, crystal
systems, Bravais lattices and of course space groups. The definitions,
properties and consequences of all these are illustrated by well-chosen
examples. This chapter has a substantial set of appendices to which the more
advanced material is relegated, making the main text more accessible.

<P>
The second chapter (CG) entitled "Crystallographic Computing" covers a wide
range of procedures implicitly or explicitly used in routine
crystallographic calculations. These include metric aspects, reciprocal
lattice calculations, relationships between parameters, basis
transformations and orthogonalisation. Next, a number of simple but
fundamental calculations are described: these involve torsion angles,
least-squares mean planes and Niggli reduced cells. Electron density and
structure factor calculations are dealt with, before beginning a major
section on least squares refinement. The least squares problem is outlined
in principle and the properties of both linear and non-linear refinement are
explored. Their application to a wide range of crystallographic procedures
is described, with particular emphasis on two areas, namely Rietveld
refinement against powder data and structure refinement against observed
structure factor moduli, the latter being most commonly associated with
single crystal data. The treatment of key parameters such as atomic
coordinates, atomic displacement parameters and overall scale, occupancy,
absolute structure and extinction parameters is followed by a valuable
section dealing with practical aspects of refinement such as the computing
time required, different refinement approximations, possible problems, and
the features to be expected in an effective least squares program. The
sources and consequences of a range of systematic errors and the role of
constraints and restraints are then discussed, before brief descriptions of
maximum likelihood and gradient methods as alternative refinement methods.
The next section is a substantial exposition of Rietveld refinement,
beginning with descriptions of the main steps leading to the point where
refinement can begin followed by the basis of the method ,including the
establishment of the optimum peak shape function, and ending with an
informative enumeration of some practical aspects. The next two sections
cover related topics, the analysis of thermal motion and its effects on
molecular geometry. A final section addresses the question of the accuracy
of refined parameters.

<P>
Chapter 3 (CG) introduces the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, giving an
account of the properties of X-rays and how they are scattered, and
demonstrating Bragg's Law. A section on symmetry deals <I>inter alia</I>
with Friedel's Law, systematic absences, space group identification and the
phase problem. The aim here is to allow an understanding of diffraction
effects by modelling the radiation, the crystal and their interaction. The
description of Thomson scattering includes a derivation and explanation of
the polarisation factor. There is a good explanation of atomic temperature
factors, both isotropic and anisotropic, along with some of the assumptions
and dependences involved. A major section is devoted to factors which affect
diffraction intensities, including mosaic structure, various crystal
defects, and primary and secondary extinction. Anomalous dispersion is
considered, from its origins in resonance between bound electrons and an
incident X-ray beam with similar frequency, through real and imaginary
dispersion corrections and the effects on Friedel's Law. The appendices
include a concise outline of neutron scattering which could equally well be
associated with Chapter 5 (experimental methods), but some generalisations
about the need for large crystals and deuterium substitution should be
qualified. Other appendices cover charge density and electron diffraction
studies.

<P>
Chapter 4 (CG) entitled 'Beyond Ideal Crystals' provides a useful
introduction to eight topics ranging progressively further from the ideal
crystalline state, starting with crystalline twins and finishing with gases.
No attempt is made to give a comprehensive coverage of these topics, rather
an overview of the area with key definitions is provided, and references are
given to reviews and other more specialised texts in each of the areas
covered. The areas included in this chapter are crystalline twins, diffuse
scattering, modulated structures, quasicrystals, liquid crystals, the
paracrystal concept, and amorphous and liquid states and gases, including a
section on small angle scattering. The approach is more mathematical than
some of the other chapters, but there are some good illustrations
particularly for quasicrystals, and some useful tables, especially in the
twinning section. Appendices include further practical information about
twins including some examples taken from a paper by Herbst-Irmer and
Sheldrick. The sections are illustrated by examples drawn from many areas of
science - from minerals to biological materials - and overall it helps to
illustrate the breadth of crystallography.

<P>
Chapter 5 (HLM &amp; GA) gives an extensive and thoroughly updated review of
'Experimental methods in X-ray and neutron crystallography'. The chapter
takes the reader from the production and definition of the radiation beam,
through methods of detection and data collection strategies, to data
reduction for both types of radiation and for both single crystals and
polycrystalline materials - all in a very readable style. It includes
information on laboratory and synchrotron X-ray sources, including a mention
of the microsource, and of both reactor and pulsed neutron sources, with
discussion of the optics and types of detector used. A wide range of camera
and diffractometer geometries for both single crystal and powder diffraction
is discussed and there is also a section on <I>in situ</I> measurements
under non-ambient conditions. Data reduction covers commonly applied
corrections such as Lorentz, polarisation (for both conventional and
synchrotron X-ray sources), absorption and radiation damage corrections.

<P>
Entitled 'Solution and refinement of crystal structures', Chapter 6 (DV) is
very skilfully written to make the material impressively accessible. The
chapter opens with a description of statistical analysis of structure-factor
amplitudes, and then moves on to give a description of the Patterson
function and its uses in very clearly written text. This is followed by a
discussion of the heavy atom method for structure solution with several
worked examples in different space groups, and in one case with more than
one heavy atom. Direct methods is then covered in a similarly lucid manner.
The final sections of this chapter deal with completing and refining the
structure and are largely concerned with the least-squares method. More
mathematical detail of some of these topics is given in the appendices.

<P>
There then follow two complementary Chapters covering inorganic (GF) and
molecular (GG) crystals, respectively. Chapter 7, whose full title is
"Mineral and inorganic crystals" begins with an attempt to distinguish these
from organic materials, but some of the wording is slightly unhelpful:
stating that "almost the totality of minerals is based on elements other
than H, C, N and O" could easily be read to mean the exclusion of these from
mineral compositions, hardly what was intended! An extensive section then
considers bonding aspects and how bond types (ionic, covalent, metallic,
etc) affect properties such as hardness, conductivity, appearance, melting
behaviour, cleavage and morphology. Ionic radii and their consequences for
the structures of simple solids are explored, as are fundamental aspects
such as the packing of spheres, coordination polyhedra and interstitial
sites. The applications of the charge distribution method and the effective
coordination number in order to rationalise structural features are
explored. There follows one short section on polymorphism and the possible
mechanisms of polymorphic transitions, and one on substitution and solid
solutions. A survey of structural types includes closest-packed and
close-packed structures (with and without the filling of interstitial
sites), layer structures and structures containing complex anions, the most
extensive, diverse and significant of the last being the silicates. The
chapter ends with an account of modular structures, polytypism,
order/disorder and modulated structures, and the phenomena which impinge on
ideal crystals to produce real ones
.
<P>
Chapter 8 'Molecules and molecular crystals' covers some of the key aspects
of the analysis of the structures of small molecules, in particular of
organic compounds. It is divided into an introduction and four main
sections. The first of these sections is entitled 'the nature of molecular
crystals' and discusses intermolecular forces including hydrogen bonding and
how these lead into crystal structure predictions. The second section
presents elements of classical stereochemistry providing useful definitions
of some key aspects of conformation and configurations of structures,
including a discussion of isomerism and analysis of ring conformation. The
third main section, 'Molecular structure and chemical bond', presents
various approaches to classifying or interpreting observed molecular
geometries in terms of theories of chemical bonding, covering some of the
most widely used methods. These include a short section on
quantum-mechanical methods and some more qualitative approaches only
applicable to particular types of structures such as VSEPR, ligand field
theory and molecular mechanics. The final section is devoted to the
interpretation of molecular structures, or what is often described as the
study of structure-property relationships. Unsurprisingly, given the
author's interests, this section also includes classifications of hydrogen
bonds: one minor reservation concerning this section is that it possibly
fails to indicate the level of controversy in classifying hydrogen bonds,
and the examples chosen are less wide-ranging than they could have been.

<P>
	Chapter 9 (GZ) provides a detailed description of protein (more precisely,
macromolecular) crystallography, starting with an outline of some of the
advances in the field since the first such structures were determined 40
years ago. Many of the advances, for example in computing hardware and
software or the utilisation of area detectors, have parallels in chemical
crystallography, but others such as isomorphous replacement are largely
confined to macromolecules. One result of these advances is seen in the
rapid increase in the annual number of additions to the Protein Data Bank.
After an introduction to protein structure and function, the author embarks
on the methodology, starting with the techniques of the key stage of protein
crystallisation: extreme conditions much be avoided lest the protein degrade
or the resulting structure be too different from that found <I>in vivo</I>,
but variation of <I>p</I>H, salt concentration, organic solvent and
precipitant, are possible. Although there are simpler methods, the most
widely used today (such as hanging drop) are based on vapour diffusion.
While cooling protein crystals can greatly extend their lifetime under
irradiation, their high solvent content requires the use of a cryoprotectant
regime to prevent icing: flash cooling then also confers many of the
advantages seen for simpler compounds. The text describes the preparation
and exploitation of isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives in solving novel
protein structures <I>via</I> the location of the heavy atoms by single
isomorphous replacement (SIR), multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and
anomalous scattering, including multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD)
experiments using tuneable sources. After optimisation of the heavy atom
positions, the next step is to improve the electron density maps.
Alternative methods of solving macromolecular structures include molecular
replacement and, in special cases, direct methods. Model building proceeds
by using molecular graphics which allow segments of protein chain to be
fitted to the electron density. The complexity and limited resolution of
typical structures require that refinement must employ extensive constraints
and restraints but, even so, significant manual adjustments to the model may
be needed. Useful geometric indicators include the Ramachandran plot, which
flags amino acids with suspicious chain conformations. This chapter ends
with a discussion of solvent regions, a cautionary sub-section on the
relevance of crystal structure to <I>in vivo</I> structure, and finally a
discussion of the challenging but promising field of dynamical biological
crystallography.

<P>
Chapter 10 (MC) discusses the physical properties of crystals. This final
chapter concerns crystal physics, which it considers as a bridging
discipline between crystallography and solid state physics. The chapter is
divided into two main areas: the first presents the effects of crystal
anisotropy and symmetry on the physical properties of matter. An initial
introduction is given into crystal anisotropy and tensors and this framework
is used to present a number of physical properties broadly presented as
electrical and mechanical properties with the example of piezoelectricity
given which bridges these two areas. The presentation is somewhat dry for
this section, but it is coherent, and the examples are carefully chosen to
illustrate certain types of properties and use of tensors. Theoretical
methods used to model these behaviours are also presented. The second part
of the chapter is devoted to crystal defects and the necessity of
considering them in explaining some very important phenomena of real
crystalline solids, e.g. mechanical behaviour and all transport processes in
crystals, e.g. diffusion and electrical conductivity. This section is more
readable, and covers several types of defects: point defects, planar defects
such as stacking faults, line defects or dislocations, and the effect of
these deviations from an ideal crystalline state on the properties of the
crystal. It also presents the use of X-ray topography in these studies.

<P>
One minor complaint is that some of the text would have benefited from some
careful editing of the English, because in some cases it is not as clear or
correct as it might have been. The authors have decided, possibly on grounds
of space, to include only scant coverage of crystallographic databases such
as the CSD and ICSD. In general, however, this is an extensive and
thoroughly updated textbook gathering together a great of deal of
information: it succeeds as an introduction to many areas of the field and
provides a valuable indication of the breadth of our subject.

This booklet is intended to be used by adults to try to interest children in
the differences between materials.  It is aimed at children just starting
primary school aged roughly between  5 and 7. Simple activities and
experiments for the children are described in colourful pages with large
print which some of the older children may be able to read for themselves. 
There are guidance notes for the adults, including pages of 'Materials you
will need', 'Hints for helpers', a glossary of terms illustrated by simple
colour drawings and an index. The materials are all common objects which
could be found in most family homes and the activities ones which do not
need batteries so the book could be useful to any parents faced with the
plaintive cry 'What can I do now?' from a child cooped up in the house on a
rainy day towards the end of school holidays.  The booklet attempts to
answer such questions as "Where do metals come from? or 'How are crystals
formed?.  They suggest growing crystals from washing soda.

<P>
Let me say right away that I have very mixed feelings about this book.  It
has much to commend it, and I was very favourably impressed as I started to
read it.  However, this was tempered by numerous shortcomings that emerged
as I proceeded.  It is, therefore, only a qualified recommendation that I
finally make for it.

<P>
The book sets out "to present a simple, practical and broad picture of
synchrotron light sources and of the corresponding experimental techniques." 
It is aimed particularly at readers who have little or no practical
experience of synchrotron radiation (SR), particularly new graduate
students.  One of its main tasks, then, is to explain some of the jargon
that has grown up with the development of SR over several decades.

<P>
The most positive aspects are the opening chapters, providing information
about the basics of SR: its nature and properties, and the production and
conditioning of radiation suitable for various experimental purposes. 
Explanations are given at two levels, a relatively qualitative one in the
main text, and a more rigorously mathematical treatment in a series of
clearly marked "Insets".  The simpler explanation will satisfy many readers,
while the deeper level is available for those who want more detail.  I found
these sections (skipping the Insets initially) easy to read and generally
useful, and the informal style of writing helps.  The different magnetic
components of modern storage rings, responsible for generating SR with a
range of characteristics, are well explained, together with some of the
experimental arrangements and ways of operating SR facilities, and important
properties such as coherence and polarisation.  In this way, I reached the
end of two of the book's five chapters (70 out of about 250 pages) with a
generally very positive impression.

<P>
However, these sections are not without their problems, which include errors
in some of the equations and incorrect units for physical quantities, and
these are scattered throughout the book.  Further flaws in later sections
include the reversal of the definitions of cations and anions, errors such
as the name potassium for the element with symbol P, and some symbols in
equations that are confusingly different from those commonly used  (such as
<I>f</I> for structure factors and <I>F</I> for molecular scattering factors
in the treatment of Fourier transforms in crystallography).  The English is
odd in places, which does not promote comprehension, and some of the
descriptions of storage ring operations seem distinctly out of date and may
be a legacy of material adapted from the author's previous and shorter text
of 1985 (described in the Preface).

<P>
The longest chapter (more than half the book) is devoted to a description of
applications of SR, divided into sections on imaging, spectroscopy,
microscopy, EXAFS specifically, scattering and diffraction, and
microfabrication techniques.  The treatment here seems to me to be very
variable, reflecting the author's own specialist interests.  There is a
clear bias towards biological and medical applications, which appear to be
the best treatments, while applications in the physical sciences and
engineering are less convincingly covered.  The majority of examples in some
of these areas are biological and medical, including a major emphasis on
macromolecular rather than chemical crystallography, on medical imaging, and
on biological spectroscopy.  Since this is a review for <I>Crystallography
News</I>, I should say that I found many of the explanations and arguments
in the crystallography section far from convincing and clear, especially
regarding the phase problem, Patterson functions (particularly confusing),
structure factors, and convolution.  These are topics that are not
specifically SR-related, and they seem to betray a lack of expertise in this
area for the author.  This is certainly not a primary reference for the
basics of the experimental techniques!  You should go elsewhere for that.

<P>
The book reverts to its initial style and attractiveness in dealing with
some advanced topics at the end, particularly in the treatment of free
electron lasers.

<P>
In conclusion, the book (much less expensive, as a paperback, than some of
OUP's other recent publications) is a useful introduction to synchrotron
radiation for those who know little about it and its uses, but it needs to
be read in conjunction with better descriptions of some of the scientific
applications.  It's a pity about some of the serious errors.  It would be
worth having a copy for research groups making (or considering making)
limited use of synchrotron facilities as non-experts.

<B>No. 20 : Crystals - A Handbook for School Teachers</B>

28 A4 pages.

<P>
<I>No. 20 </I>is a 'reprint' of a delightful booklet by Elizabeth A. Wood,
first published in 1972.  The author, aware that many school teachers may
not themselves have had much introduction to crystals, provides a series of
experiments/activities which can be carried out by children, with simple
explanations and comments.  As she says in the introduction, <I>'the essence of
science is by observation and wonder, curiosity and the effort to satisfy
that curiosity' </I> and she provides an excellent guide for children to do 
just
that, at school or at home.


<P>
There is an introductory section on aims, and then equipment and materials. 
The text of the main sections is suitable for children to use directly. 
They are about growing and examining crystals from solution (salt, borax,
sugar, alum, copper sulphate, and magnesium sulphate), crystals from a melt
(ice, phenyl salicylate, bismuth), crystals from vapour (ice, naphthalene),
observations with polarised light, other crystals that can be observed
(rocks and minerals in museums or in open country, crystals in building
stone, in jewellery, etc.).  The practical instructions are clear and simple
and leave me with the strong expectation that they will work; the comments
lead in to the ideas of characteristic crystal shape, crystal faces, 
cleavage, and the underlying structure.   The equipment used is mostly very
simple (measuring cup, teaspoon, microscope slide or upturned glass,
polaroid film,  etc.).  The suggested procedures appear to be safe, and with
cautions where appropriate, though a modern teacher would also check
C.O.S.H.H. rules.  The level looks appropriate for early years of secondary
school, or upwards.   All this should enable a young person to 'observe,
wonder and ask questions ', the stated aims of the author;  she also states
that the booklet is 'for all schools, everywhere in the world', and in
commendable support of this aim, the IUCr has provided translations in
Arabic, Czech, Polish, Russian and Spanish in addition to the original
English version.

<P>
The illustrations are the simple free-hand drawings of the 1972 original
booklet, not as sophisticated as modern computer drawn figures, but
completely clear and adequate.  In republishing the booklet on the web the
IUCr is quite right not to change this.  It might, however, have been
helpful to replace, or add to, the original three references given for
further study; the latter were all published before 1965 and are not likely
to be accessible.   This is a very minor criticism, and the pamphlet can be
very strongly recommended to all involved with encouraging young people to
take an interest in crystals.

<B>No. 21 : Crystal Packing</B><br>

<B> Angelo Gavezzotti</B><br>
20 + 4 A5 pages

<P>
<I>No. 21, Crystal Packing, </I>is new.   It is a simply and quite clearly
presented introduction to the important factors in crystal packing,
containing sections headed thermodynamics, the forces,  crystal symmetry,
symmetry elements, crystal structure descriptors, polymorphism
(thermodynamics versus kinetics), chirality, experiments, and suggestions
for the future.   There is a simple description of intermolecular forces in
ionic and molecular crystals, and formulae for the calculation of potential
are presented.  Hydrogen bonds are included, though there is little
indication of the strength of these relative to ionic or covalent bonds or
van der Waals interactions.  The effectiveness of different symmetry
elements for the packing of organic molecules in a crystal is then examined,
and their combination in space groups.  These are the factors which
determine which packing arrangement is adopted in the crystal, and their
consideration leads to an understanding of the observed distribution of
space groups for these crystals.

<P>
Throughout, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with space group
symmetry, and with the determination of crystal structures by X-ray
diffraction, as well as with thermodynamic principles (free energy, enthalpy
and entropy, G,H and S).  In the general description of the series of
teaching pamphlets the IUCr states that each is prefaced by a statement of
aims, level, necessary background etc.  Unfortunately no such statement is
given here, nor does the material appear to live up to the IUCr's usual
standards  (as in their peer-reviewed journals) of presentation, quality of
illustrations, accuracy and completeness of technical information.  For
example, in the section on crystal symmetry the author appears to say that
the only symmetry elements which may contribute to the packing of organic
molecules in crystals are the inversion centre, the 2-fold screw axis and
the glide plane; while undoubtedly these are the commonest, others certainly
do occur (3-, 4- and 6-fold screw axes, and pure rotation axes).   Likewise,
in Table 2 the heading should state that the space groups listed  are the
most commonly occurring ones, and that many others do occur, in smaller
numbers.   The blank entries in column 4 would be much more helpfully shown
as (100%), and the heading of column 5 should be 'Point group symmetry of
molecules in special positions'.  Solvent molecules often play an important
part in crystal packing, but there is no mention of them here.  Finally,
there is a brief statement that crystallisation from a racemic solution
sometimes produces chiral crystals, in which only one isomer at a time
appears, and that in these cases spontaneous resolution has been achieved.  
This appears to suggest that spontaneous resolution can occur, giving only
crystals of one optical isomer; if it ever occurs, it is rare and unusual,
and further evidence should be given.  It would be helpful to state that the
normal result of such a crystallisation is either racemic crystals, or equal
amounts of chiral crystals of opposite chirality.

<P>
Despite these criticisms,  a student with reasonable familiarity with
crystallography could use this pamphlet to make a simple start on the topic
of crystal packing, and perhaps go further with the set of references
provided.

</p>
<P>
<I>No. 22 </I> is based on material provided for a summer school in Egypt
in 1997.  The first part is concerned with points and vectors, and with
matrices and determinants.  It gives careful definitions and examples,
including instructions for inverting  2x2 and 3x3 matrices.   This material
provides the mathematical tools and concepts which are applied in the main
section (representing six lectures and 3 problem sessions) to
crystallographic topics - space group operations, crystallographic groups, a
detailed explanation of the form of the space group tables in International
Tables Volume A, followed by the use of matrices to express crystallographic
symmetry operations.  There are examples, and three problems involving
coordinate transformations, with solutions (and reasoning) provided.  The
explanations are mostly full and clear, and there are a good Table of
Contents and a good index.

</P>

<P>
Regrettably, this pamphlet does not state the kind of crystallographic
applications for which the author hoped to prepare the summer school
students, or the expected entry level.  The careful, painstaking definitions
and explanations might be helpful to some research students, but some of the
treatment of symmetry is over-elaborate for students in chemical or
biological crystallography; it may be important in solid state chemistry or
in the consideration of phase transitions.  For example the author
distinguishes 'space groups' and 'space group types':  according to the
mappings which it describes, there are an infinite number of space groups,
and 230 space group types (p40).  However, since matrices and crystal
symmetry are topics which many people working in crystallography find
difficult to understand and use, and since this pamphlet is so readily
available, it makes good sense that such people should look at it and see if
they find the approach useful.

<P>
The problem of cohesion - why matter hangs together in its non-gaseous forms
- is the fundamental problem of condensed matter physics, and has held the
attention of scientists continuously since the dawn of the modern scientific
enterprise. John Rowlinson, a distinguished liquid-state theorist, has
written a fascinating and well-documented account of this history. 
</p
<P>
Having pointed out that some of the ablest scientific minds have worked on
the puzzle of cohesion (Chapter 1), Rowlinson organised the main, and most
detailed, parts of his study (Chapters 2 to 4) round three 'big names':
Newton, Laplace and van der Waals. Newton's commitment to a corpuscular
theory of matter and his theory of universal gravitation led rather
naturally to speculations on the nature of inter-corpuscular forces. Since
the direct study of these forces did not become possible until well into the
twentieth century, scientists during earlier periods had to <I>infer</I>
information about them from macroscopic phenomena, principally (in
Rowlinson's account) capillarity (Laplace, Young and others), crystalline
elasticity (Poisson, Navier, Cauchy, and others) and condensation (Andrews,
van der Waals, and others). Studies of other phenomena, e.g. viscosity, also
contributed. As we now know, a proper understanding of cohesion requires
quantum mechanics to describe intermolecular forces, and statistical
mechanics to relate them to bulk properties. These 20<SUP>th</SUP>-century
developments are treated more briefly in Chapter 5. 
</p>
<P>
The chief strengths of this book are two. First, Rowlinson's grasp of the
science enables him to guide the reader firmly through the sometimes-obscure
reasoning of previous generations of scientists. (This does mean, however,
that the book is technically demanding.) Secondly, the book is a
bibliographic treasure trove, with more than 1000 references to original
publications spread over all the main European languages as well as Latin.
There are also short biographical notes on all but the most well known of
the scientists involved.
</p>
<P>
I have two <I>scientific</I> reservations. First, Rowlinson does not appear
to distinguish between cohesion and rigidity. On p. 1, he asks: 'Why do
gases condense to form liquids, liquids freeze to solids or, as it has been
put more vividly, why, when we lift one end of a stick, does the other end
come up too?' Condensation is indeed a matter of cohesion and attractive
intermolecular forces. But freezing  is about the emergence of rigidity -
crystals have finite zero-frequency shear moduli because they are
<I>symmetry-broken</I> states. Moreover, as Rowlinson knows (pp. 285f), hard
spheres crystallise at high density - attraction is <I>not</I> essential. A
clearer distinction between these two issues is called for. Secondly, the
final chapter is strangely silent on ionic and metallic systems. While, as
Rowlinson himself has pointed out, a comprehensive treatment of
20<SUP>th</SUP>-century sources would require a book of its own, brief
comments on these important classes of (charged) condensed systems would
have given a more well-rounded finale. 
</p>
<P>
To conclude, I should point out that reading this book, one gets a good
sense of the fitful, untidy way in which science develops. Professional
historians and philosophers, who have often lamented the tidily linear
'history' presented in science text books, should be impressed! On the other
hand, I am not convinced by Rowlinson's claim that 'sociological, political,
religious and economic' factors have had little effect on the development of
the 'specialised' subject of cohesion. I have little doubt that future
studies will show how the study of cohesion was as integrated with its
social milieu as were any other areas of science. This fine volume by
Rowlinson has laid a firm foundation for such studies.

The book is the second in a monograph series on Neutron Techniques and
Applications, edited by J. L. Finney and D. L. Worcester. The author, Chick
Wilson, is Group Leader in Crystallography and beamline scientist at the
ISIS spallation neutron facility at the CLRC Rutherford Laboratory in the
UK.

<P>
As its title suggests, the monograph focuses on single crystal neutron
diffraction, though on molecular crystals rather than materials <I>per
se</I>. There is clearly scope for a book such as this, aimed at chemists
and chemical crystallographers, which makes it clear what single crystal
neutron diffraction has accomplished and may in future be able to
accomplish. The book effectively comprises two parts, the first (chapters
1-3) in which an introduction to crystallography, neutron scattering and
single crystal neutron diffraction is provided, and the second, longer
section (chapters 4-7) in which studies conducted up to 1999 are reviewed.
The book concludes with a brief look forward (chapter 8) at the potential
for the technique in the future. This organisational style reminded me of
Dunitz's classic book on "X-ray Analysis and the Structure of Organic
Molecules" in which again there is a similar division between providing
information on the fundamentals of the technique and demonstrating its
chemical applications.

<P>
The book opens with a very brief introduction to crystallography in chapter
1. The majority of chapter 1, however, is devoted to outlining the areas
that are covered in greater detail later in the book. Chapter 2 concentrates
on neutron scattering, including very useful sections on different types of
sources and detectors. The opening component on the properties of neutrons
pertinent to scattering provides the necessary information but avoids the
physics needed to understand the observed scattering lengths. Chapter 3
focuses on techniques, and takes the reader stepwise through aspects of a
single crystal diffraction experiment that are specific to using neutrons
rather than X-rays. These chapters are probably the strongest part of the
book and reflect the author's many years of experience in single crystal
neutron diffraction. However, while this section covers virtually all the
important points, readers who are looking for more than an overview will
probably need to seek an alternative source.
</p>
<P>
The next and largest section of the book is devoted to applications of
single crystal neutron diffraction. The chapters on "The Accurate Location
of Atoms," "Hydrogen Bonding," "Vibrations and Disorder" and "Materials
Properties and Design." necessarily have some overlap, but most of the major
areas of application to molecular crystals are covered. The main omissions
are discussion of magnetic scattering and significant consideration of atoms
other than hydrogen/deuterium.
</p>
<P>
Chapter 4 covers cases in which neutron diffraction can clarify structural
ambiguities or inaccuracies in hydrogen atom position, e.g. tautomer
identification, accurate bond length determination, structures of metal
complexes with hydride and related ligands, and applications to structures
of biological macromolecules, especially in characterising the water
structure. This latter component is perhaps the best part of the chapter and
provides valuable insight into an area that clearly has potential for
important further development. Unfortunately, the major (25-page) component
on hydride and related ligands is the weakest part of the book. The
narrative works its way through studies of numerous compounds with 5-10 line
descriptions, which read somewhat like a list. Too often, the chemical
importance of the neutron diffraction study does not really come through,
other than the common fact that neutron diffraction was necessary for
accurate location of the hydride ligands. Given that there are comprehensive
reviews on this specific topic in the literature, the most recent by Bau in
1997, a more valuable approach would have been to select a smaller number of
case studies for more in-depth description. Such an approach could have been
used to emphasise the importance of the neutron diffraction study and to
bring out fully the chemical significance in each case. There are also a
number of examples of incorrect chemical nomenclature and unclear wording,
as well as misinterpretations or misunderstanding of the pertinent
chemistry.
</p>
<P> Chapter 5 provides a good overview of different types of hydrogen bonds
(strong, weak, inter- and intramolecular, bifurcated, different donor and
acceptor atoms, etc.) and different aspects of hydrogen bonding that have
been studied by single crystal neutron diffraction. However, this is again
an area in which there are many reviews available and more comprehensive
coverage is likely to be found elsewhere. The narrative style improves upon
Chapter 4, in that more extensive descriptions are provided for most
examples presented. The chapter, however, does suffer from a number of
inconsistencies and unclear statements, the worst offender being the overuse
of the description "normal" or "as predicted", mostly without a frame of
reference these terms. Section 5.2, entitled <I>'Normal' hydrogen bonds</I>
does define such interactions to be, in the author's view, hydrogen bonds of
medium length and moderate strength. However, within the same section, for
example, dialuric acid is described as having a "normal, strong hydrogenand
to crystallographic models used to describe them. Special attention is given
to hydrogen atom motions, where neutron diffraction has its greatest
advantage over X-ray methods. The chapter then concludes with a few examples
of disorder and phase transitions as studied by neutron diffraction.

</p>
<P>
	Chapter 7, on "Materials, Properties and Design", is inevitably a difficult
one to write given that the impact of neutron diffraction in this area does
not primarily involve the study of molecular crystals. The chapter includes
brief sections, with examples, on structure determinations of bioactive
small molecules, hydrogen-bonded NLO molecular materials, organic
conductors, and on X-H<SUP>...</SUP> hydrogen bonds studied in the context
of crystal engineering.
</p>

<P>
	The final chapter looks ahead to what improvements in instrumentation and
sources might be attainable and what might be achieved with access to such
facilities. Improvements in flux at the source and in utilization of those
neutrons through multiple detector instruments are noted as exciting
developments already in progress. The main area of study cited for major
future development is in the study of biological macromolecules, while the
core area of small molecule structural studies is expected to see increases
in the rate of data collection and use of smaller crystals. Perhaps
surprisingly omitted, is mention of magnetic scattering by neutrons, both
here and throughout most of the book. Given the current high-profile work in
molecular magnets based upon coordination networks, and the related area of
single-molecule magnets, one might anticipate a valuable future role for
polarised neutron single crystal diffraction studies. 
</p>

<P>
	In summary, this monograph should provide a valuable reference for chemists
and chemical crystallographers seeking an overview of the technique of
single crystal neutron diffraction and a perspective on its application to
studies of molecular crystals. There is not an abundance of texts on neutron
diffraction, and some of those most used were written many years ago. This
monograph provides an up-to-date look at the practical aspects and
applications of the technique and has an extensive list of references
following each chapter. However, it is not without its problems, primarily
in descriptions and interpretations of the chemical significance of results
in parts of Chapters 4 and 5. It should nevertheless be a useful addition to
Chemistry library holdings and, priced at<I> ca.</I> &pound;40, to some
personal collections.
