<h2>Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry</h2> 
<h3>Authors: Ron Jenkins and Robert L. Snyder</h3> 
Publisher:John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1996     403 pages 
Price:  £65 in the UK (hardback)   ISBN 0-471-51339-3 <br>
<p>
As might be expected, Jenkins and Snyder have written a really useful book.
It covers basic  crystallography, production of X-rays, instrumentation,
sample preparation, data collection and reduction, phase identification and
quantitativ phase analysis. The book concentrates on  Bragg-Brentano
geometry, being the most common for routine work, and is very practical
describing how to get started once you are in the lab with your sample.  <p>
 
 Many students use powder diffraction as one of several different techniques
to c haracterise  materials. For them the chapters on sample preparation,
data collection and redu ction, phase  identification, databases and
quantitative phase analysis give a clear and comprehensive guide of how to
find out what crystalline phases are in the sample. There are diagrams and
flow charts to illustrate the steps in data reduction and phase
identification respec tively as well as  tables which show the effect of
errors. Descriptions of what lies behind commercial software  for finding
peak positions and identifying crystalline phases are helpful, particularly
for the occasions when the black box (on default settings) might not give
the correct answer.  <p>

 I believe that most of the information on diffractometer alignment has not
appeared before in a textbook. With the recent round-robin tests showing
that many diffractometers are not optimally aligned this is very timely,
particularly as the participants of such tests are likely to be more
conscientious than the many other non-participants. The disappointment in
this chapter is that the descriptions all relate to a family of Philips
diffractometers and it would have been good to cover a wider range of
instruments. The discussion of systematic aberrations and choice of slits is
instructive with more clear diagrams. Routine instrumental checks and the
use of standards also rarely appear in textbooks. They tend to be considered
by laboratories that concentrate on X-ray work or are seeking some sort of
accreditation and are unfortunately forgotten or never considered by others. 
For anyone trying to get the best out of a diffractometer and wanting to
have an understanding of possible errors, these chapters are most helpful. 
<p>

 As well as including new material, the book draws on recent and old
literature.  There are some historical descriptions which add interest
without obscuring the main aim of hel ping people to  do powder diffraction. 
The book is titled $Introduction$ and thus there is little or no mention of
profile analysis, texture measurements, glancing angle work, residual
strain, indexing, structure determination and the use of synchrotron or
neutron sources.  A companion volume is planned in which one expects that
such topics will be addressed.  <p> 

 If you have a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer which is being used for powder
diffraction, I recommend that you obtain a copy of this book.  <p>

Powder Diffraction: J. Ian Langford and Daniel LouÎr<br>
Rep. Prog. Phys, vol 59, No 2 (February 1996), pages 131 - 234.<br>
<p>
1997 will mark 30 years since the development of the Rietveld method which,
according to Langford and LouÎr, was one of the main factors responsible for
the renaissance of powder diffraction methods. The breadth and scope of this
review article clearly reflect the power and applicability of such
techniques today, in the characterisation of modern materials at the atomic
level. It is also apparent that this renaissance is far from complete;
future developments are likely to increase further the versatility and scope
of powder techniques. 
<p>
For the industrial crystallographer in particular, there was a previous
renaissance 30 years before Rietveld when the work of Hanawalt et al.
conceived the forerunner of the PDF. The topic of qualitative phase
identification is only one of many covered by Langford and LouÎr in their
review of developments in powder diffraction in recent times. 
<p>
The review is accessible to all users and researchers in powder diffraction
as the basic principles, aspects of instrumentation and experimental
considerations are well described, yet the authors lead us through to recent
state-of-the-art developments and applications. Of course, many of the key
advances in the technique in recent years are in those areas where the
authors themselves have played leading roles; namely in total pattern
fitting, line profile analysis, indexing and ab initio structure
determination. These are fully reviewed, starting with fundamental
principles and clearly describing how the contributions from various workers
have evolved into today's interpretative techniques. 

<p>  Although brief mention is made of synchrotron and neutron sources, the
theme of the review is the powder technique itself, irrespective of the
source used; this inevitably leads to a bias towards laboratory X-ray
examples, reflecting the volume of work in this area. 

<p>  Each section is illustrated by examples taken from key papers. For
example, the use of Rietveld refinement in structural studies on High Tc
superconductors. The discussion of line profile analysis is, not
surprisingly, thorough and includes the classic example of direction
dependant effects in ZnO. The treatment of ab initio structural studies is
fully up-to-date with mention of maximum entropy, simulated annealing,
lattice energy minimisation and anomalous dispersion approaches, among
others. The topics of non-ambient diffraction, dynamic diffraction and, in
particular, diffraction at high pressures make a welcome appearance and
include examples using conventional sources and neutrons as well as
synchrotron X-rays. 

<p>  A concise section on quantitative phase analysis includes conventional
methods as well as Rietveld-based approaches. This account is well
referenced and has a short account of applications. Indeed one of the main
purposes of a review such as this is to allow ready access to the key
publications in a particular area of work; the comprehensive set of
references appended to this article will satisfy anyone with this purpose in
mind.  The concluding section of the review summarises well the past
successes of powder diffraction and what were the key developments. Some
indication is also given of the future. This includes the increasing ease of
experimentation on individual grains of a polycrystalline sample leading to
a convergence of powder and single crystal methods. The future of the
technique in the characterisation of real materials does indeed seem secure.
