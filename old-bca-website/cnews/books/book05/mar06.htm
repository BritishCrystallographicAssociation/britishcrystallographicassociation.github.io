This seventeenth title in the series of IUCr Monographs on Crystallography
concerns the study of waxes, with particular emphasis on the structures of
pure <i>n</i>-alkyl compounds and their binary mixtures as models for
multicomponent systems containing linear polymethylene chains. The author‘s
own research in this field spans nearly 35 years, and his significant
contributions to the development of electron crystallography in particular
have provided many new insights into earlier powder X-ray diffraction and
spectroscopic studies of these systems. Electron diffraction images, mostly
taken from the author‘s own archives, are prominent throughout the book,
reflecting both the author‘s expertise and the importance of electron
crystallography in this area.<br><br>
 The back-cover synopsis of the book specifies that it aims to
elucidate three main features of waxes: ”firstly, which modifications of
molecular components are allowed for maintaining stable solid solutions;
secondly, what happens when stability conditions are traversed and
fractionation begins and thirdly, the structure of fractionated arrays•.

<p> The
opening chapter provides a more detailed statement of the book‘s scope,
citing a multitude of everyday products and industries that rely on a
thorough understanding of various waxes. One principal scientific objective
is noted to be a critical evaluation of this understanding, specifically of
the widely-accepted ”Le Roux model• for wax structure. In short, this model
suggests that a polydisperse wax — that is, a linear polymethylene chain
assembly that contains a distribution of chain lengths, chain unsaturation,
functionalisation and branching — can be considered to comprise four zones:
the first, a mostly crystalline region in which polymethylene chains are
arranged in a manner that resembles the pure materials; the second, a rigid
amorphous zone that incorporates chain branches; the third, an amorphous
region between the ends of the chains that may contain solvent molecules,
and the fourth, a more fluid region that contains volatile lower molecular
weight components. The book follows a course intended to assess this model
by examining the structures of various pure wax components and their binary
solid solutions in the most crystalline forms available.

Following the preliminary remarks, Chapter 1 comprises a concise and helpful
primer concerning aspects of polymorphism, phase diagrams and solid
solutions. X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction and differential scanning
calorimetry are featured techniques. Chapter 2 treats the general packing
features of linear polymethylene chains in the manner of Kitaigorodskii,
including characteristic electron diffraction patterns that assist with the
later discussion. Chapter 3 describes in some detail the known crystal
structures of the n-alkanes (paraffins), establishing the structural basis
for their extensive polymorphism. Inclusion in the discussion of recent
experimental data is a useful expansion on earlier accounts. This chapter
also touches upon branched and aromatically substituted paraffins, but
highlights that experimental knowledge in this area remains somewhat sparse.
Thermodynamic and structural aspects of disorder and phase transitions in
the pure paraffins is expanded upon in Chapter 4, which again incorporates a
good blend of crystallographic, spectroscopic and calorimetric data.

Chapters 5 and 6 provide a substantial discussion on binary paraffin
systems. In this section, Kitaigorodskii‘s well-cited rules for
stabilisation of solid solutions are evaluated against newly available
single-crystal electron diffraction data. While volumetric rules concerning
size and shape matching of the molecular components are found to be largely
robust, previous suggestions regarding the symmetries of the pure components
do not stand. Some fractionated binary structures are discussed, in which
phase separation is shown to involve both lateral and longitudinal chain
segregation — i.e. the structures do not simply comprise layers of the pure
components segregated at the methyl-group interfaces. The influence of
unsaturation and heteroatom substitution on general chain packing and on the
formation of binary phases is touched upon in Chapter 6, but experimental
information is currently less abundant in this area.

</p><p>
The following four chapters are devoted to functionalised derivatives of the
n-alkanes, considering respectively alcohols, carboxylic acids, fatty acid
esters and cholesteryl esters. Each survey encompasses the structural
features of the pure materials and also their binary solid solutions. These
chapters are valuable summaries of a large and very diverse literature, and
each is an excellent starting point for researchers wishing to consider the
solid-state behaviour of these classes of compounds.

</p><p>
In Chapter 11 the author brings together all of the information from the
preceding chapters, first providing an excellent summary, then discussing
how the knowledge can be applied to polydisperse waxes incorporating much
broader chain distributions. Specific examples are given in which structural
knowledge provides insight into the physical properties of polydisperse
waxes. Ultimately, Dorset arrives at the conclusion that growing
experimental evidence requires re-evaluation of the Le Roux model, then goes
on to suggest numerous areas for further progress.

</p><p>
As a whole, the book is impressive. The author brings together a huge amount
of literature to provide a coherent and comprehensive account of the
research area as it stands today. The pioneering research is faithfully
documented, but it is critically re-evaluated where more recent results
suggest this to be necessary. The range of analytical techniques discussed
imparts an appreciation of their complementarity for examining these
systems, while the focus on electron crystallography is justified and
clearly written by an expert. The overall presentation, including plentiful
diagrams and photographs, is excellent. The only possible negative comment
regarding this book is that it seems likely to find a rather limited
audience. Of the series of IUCr Monographs to date, the topic seems to be
the most esoteric, and despite the fact that the author makes an admirable
effort to stress its relevance in the opening remarks, it is perhaps
unlikely that the book will find its way into the general reading of many
crystallographers. Nonetheless, those who do venture into the book will be
richly rewarded — it is a worthy addition to the series.
