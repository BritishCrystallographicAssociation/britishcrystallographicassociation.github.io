For all those chemists whose understanding of the Jahn-Teller effect
involved explaining why 6-coordinate copper(II) complexes are never regular
octahedra, or why the U.V./visible spectra of octahedra l titanium(III)
complexes show a shoulder on the side of the main peak, this text is a real
eye opener.  It is certainly a book for the purists, but it  does cover
aspects of physics, chemistry and biology.  It treats the subject at a high
level, and employs quite a rigorous mathematical approach.<br><br>
 For the general reader Chapter 1 is very helpful, as in it the author
provides a general historical introduction to the subject; explains the
general principles, putting Jahn-Teller vibronic coupling effects in the
context of molecul ar and array structural science; and outlines the aims
and objectives of the book.

 In Chapter 2 the fundamental physics leading
to the development of the theory are explained, while in Chapter 3 the basic
formulations for different symmetry systems are discussed and the methods
used to deal with multicentre systems explained.  In Chapter 4
pseudo-Jahn-Teller, product Jahn-Teller and Renner-Teller (which deals with
linear molecules) effects are discussed.  In Chapter 5 the solutions to the
vibronic equations are described, as are the energy spectra showing dynamic
Jahn-Teller effects.  In Chapter 6 the general theory relating to electronic
spectra, infrared and Raman spectra and magnetic resonance spectra is
covered.  In Chapter 7 the geometry and spectra of molecular systems
ranging from diatomics up to pentaatomic MX<SUB>4</SUB> systems, and benzene
and cyclopentadienyl families, are discussed.  Finally, in Chapter 8,
Jahn-Teller effects in solid-state systems are described.

This is probably not a book that a crystallographer would sit down and read
cover-to-cover but for the general reader this book is certainly useful as a
reference volume, and for experts in the area the text would be a useful
addition to a library.  The material is very well and clearly presented, and
it is apparent that the text has been written by an expert in the field. 
There are references at the end of each chapter which provides a useful
source of the original literature and provides a source for further reading.
