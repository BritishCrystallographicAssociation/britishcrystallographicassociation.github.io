<h3>The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC):<br>
40 years of database development, software and research</h3>
</center>
</p>
<P>
<h4>Beginnings</h4>

The CCDC was created to record crystal structures, and the Cambridge
Structural Database, CSD, was one of the first numerical databases created
anywhere in the world.  The CCDC originated from a small group set up in
1959 by J D Bernal and Olga Kennard, initially at Birkbeck College, London
and from 1962 at the Chemistry Department in Cambridge, collecting  data on
organic and metal-organic crystal structures and using these to investigate
intermolecular arrangements and forces. In January 1965 David  Watson joined
the group and later that year the CCDC was formally established with a grant
from the Office for Scientific and Technical Information. The collection of
data was greatly accelerated and both numeric and bibliographic data were
transferred from edge punched cards to "machine readable" form. Subsequent
CSD growth statistics suggest that, had this work started later, it is
doubtful if it would have started at all. But it did, and 40 years later the
CSD contains 335,276 structures.

<h4>Development</h4>

By modern standards, early progress was horribly slow:  computer technology
was in its mainframe, card chewing, batch-processing era, and hardware was
temperamental.  On the human level, staff were needed to acquire, log and
encode data, and crystallographer-programmers were needed to turn the vision
into a reality.  Scientific abstractors and data entry personnel, most of
whom worked from home, were also vital early colleagues on the developing
production line.  The CCDC itself was partly a hub which managed a complex
data preparation network, and partly a scientific analysis centre that
processed the raw material into a growing database.  Data acquisition itself
has now completed its own transformation from the days when all coordinates
were printed to the current nirvana of electronic deposition via the CIF. 
In between we had to cope with the myriad vagaries of hard-copy depositions,
which even involved some in handwritten form! </p>

<P>
An early need was for structure validation software, to guard against local
data entry mistakes and to locate the errors that occurred in some 10% of
typed or typeset tables. Many errors were trivial to correct, but in the
pre-email era a significant number had to be referred back to authors by
letter.  Crystallographers took these 'CCDC letters' in good part, and this
was the beginning of a special relationship with the community that has
enhanced the development of the CSD throughout the past 40 years.</p> 

<P>
An electronic bibliographic file was being regularly updated by 1970, and
was disseminated via the <I>Molecular Structures and Dimensions</I> book
series - itself one of the earliest handbooks to be typeset directly by
computer.  Meanwhile, the first 5,000 crystal structures were being
validated and entered into a CSD data file.   Finally, it was realised that
a system of chemical structure representation was needed and a third
component, a file of chemical connection tables, was created. 2D and 3D
substructure search capabilities were now possible, adding tremendous value
to the underlying crystal structure information.  These three separate files
were eventually amalgamated into the CSD that we know today. </p>

<P>
<h4>Millions of lines of code</h4>

Software development has always been at the heart of CCDC activities, and we
have run the gamut from FORTRAN II to our current object-oriented C++
environment.  FORTRAN, as its name implies, was never really created for
text processing, and we pushed the available compilers to their limit and
beyond in the early days.</p> 

<P>
The CCDC is responsible for three types of code:<br>
<ul>
  <li> that which underpins CSD creation, 
  <li>that which forms part of the CSD System for search, analysis and
structure visualisation, 
  <li>and applications software that uses crystal
structure data to solve problems in structural chemistry and biology. 
</ul>
  CCDC software developers have blended the 3D representations of
crystallography with the 2D representations of chemical informatics, and
have been at the forefront in creating novel systems for 3D substructure
searching, including searches for intermolecular interactions, and the
statistical analysis and visualisation of parameter distributions retrieved
from the CSD.  More recently, we have generated knowledge-based libraries of
structural information, and have diversified (often collaboratively) into
software applications that use crystal structure information.</p>

<P>
<h4>CSD System releases</h4>

By the mid-1970s, the first version of the CSD System had been released to
academics in the UK, USA, Japan and Italy.  Many other countries formed
National Affiliated Centres and became subscribers to the service.  The
pharmaceutical and agrochemicals industries began to experiment with
computational chemistry and modelling tools for rational molecular design,
and the number of industrial subscribers began to rise during the 1980s. 
Early releases were on magnetic tape, and the number of 1600 foot tapes per
release was certainly a challenge for the average postman, particularly the
one who 'delivered' several CCDC parcels to a hedge 'somewhere in Europe'. 
Software was released as source code, to be compiled under the user's local
operating system.  Today all that has changed, with the universality of just
a few operating systems, CDs and internet downloads, click-of-a-button
installers, and e-mail support desks.  
 

<P>
<h4>1,200 Applications Papers</h4>

The first papers that made use of the CSD for fundamental research began to
appear in the late 1970s, inspired by the work of Hans-Beat Buergi and Jack
Dunitz on structure correlation.  Recognising the CSD as a growing library
of geometric structures, there was a rapid acceleration in this type of
research from about 1980.  A key issue was to improve database searching and
develop a proper statistical basis for data analysis, so that improvements
in distributed software were often driven by current research needs.</p>   

<P>
The CCDC itself has been heavily involved in this research effort, and has
published applications papers covering both intramolecular and
intermolecular topics.  Tables of mean bond lengths published in
<I>J.Chem.Soc, Perkin Trans</I> (1987, pp S1-S19) and <I>J.Chem.Soc. Dalton
Trans.</I> (1989, ppS1-S83) have now jointly received more than 10,000
citations.  In the study of intermolecular interactions, the CSD has
underpinned many fundamental contributions. These have helped to provide
tools for studying protein-ligand interactions, and played a part in the
emergence of crystal engineering as a sub-discipline. The CCDC's most cited
paper in this area - more than 1,000 citations and the 60<SUP>th</SUP> most
cited paper ever in the first 125 years of  JACS -  is the categorisation of
short C-H...O interactions as true H-bonds (Taylor &amp; Kennard, <I>J.
Amer. Chem. Soc</I>., <B>104</B>, 5063-70, 1982), work that re-shaped the
global view of weaker interactions. </p>

<P>
The CCDC maintains a web-accessible database of published applications of
its products, and the 1,200 current entries chart the many and varied uses
of the CSD.  The CCDC is well represented with over 150 papers, but more
than 1,000 other references show the truly international impact of CSD-based
research. </p>

<P>
<h4>The CSD at 40</h4>

On 1 January 2005, the CSD contained 335,276 crystal structures and grew by
nearly 29,000 structures in 2004.  The size and complexity of structures has
also increased steadily with time.  The CCDC has excellent relationships
with journals, and 84 titles now require electronic data deposition to the
CCDC when a paper is submitted.  These data enter the CSD when the paper is
published, and the CCDC now maintains a growing parallel archive of more
than 160,000 of the initial 'raw' CIFs. </p>

<P>
Current CSD statistics are also available on the website, and although the
CCDC encourages direct deposition of Private Communications, these
statistics refer primarily to published data.  The issue of the very large
number of structures that languish unpublished in laboratory records is
quite another matter, but one that must surely be addressed.  Software for
data processing and maintenance of both the CIF archive and the CSD are
currently undergoing a major overhaul, and new software will incorporate
much expert knowledge that has been gained over the past 40 years.</p> 

<P>
<h4>New Products</h4>

Two new components of the CSD System have been added since 1997.  These are
knowledge-based libraries of intramolecular geometry (Mogul) and
intermolecular interactions (IsoStar).  They provide click-of-a-button
access to millions of individual pieces of geometrical and chemical
information that can be derived from the CSD (and PDB protein-ligand
complexes in the case of IsoStar).  Further development, and integration of
this structural knowledge with other software, is ongoing in both cases.</p>

<P>
Recent years have also seen the CCDC diversify into developing and marketing
specific software applications for rational drug design (GOLD, SuperStar,
Relibase+) and for structure solution from powder diffraction data (DASH). 
All of these products make use of crystal structure data from the CSD or PDB
in some way, and all except SuperStar are being developed through
collaborations with industry and academia.  The life sciences products,
concentrating essentially on protein-ligand interactions and protein-ligand
docking, help to solve difficult problems, and promote the value of
small-molecule crystal structure data in structural biology and in the
pharmaceutical and agrochemicals industries.  The CCDC continues to broaden
its horizons, by seeking new areas of science in which crystal structure
data adds value to research and development activities.</p>

<P>
<h4>The CCDC as an Independent Institution</h4>
<P>
The CCDC was grant-funded from 1965 until 1989, when it became an
independent institution: a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee and with
charitable status.  This means that the CCDC must be financially
self-sufficient, and that any surplus income must be ploughed back into the
company (e.g. for new equipment) or into specific charitable activities. 
Thus, the CCDC provides grants-in-aid for access to the CSD System in
developing countries, sponsorship to students who are working on projects
allied to the CCDC's interests, and support for the activities of relevant
professional organisations.   The CCDC's affairs are overseen by an
international Board of Governors, eight eminent scientists who, in their
turn, are responsible to UK Companies House and to the Charity Commissioners
for England and Wales. </p>

<P>
<h4>Our most valuable assets: Staff, Customers and Collaborators</h4>
<P>
The CCDC has expanded steadily, and now has 50 employees divided between
database creation, product development, research, scientific and technical
support, and administration. The CCDC now has customers in academia and
industry all over the world, and the nearly 2,000 CSD System licenses were
distributed across 56 countries in 2004.  The CCDC has a long history of
scientific collaboration with academia and industry, and this work has
fuelled our research output and fed into our product developments. 
Currently, the Pfizer Institute for Pharmaceuticals Materials Research, a
major partnership involving the CCDC, Cambridge University and Pfizer Inc.,
is generating exciting results and further extending our areas of scientific
interest. </p> 

<P>
We do not have a precise total of the number of staff and visitors who have
worked at the CCDC over the past 40 years, but it must be 250 or more.  What
we do know is that they have left, or are leaving, their own mark on the
organisation.  It is the stronger for their contributions.  Customers,
scientific collaborators and data depositors also leave their mark, through
their constructive input and feedback on our efforts.  The CSD, our
products, and ultimately all of our customers, have benefited enormously
from these interactions, and we are grateful for their involvement.</p>  

<P>
We look forward to the next 40 years.
