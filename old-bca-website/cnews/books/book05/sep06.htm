John Desmond Bernal was a remarkable man; born in Ireland in 1901 he spent
most of his life in England where he died in 1971.  He had an attractive
personality and an insatiable curiosity; unlike most people he could recall
information and talk knowledgeably on many topics, which caused his
colleagues to refer to him as  <I>"Sage"</I> since his undergraduate days.
His wide interests in science, politics and the arts make him a very
difficult subject for a biographer.<br><br>
Dorothy Hodgkin took ten years to write his 'Biographical memoir' (see Ref 1
below) for the Royal Society. A contemporary of his, the novelist 
C.P.Snow, wrote a novel,<I> "The Search"  </I>in 1934, where one of the main
characters  is an X-Ray crystallographer with many resemblances to Bernal.
Brenda Swann  and Francis Aprahamian  edited  a collection of essays mainly
on his life in politics  published in 1999 (see Ref 2 below).

Andrew Brown, an English radiation oncologist practising in New Hampshire,
has been working on this biography for the last five years and has
interviewed many eminent scientists and others who knew Bernal. The result
is this massive work, weighing 1 Kg, where he  describes both the political
activities in Europe and the science being carried out at the time to set
the scene in which Bernal found himself.  For example,  the work of the
Braggs leading to their Nobel Prize in 1915 is described because W.H.Bragg
was about to become the Director of the Royal Institution just before Bernal
went to work there after graduation in 1923. He spent a lot of time in his
final undergraduate year working on a  paper in which he derived the
analytical theory of point systems, as a result he failed to get a first and
so could not be accepted as a doctorate student at Cambridge. This was one
of his characteristics, getting sidetracked on other projects rather than
concentrate on the one which others may have thought most important, and
also in those projects deriving things  written up more thoroughly later by
others.  Later he suggested  problems for his students, five of whom won
Nobel prizes.

<P>
 The book is ordered chronologically, divided into 22 chapters  and a
Postscript, each with extensive footnotes, on average about 70 per chapter.
The footnotes might have been better printed at the end of each chapter
instead of all being collected together at the end of the book.  The
chapters themselves have names and numbers but the footnotes sections only
numbers which makes them hard to find when  one finger  is keeping your
place in the chapter, the other fingers are trying to hold several hundred
pages together while with the other hand  you are trying to find which
section of Notes to read.  
</p>
<P>
There is only one diagram which seems strange when crystallographers think
in three dimensions and descriptions of biological molecules in words take
longer to understand. I have not met 'Bernal Charts' and would have liked to
see a diagram of one.
</p>
<P>
Other things lacking are a complete bibliography of all his works, though
you can probably construct one from the Notes, and a brief summary of the
important events in his life.

</p>
<P>
There are 27 photographs, which appear to be an afterthought as I could not
find any reference to them in the body of the text. They cover a period of
time between about 1900, photographs of his parents, to 1962, Bernal
listening to Krushchev addressing a World Congress on Disarmament on Peace
in Moscow.

<P>
There is much new detail in this book, for example, about his mother,
'Bessie' Bernal.  He was her first child and she taught him to talk in
French and English, answered his endless questions and encouraged his
interest in travel by taking him across the Atlantic by sea and on across
the continent by train to visit his American relatives as a child of 3. 
</p>
<P>
Bessie was the daughter of the Reverend William Young Miller, a Presbyterian
Minister from New England, who had married her mother Elizabeth in Illinois.
When he retired in 1883 he moved to San Jose, California not far from
Stanford University which Bessie attended to study languages.  Her influence
may explain why Bernal was willing to give women a chance to work on
crystallography in his Birkbeck laboratory, an unusual occurrence in those
days just after World War II.
</p>
<P>
In his youth he was a devout Catholic and when he lost his faith almost
immediately he found Communism  which he treated with religious fervour
being reluctant to see evil in any Soviet actions,  In chapter 6, 'Soviet
Pilgrims', we learn he went to Leningrad on a lecture tour with Margaret
Gardiner at the time of Kirov's assassination but dismissed the rumour that
Stalin had ordered the killing as 'malicious gossip'.
</p>
<P>
Bernal lived through most of the turmoil of the 20th century.  He travelled
from Ireland to school in England at the time of the Easter rebellion in
1916,  survived influenza in the pandemic of 1918,  lived through the
Depression of the 1930s, lived a Bohemian life style between the Wars in an
unconventional marriage where both partners took lovers; his 4 children had
3 different mothers. He worked with Lord Mountbatten during World War II on
the planning for the D-Day landings and worked tirelessly for peace.  Andrew
Brown gives extensive background information on all of these events but
there is not space to summarise them here.   
</p>
<P>
Buy the book for yourself and read the chapters on the early history of
molecular biology, the Physics of Life and the difficulties of doing
crystallography without access to modern computers so your calculations have
to be done using 7-figure log tables.
