<p>
John Desmond Bernal, crystallographer, molecular physicist, social
scientist, Communist visionary and peace campaigner was born in Ireland on
10 May 1901. Although he lived most of his life in England, apparently he
always regarded himself as an Irishman, despite the Bernal family being
Sephardic Jews who had reached Ireland only in 1840 from Spain via Amsterdam
and London. His life was affected by many notable events of the twentieth
century, including the Russian Revolution of 1917, which inspired many
Cambridge intellectuals of the 1930s, including Bernal, to become Communists
and the Second World War, which came at a time when he must have been at the
peak of his intellectual powers. This volume consists of 13 separate essays
on various aspects of his life written by those who knew him personally,
many of whom have died in the years since this book was first planned. As
Eric Hobsbawm remarks in the preface, "Bernal was fascinating, memorable and
extraordinarily impressive". He inspired others; several of his pupils
became Nobel Laureates, but he himself did not, perhaps because his wide
interests prevented him from the single minded devotion to science which is
characteristic of most great scientists.</p>

<P>
Although it is almost 30 years since he died, no-one has yet written the
major biography which Hobsbawm thinks is undoubtedly Bernal's due, and this
volume is not it. These essays do not form a complete life story, some
aspects are not covered at all, such as his sexual affairs, and science is
only covered in one chapter. There is a Calendar of Events in his life,
including the dates of birth of his four children. The authors are such
diverse people as Anne Synge (Early Years and Influences), Peter Trent (The
Scientist), Chris Freeman (The Social Function of Science), Ritchie Calder
(Bernal at War), Lord Mountbatten of Burma (Memories of Desmond Bernal), and
Ivor Montagu (The Peacemonger).  A useful page of 'Initials and Acronyms' at
the beginning gives the meaning of abbreviations in common use during the
1940s up to the 1970s. At the end, the 'Biographical notes on the Editors
and Contributors' is essential for those who have not heard of the authors.
There are extensive <em>'Notes'</em> on most chapters, but the quality of
the writing is variable; I found  Bernal's own description of the D-Day
Landings fascinating but some of the more political essays much harder to
read. He was a prolific writer; only his non-scientific books are listed
here, the first was <em>'The World, the Flesh and the Devil'</em> published
in 1929, the last <em>'The Extension of Man'</em> published posthumously in
1972.

<P>
Notes on the dust jacket of the book record that<em> "in a field notorious
for its mysogynism, Bernal's laboratories at Birkbeck were a haven for many
of the leading women scientists of the day including Rosalind Franklin".
</em> The back of the dust jacket shows his interest in Art; it has a
reproduction of the 'Bernal Picasso', which was painted on the wall of
Bernal's flat on the upper floor of the houses at 21/22 Torrington Square,
the first home of the Birkbeck Crystallography Department which he founded.

<P>
Should you rush out and buy this book?  Not if you expect to learn a lot
about his science;  only if you are interested in how one scientist was
concerned for the social consequences of his research and despite his war
time efforts, later spent much energy on promoting peace throughout the
world.

<h3> Review by Alan Mackay</h3>
<p>
Desmond Bernal was a visionary scientist, one of the principal creators of
molecular biology and the author of a key book "The Social Function of
Science". He died in 1971, and thus memories are fading, so why should we
still be vitally concerned with his work? With this Collection of a dozen
essays about his life by people who actually knew him, we get a last chance
to hear what he was like.
</p>
<p>
We should be concerned because, due to the activities of states and
companies, science is now presented as dangerous in itself and scientists
are stigmatised for the results of the policies of politicians and
businessmen The very nature of science in our Societies has been questioned
by post-modernists as, for example, physics and genetics have become so
difficult that few can be educated to sufficient standards. The quantum
world of the microcosmos and the giant-scale world of cosmology are not like
the limited world of the tables and chairs of the philosophers. Common sense
derived at the scale of our everyday lives is not good enough. Bernal
showed, at many levels, what science could do for society. Science itself is
neutral: its applications are social and political.
</p>
<p>
Bernal spent himself on the political struggle against nuclear war and we
should still be concerned with his efforts and arguments because this danger
increases and, for example, George W. Bush, the main Republican contender
for the US Presidency, has "made an anti-ballistic system the centrepiece of
a plan 'to redefine war on our terms'" using new technologies yet to be
developed. Enemies of the USA will be restrained by force rather than by
being made fat through prosperity. Just as the common land was enclosed
during the l8th and l9th centuries and became private property, so now the
information generated by scientific research, about the genes which
determine the properties of all living matter. is becoming private property.
The "terminator gene" affair has alerted public concern. Although since 1945
democracy has perceptibly increased in nation states, power has slipped away
from nation states to multi-national companies, which are not
democratically guided at all and which try to push nation states about. The
command economy, which modern economists of the Chicago school so deride in
the fallen USSR, is just the way in which companies operate. Technology
based on science has irreversibly changed the world at great speed.
</p>
<p>
We live on the hinge of world history and in the next generation
civilisation may turn up or down. Bernal was also concerned with the use of
science in war. His activities in the 1930s in the Cambridge Scientists'
Anti-War group are described here in more detail than before and his
expertise became so notable that, despite Bernal's communist position, he
was taken into the government war effort, first for assessing air-raid
precautions and later, as a direct scientific advisor to Mountbatten, to the
planning for the invasion of France. To see what science could do when
applied, almost cost-regardless, for war, led Bernal to push tirelessly for
its application to a world without war.
</p>
<p>
We should be concerned because the role of science and of scientists in our
present-day society is still equivocal. As never before people are ignorant
of the technology which Supports them. In the Victorian period, sustained by
such treatises as the "Catechism of the Steam Engine" published by the
Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, basic technology was
within reach of most people, but now it has receded as science has become
more complicated. Bernal's post-war book "Science in History" presented a
broad perspective of how various societies had dealt with science.
</p>
<p>
Bernal's own career broadened the very word "crystallographer" to come to
indicate the profession of a scientist who, although primarily skilled in
the discovery of the arrangements of atoms in crystals, concerned himself or
notably herself, for his student, Dorothy Hodgkin, winner of a Nobel prize,
most clearly exemplified the calling, with the application of science to
improving the human condition. In the historical development of science
Bernal has a leading place, not so much for what he actually did, as for
pointing out what could and should be done. For example, he found that, if
treated correctly, a protein crystal could retain its order during
irradiation by X-rays and that the information in the scattered beams of
X-rays meant that the protein molecules had exact structures, with every
atom in a proper place. His students went on to solve the key structures of
haemoglobin and other key materials. Proteins were no longer to be regarded
as part of the formless protoplasm and molecular biology could begin in
earnest. This application of physical methods would revolutionise our
understanding of biology and the origin of life on Earth. Bernal himself had
so many concerns that he could not devote himself totally to a single key
problem with the intensity necessary for a Nobel prize.
</p>
<p>
In 1937, on the eve of the second world war Bernal was elected in to
Fellowship of the Royal Society, a formal recognition of his scientific
work, but at much the same time (l939) his book "The Social Function of
Science", subtitled "What science does and what science could do" appeared,
just in time for many continental scientists to read it in captivity or
under the occupation. He was also in l937 appointed to the professorial
chair in physics at Birkbeck College (University of London) which he
occupied for the remainder of his life.
</p>
<p>
Thus, by the outbreak of the war Bernal had established reputations, both in
actual science and in the economics, politics and consequences ofscience. In
a way he followed the programme of Lucretius, to explain how atoms as
primeval particles could explain the "nature of things", and who sought "to
loose the mind from the knots of religion". As a child he had been imprinted
with the Catholic religion and with difficulty, described in this book,
managed to free himself from that incubus.
</p>
<p>
Already by l939, Bernal had concerned himself with some of the main issues
of our time: the creation of molecular biology; the origin of life;
armaments and science for war; the flow of scientific information (the
latter as evinced, for example, in his central role in the Royal Society
meeting on scientific information held in 1948). He had also made
significant contributions to the arts, literature and history. Since he was
attached to Mountbatten's staff as scientific advisor he played a key part
in the application of science to military operations and, in particular, was
able to learn what science and technology could actually do when supported
whole heartedly by the state.
</p>
<p>
This book, some 25 years in the making, has eventually appeared, bringing a
great deal of fascinating material relating mainly to the socio-political 
activities and to biography. There is much new material relating to his
background in Ireland, to his education and to his political development.
Eric Hobsbawm in the preface explains why this book "can help to rescue an
astonishing figure from the mist of semi-oblivion" and in a separate chapter
describes the struggle in Birkbeck College which eventually precipitated
Bernal's first disabling stroke in July 1963 at the age of only 62. In the
most critical period of our lifetime, the Cuban missile crisis of October
1962, Bernal had also to deal with a local attempt to close down the
crystallographic laboratory. Bernal never had lavish facilities and had to
struggle to maintain those which he possessed. For example, his most quoted
work, on the fundamentals of the structure of liquids, especially water, was
done with very few people and poor resources, but is now altogether
incorporated in the general understanding of the liquid state.
</p>
<p>
30 years on, Bernal's scientific contributions are now deeply embedded into
the very fabric of science, and thus it is those who stand on his shoulders
who are now cited, just as few people read or quote the original papers of
Einstein. His political activities now fall more into perspective as taking
place at a time where communist society could be seen as a viable
alternative to global capitalism. Now no alternative economic system is in
sight and the only possibility is amelioration of the existing system.
Bernal was very conscious of what could be called "the laser effect". A
laser and a candle may consume the same energy but in a laser all the waves
add in synchronism. If many people moved simultaneously in the same
direction they could accomplish anything (as football crowds realise to
their cost).
</p>
<p>
The book informs us more fully about Bernal's relationships with the Soviet
Union, the planned application of science in society and the conflicts. For
example, having met N. I. Bukharin in the l930s, Bernal was in a position,
after Bukharin's execution, gradually to feed the constructive ideas of the
immediate post-revolutionary Russia back into Soviet discussion. On a more
domestic scale there is a fascinating account of Bernal's work in the world
of architecture, art and building with much new information.
</p>
<p>
At the memorial meeting, Shortly after Bernal's death, C.P.Snow said that a
full biography should not be written for some decade until things had fallen
into perspective. Unwittingly this has happened and these contributions to a
biography will stand for the next decade or so when, with the passage of
time nobody will remain who had the pleasure and excitement of contact with
this most engaging and complex personality, as did the contributors to the
present volume.</p>
<p>
Above all, Bernal was a seer, perhaps with selective vision of Utopia, but
with vision none the less.</p>
