<I>Crystal Growth Technology</I> is a commendable addition to the extensive
literature of crystal growth because it aims to cover techniques and
processes in current use for the production of industrially important
crystals. Single crystals are the foundations of modern industry but,
despite their enormous economic importance, details of production processes
are sparsely represented in conferences or in the literature. (It should be
noted that the first international school on crystal growth technology as a
specific topic was not held until 1998). The editors of the book, K.Byrappa
and T. Ohachi, are distinguished workers in the world of crystal growth,
Byrappa in hydrothermal  growth and Ohachi in molecular beam epitaxy. The
book has seventeen chapters, only two of which (Chapters 2 &amp; 8) are
exclusively theoretical, each being a review of some topic related to the
production of industrially and biologically important crystals.

<P>
Reviewing a book compiled from contributions by a number of authors requires
two interlinked approaches, one of which, in common with any other review,
is an assessment of the success of the book in meeting the specification
implied by its title, the other being the discussion of the merits of
individual contributions. In case of the present book, individual chapters
can hardly be faulted. Indeed, it is unusual for all the contributions in
such a compilation to be of such a uniformly high standard and the editors
are to be congratulated. An analysis of every chapter would make this review
intolerably long but a few have been selected for more detailed discussion.
</p>

<P>
Ichiro Sunagawa's subject  (Chap.1), morphological features of mineral
crystals, may seem a surprising choice for inclusion in this book but the
author's extensive knowledge and deep understanding of crystal growth have
resulted in a stimulating essay on the significance of morphological
features, which, despite the examples being restricted to beryl, diamond and
ruby, is of  much more general significance, and should be important even to
workers studying the growth of crystals in a biological environment.</p>

<P>
Irisawa's contribution (Chap.2) on the theory of crystal growth from vapour
and solution is a competent treatment of basic theory starting from the
concept of thermodynamic driving force and the surface models of Kossel and
Stranski. The treatment is extended to growth from solution and incorporates
the necessary modifications of the theory to cope with solvation effects.
The chapter is well presented but is essentially introductory and covers
only long-established theory. I feel that most potential readers of this
book will be already familiar with theory at this level or, at least, have
access to more comprehensive and recent work.</p>

<P>
Molecular beam epitaxy  (MBE) has evolved from being a powerful research
tool into a technique for the production of specialised nanostructures in
III-V compounds and the parallel development of vapour-phase epitaxy using
organometallic compounds (MOVPE) has resulted in important new optical and
electronic devices. The chapter by T. Nishinaga and S. Naritsuka  (Chap.3)
provides a compact review of both these processes and emphasises the fact
that the purity level achieved by MOCVD is not inferior to that obtained by
MBE. The chapter is divided approximately into three, the first two parts
covering MBE and MOCVD and comparing their chemistry and elementary growth
processes. The final part describes the production of nanostructures such as
quantum well wires (QWW) and quantum dots. This part also covers highly
mismatched heterogeneous interfaces and the production of GaN lasers by
microchannel epitaxy.</p>

<P>
The chapters on diamond synthesis (4), silicon carbide (6 &amp; 7) and
quartz (11) strike an excellent balance between basic science and practical
details. All these chapters have extensive lists of valuable references.</a>

<P>
Chapter 16 is an admirably detailed review of the growth of hydroxyapatite
crystals related to biomaterials. Calcium orthophosphates, particularly
hydroxyapatite, occupy an important place in many biological and medical
topics: they are associated with pathological calcifications such as dental
plaque, urinary calculi and artherosclerosis; they form the foundations of
bone and tooth structures and they find use as orthopaedic and dental
cements. The authors, Atsuo Ito and Kazuo Onuma, introduce the calcium
orthophosphate family and discuss the prevention of undesirable
calcification at the surface of implanted biomaterials, the composition and
properties of phoshate cements and the various factors influencing the
formation of hydroxyapatite in hard tissue. These diverse processes are
shown to depend entirely upon the crystal growth kinetics of hydroxyapatite.
This chapter provides an extremely informative review and, with its 196
references, is an approachable and comprehensive introduction to this
important and growing field.</a>

<P>
The last chapter (17) is devoted to the growth of gemstones and is a good
general review of the subject but does not present much new information and
would have been more appropriate in a gemmological publication. In view of
the two outstanding chapters on silicon carbide already referred to, it
seems strange that this chapter makes no mention of recent work on the
important SiC gemstone, moissanite. (See, for example, K. Nassau, J.
Gemmology, vol. 26 [7)] 1999).</p>

<P>
The chapters not individually discussed cover the following topics:
laser-assisted growth of PZT films, multicomponent perovskites, borate
crystals for non-linear optics, hydrothermal growth of rare-earth vanadates,
lithium niobate &amp; bismuth germanate, high-temperature superconductors
and zinc chalcogenides. </P>
 
<P>
Considered as a whole, the book is successful in presenting compact and
well-written pieces on selected topics. However, it does suffer from the
omission of some extremely important subjects, for example, silicon,
scintillators, habit control in bulk crystallization, corundum, large-scale
growth from aqueous solution, and organic compounds. While no book can be
fully comprehensive, I feel that, if some of these gaps had been filled, it
would have been a more satisfactory piece of work. The aims of the book
would have been achieved to a greater extent also if the amount of
background science had been reduced and more emphasis given to contemporary
production methods. Some of the chapters, although of good quality, might
have appeared in any conventional book on crystal growth with no claim to a
particular emphasis on technology or production.</p>

<P>
This book would certainly be a desirable addition to a library but, with the
price set at &pound;105, it cannot be seriously recommended to individual
purchasers.</p>

<P>
As a result of reading this book - although this is not intended as a
criticism - I have been reflecting on the current use of the word technology
and would like to make a plea for some restraint. The word technology meant
originally the study of science applied to industry but in the last 20 years
or so it has been battered almost out of recognition. Politicians,
journalists and other scientific illiterates tend to use the word when they
refer to anything involving computers, while the scientific community use it
indiscriminately as a fashionable blanket term so that they can avoid making
the small effort needed to decide whether they mean method, technique,
process, equipment or procedure. Perhaps we should all hesitate the next
time we are tempted to say or write anything about technology.</p>

<P>
I've sometimes wondered whether infiltrating children's playgroups with
building blocks of all seven crystal systems would build a nation of
crystallographers. It would certainly seem from reading this book, that
early Froebel training in spatial awareness strongly influenced Frank Lloyd
Wright (1867-1959) and many other notable architects, artists and thinkers:
including Le Corbusier, Paul Klee, Piet Mondrian, Maurits Escher and even
Albert Einstein.</p>

<P>
Interestingly, the author is an emeritus professor of music, who lives in a
house specially designed for her by Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW). FLW's mother
apparently discovered Friedrich Froebel's system of education when she
visited the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876. His father (William
Russell Cary Wright) was superintendent of schools in Richmond County,
Wisconsin as well as an accomplished musician, who felt that music was the
closest art to architecture, in form, structure and ornamentation. FLW's
early years were spent listening to his father playing Beethoven on the
piano and playing with Froebel 'gifts' provided by his mother.

<P>
Friedrich Froebel's life of educating (1782-1852) overlaps with that of
Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and comes a century before Maria Montessori
(1870-1952). His system gave the elementary geometrical basis for design and
awakened the child mind to 'rhythmic structure' in Nature by the use of
constructive playthings (the 'gifts') presented in a specified order. It
seems very likely that Froebel's interest in geometrical ideas was
reinforced when he became Assistant at the Mineralogical Museum of Berlin,
working under the guidance of Christian Samuel Weiss (1780-1856) - the Weiss
of the zone law. He was later (1816) offered the professorship of mineralogy
at Stockholm University, an invitation which he appears not to have taken
up; but his nephew, Julius Froebel, did become Professor of Mineralogy at
Z&uuml;rich.</p>

<P>
The Froebel education scheme consisted of the 'gifts' - cubes, spheres,
cylinders, cones and many other things - together with the 'system'. The
latter embraced the Froebel laws of unity, contrasts, development and
connections. Nature observes natural laws when creating, so humankind should
also follow them in creative endeavours.

</p>
<P>
The longest chapter (of over a hundred pages) gives details of all the
'gifts' and the possible connections with FLW's architecture and with
geometric crystallography. Several examples are given of four-fold
rotational symmetry exhibited by FLW ground plans. There are clear
similarities between the nets/meshes drawn on the Froebel table and
two-dimensional crystallography. The solid shapes of the cone, cube and
sphere were considered by C&eacute;zanne to be basic to all others. To these
basic shapes, Le Corbusier added the cylinder and FLW the tetrahedron. There
are parallels between illustrations in Owen Jones's famous architectural
textbook <I>The Grammar of Ornament</I> (1856) and the symmetry groups of
crystallography. Arrangements of Froebel's bi-coloured tablets find complete
expression in the dichromatic space groups of Shubnikov and Koptsik (1972).

<P>
Although R Buckminster Fuller attended kindergarten, it is not entirely
clear whether he was Froebel trained. He was once introduced by FLW as 'a
scientist interested in architecture', whereas FLW described himself as 'an
architect interested in science'. Fuller apparently was visually handicapped
to the point of being legally blind from birth: before being fitted with
spectacles he had gained his three-dimensional insight through tactile
awareness. Certainly he had a great gift for designing structures from
tetrahedra and octahedra, and huge polyhedral domes.</p>

<P>
I cannot say that this is essential reading for every crystallographer, but
if anyone wishes to pursue the connection between early kindergarten
training and eventual profession, this book provides many of the clues. It
is a scholarly work, with over 150 references, 360 notes and a good index;
and it contains many interesting historical anecdotes tracing the influence
which members of the various connected families in the USA, Germany, Italy
and Switzerland had upon educational reform.</p>

</p>
<P>
Volume E is the fifth of the "New" International Tables to appear.  It
covers subperiodic groups, that is, those which are periodic in one or two
dimensions and finite in the others. It is composed much in the style of
Volume A, with large, clear diagrams, and most of the same tables, including
general and special positions, projections and sub- and supergroups.  While
it will certainly not command the market that Volume A does, it is almost
certainly of greater relevance that it may seem to the average
crystallographer, as so many structures may be considered as built up from
substructures having the symmetries described here.
</p>
<P>
After an introductory chapter, the first symmetry groups covered are the 2
oblique and the 5 rectangular frieze groups (2-dimensional overall, periodic
in one dimension). As these relate to the 17 plane groups, they provide a
good introduction to the much more complex  rod and layer symmetries which
relate to three dimensional objects.
</p>
<P>
The next section gives the 75 rod groups (3-dimensional overall, periodic in
one direction.) Unlike friezes, rods may have an axis of any dimension along
the rod, and the authors necessarily include only those which can arise from
crystallographic symmetry. Diagrams for the higher symmetry rods show the
projection along the rod axis only, while the 22 groups deriving from
orthorhombic or lower symmetry show the three projections.  Oddly, the
projection along the rod is invariably shown as a circle, although an
ellipse would seem more suitable, as such rods do not require circular
cross-sections.
</p>
<P>
The third set of groups, the 80 layer groups, are 3-dimensional overall and
periodic in two of these. In these diagrams, only the projection along the
non-periodic direction is given.
</p>
<P>
The final section of the book gives <I>scanning tables</I>, where scanning
is defined as description of the spatial distribution of local symmetries.
In this case, those of interest are the <I>penetration rod groups</I> and
the <I>sectional layer groups.</I>  Well laid-out scanning tables are given
for each of the 230 space groups, and the various sectional layer groups are
given explicitly. However, the "distribution of the penetration rod groups
is seen directly from the <I>scanning groups</I>" and this is less
convenient, as the order and naming of some elements has to be changed.
</p>
<P>
Examples are given of the uses of the groups, particularly for well known
layer structures such as cadmium chloride, and for twin junctions.  The
contents of the book must, however, also be recommended to molecular and
macromolecular crystallographers who encounter the same penetrating rods and
sectional layers.</p>
