The International Union of Crystallography was founded in 1948 which was a 
great year for innovation; we recently celebrated 
<a href="../1998/sep98/man50.html">
50 years of computing</a> in Manchester and the opening of the
<a href="../1999/mar99/bbk50.html">Bio-molecular Structure Laboratory</a>
 at Birkbeck College, London  The Editors of 'Acta Crystallographica'
decided to issue a special commemorative edition and invited Henk Schenk be
a guest editor. This volume is the result; it was first published as
'Section 1' of the November 1998 issue of <em>'Acta Crystallographica A'</em>
so those of you with subscriptions will have read it already.  The editors
produced the book by reprinting the pages of the journal, (including the
advertisements and original page numbers!) and added a hard cover. This kept
the printing costs down. The book is sold at a remarkably low price for a
hardback book in these days and is well worth the money. It contains 26
review articles written by eminent authorities in the field. 
<a href="../../obits/biog.html">A brief biography </a>
of some of the contributors is provided. Each article is
complete in itself with copious references. Together they form an excellent
survey of the state of crystallography across the pure sciences at the end
of the twentieth century. There is little on hardware, applications, or
advances due to improvements in computers.

<P>
The initial articles are of general interest to everyone. The first one is
by Durward Cruickshank on the history of the Union; he was the ideal person
to write this since he has personally been involved with Union activities
since its inception. Then follows an article by Istv&aacute;n Hargittai on
'Symmetry in Crystallography' and one by Jenny Glusker on teaching; She
defines the attributes of a good teacher and describes mentoring as
essential. We learn that W.H.Bragg's concern for his student Kathleen
Lonsdale led him to organise a grant to help her pay a housekeeper to care
for her three young children so that she could work on her research in his
laboratory. Michael Rossman describes the development of the determination
of structures from simple salts to sophisticated viruses. He begins much
further back than 50 years, with a reference to the work of Robert Hooke in
1665. Frank Allen describes crystallographic databases, John Helliwell
discusses the uses of synchrotron radiation and Terry Willis those of
neutron scattering. There is plenty to interest members of each BCA group
here, including advances in powder diffraction analysis for our Industrial
Group,  phase transformations in smart materials for the physicists,
molecular models for muscle contraction for the biologists and real time
<em>'in situ'</em> observations of chemical reactions for the chemists.

<P>
The editors initially listed 80 topics of interest before cutting the list
to the 26 articles printed here, which are not perhaps the same 26 which
others might have chosen. I should have liked to see their list of rejected
topics, perhaps printed as a summary at the end with a few words drawing the
various themes of the articles together.  There is a 'Contents' with a
'mini-abstract' for each paper, but <em>no index</em>, which would have made
the wealth of information in this book much more accessible.</p><br>
