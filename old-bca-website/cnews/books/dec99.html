Ice is an important material, both for the role it plays in our everyday
lives and for a wide range of science.  Despite its molecular simplicity, it
forms at least 13 crystalline phases and possesses some unusual and
fascinating properties.  '<I>The Physics of Ice'</I> sets out to explain
these properties in terms of their causes at the molecular level and it
achieves its aim admirably.  The 320 pages of text form a concise but
complete reference book on the topic, suitable for all those whose research
impinges on any aspect of ice physics. Clear explanations, aided by useful
diagrams and tables of data, cover the main topics, with sufficient
references to more esoteric areas.

<P>
The introductory chapter starts by reminding us of the range of areas in
which ice is important, a topic which is picked up later in a fascinating
chapter on ice as it occurs in various natural situations. It then provides
a starting point for the newcomer to the area, with sections on the free
water molecule and the hydrogen bond.  The book commences in earnest in
chapter 2, which covers the normal form of ice, ice Ih.  Methods for sample
growth, the effect of the hydrogen disorder on the entropy and lattice
energy calculations are all clearly covered; the heart of the chapter is a
detailed review of the basic crystallography of the material, covering both
average and actual structural information. Chapter 3 is the first
introduction to the macroscopic, presenting data on the elastic and thermal
properties of ice.  The chapter also contains a large section on lattice
vibrations in ice, covering infrared, Raman and inelastic neutron studies.
The recent controversy over the interpretation of the peaks in the
translational band is covered in a fair and unbiased manner. Chapters 3 to 6
deal with the different point defects which occur in ice, leading to a
discussion of the related electrical and diffusional properties. Chapter 7
extends this by dealing with the topic of dislocations and planar defects.
Other chapters cover the mechanical, optical, electronic, surface, adhesion
and frictional properties of ice.  Of great interest to the crystallographic
community, chapter 11 contains an up-to-date review of the high pressure and
low temperature phases of ice, including updated phase diagrams and a very
helpful one-page summary table.  The chapter also looks at the related
structures of  the amorphous ices and the clathrate hydrates.

A new text book on the Physics of Ice has long been overdue - the previous
classic of Hobbs being published in 1974 - and this book admirably fills
that role. The careful scholarship and complementary expertise of the two
authors have combined to produce a useful addition to every library and many
personal collections.  This book provides much for the ice specialist, the
newcomer to the field and those seeking any information about this amazing
material.

<I>Editor's Note: I  am trying to set up a BCA web page for  the structure of ice. I am most grateful to Vicky for providing the material which she used in helping John Finney to explain the new form of ice to visitors at the Royal Society exhibition in 1998.  Further suggestions for additions to this page would be most welcome.</I>

Robert Hazen is a Professor of Earth Sciences at George Mason University in
the United States; he is fascinated by the mechanism of the production of
natural diamonds and hopes that understanding the creation of synthetic ones
will lead him to an understanding of the formation of the natural ones. His
last sentence of this book is: <I>"For us, science remains the greatest
adventure of all". </I> You can imagine his horror when his son, at the age
of about 12, came home from a particularly boring textbook science lesson
and said <I>"Why would anyone want to be a scientist?".  </I>This book is
the author's attempt to answer that question by writing an entertaining
account of the history of diamond synthesis.

<P>
BCA members can probably skip the introductory chapter, entitled continuing
throughout the growth in chemical knowledge in the nineteenth century; they
started from graphite as the raw material and were all failures. There are
stories of 'helpful' technicians who were so sorry for their employer whose
attempts always came to nothing that they hid a few natural diamonds in the
equipment for him to find.  This leads to the interesting question of how to
decide whether or not the minute crystals left in the apparatus are diamond,
a task for a crystallographer, who may use X-rays to find the structure or
topography to look closely at the surface.  We learn of other 'inventors'
who were prosecuted for fraud when their 'synthetic diamonds' were found to
have scratches on them showing they were natural diamonds found in alluvial
gravels. Diamonds have been valued as jewels for hundreds of years; a whole
industry has grown up to market the natural diamonds.  To enhance their
sparkle as jewels diamonds are cut in geometric patterns; the cutting
produces industrially useful splinters, used, for example, in dies to draw
out fine wires for electric motors. This growing need for industrial
diamonds prompted commercial companies to attempt diamond synthesis,
including General Electric in the United States,  and ASEA, Sweden's major
electrical company. They had the resources to fund the high pressure
equipment needed, but the author laments the fact that we may never resolve
the controversy over who first synthesised diamond in the 1950s because the
research in industrial companies is rarely published immediately.  In the
chapter '<I>Secrets</I>' the author explains that some of this reluctance to
publish may have been due to uncertainty over whether they really had made
diamond and their reluctance to be proved wrong later.

<P>
Further chapters cover making diamonds by explosion, by vapour deposition
and possible uses of diamond as semiconductors. There are many other tales
of the pioneers in the field, including the involvement of Kathleen
Lonsdale, who had a newly synthesised  form of diamond named after her.  I
enjoyed this book very much; it is excellent value for money and will make
an ideal Christmas present for a crystallographer interested in the history
of science or for anyone fascinated by the remarkable structure of diamond.
