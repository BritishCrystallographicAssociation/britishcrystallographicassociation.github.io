One of the exciting aspects of high-pressure technology is the remarkable
scope of phenomena which are now studied. Non-ambient density work now
ranges from well-established fields such as geophysics through to emerging
new areas like the effect of pressure on biological systems. This book 
provides a very timely review and description of techniques for studies at
high pressure across a very wide range of science.
<P>
The book is structured as a series of self-contained chapters written by
experts in the field being described. Initially pressure generation and
measurement are explored and the section on pressure generation is
noteworthy as a concise and readable review of pressure cell technology. The
book then proceeds to describe measurement techniques in fields ranging from
physics, through chemistry to biology. Measurement of physical properties
covers electrical resistivity, x-ray and neutron diffraction, light
scattering, M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy and viscometry. The chapters on
chemistry cover techniques to carry out and monitor chemical reactions at
elevated pressures, the use of high-pressure NMR for studies of molecular
dynamics, the application of high pressure for studies of chemical kinetics
and thermodynamics, and the use of high pressure as an aid to chemical
synthesis. Finally, biological applications are covered with a chapter on
electrophoresis of proteins at high pressure. 

<P>
As the title suggests the book is aimed at the experimentalist and provides
a good entry-level introduction. The sections provide practical descriptions
and illustrations and discuss the pro and cons of the techniques being
described. In such a wide-ranging book, the amount  of space available to
any one technique is limited but the sections are copiously referenced to
provide further detail. For readers starting out in a new field, the step by
step protocols for carrying out experiments which are found through-out the
book will be particularly useful.  

<P>
Overall, this book is a good starter book for researchers new to the field
of high pressure studies and would be a valuable addition to the library of
any group working in this field as initial reading for a new
graduate-student or post-doc. The broad coverage of the book and its
relatively high price mean that it is unlikely to appeal to
crystallographers in general.
