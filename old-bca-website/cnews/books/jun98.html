This is a general Physical Chemistry textbook intended for undergraduates in
their first and second years of a Chemistry B.Sc. It covers all the usual
topics such as quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and kinetics. Chapter 3 is
of particular interest as it covers first point group symmetry, with a
startling picture of a large Doberman dog as an illustration of
<em>s<SUB>n</SUB></em> symmetry,  immediately followed by a description of
crystal symmetry.  This arrangement works well.  The description of X-ray
crystallographic analysis, later in the same chapter, is beautifully written
and a model of conciseness, covering all the major topics from the Bragg
equation through to the representation of electron density by a Fourier
series, with equations, all in just 16 pages.  Unfortunately, I feel that
this may be its Achilles heel, as the average first, or even second year
student is likely to encounter problems when learning from such a compact
text.  Unfortunately, the description also omits any mention of powder
diffraction, or neutron diffraction and has missed the opportunity of
guiding students to computer databases of structures, which have been
available for some time.<BR>

<P>
Generally  I found the book a little old fashioned.  In the quantum
mechanics chapter, there is only one paragraph on tunnelling, and this fails
to mention the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM),  a rather serious
omission since the STM is the only technique by which individual atoms can
be directly observed and manipulated.  I also feel that the use of a pair of
headphones, to obtain a balance on a Wheatstone bridge when measuring the
resistance of an electrolyte, may give the student the wrong impression of
current technology.  There is also no material on statistical
thermodynamics,  reaction dynamics or lasers and only a mention of surface
chemistry; but perhaps these are third or fourth year subjects.<BR>

<P>
When compared with similar texts such as P.W. Atkins, "Physical Chemistry",
6th Edn., and G.M. Barrows, "Physical Chemistry", 6th Edn, which have a
similar price, it is clear that this "Introduction to Physical Chemistry" is
shorter, as would be expected from its title.  Interestingly, Atkins and
Ladd's books are the first two I have encountered which try hard to utilise
computers as learning aids.  Ladd gives a world wide web (WWW) address
<BR><strong>ftp://ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk/pub/science/outgoing/Ladd/READ.DOC</strong>  from
which programs can be downloaded and run, which presupposes that the student
has access to an internetted PC,  while Atkins provides a CD with the book,
which presupposes a CD drive on the PC. The use of a WWW address has the
advantage over the CD that it can be updated easily, while the CD has the
advantage of immediacy and moving graphics.  This is the beginning of a new
trend and it will be interesting to see where it goes. In the future, will
we buy a CD with WWW addresses in it and no book?

<P>
Having been somewhat critical of Mark Ladds "Introduction to Physical
Chemistry", I must end on a positive note.  The chapter which deals with the
solid state is excellent.  

<P>
It combines the solid state physics of band structures and free electron
theory, with structural descriptions which are more usually the province of
inorganic chemistry.  This is unusual in a general physical chemistry text
and is a definite high point of the book.

<strong><em>Editor's Notes:</em></strong>
<ul>
  <li>
I have downloaded some of the WWW
problems for the student. They run under DOS, which has the advantage that
you do not need the latest variety of 'Microsoft Windows' on your PC to try
the exercises. The  programs are written in Fortran77, so should be portable
to other computers.  If there is sufficient demand I may be able to help do
this for VAX/VMS systems or for Acorn RISC microcomputers. <BR>If you have
the book beside you the problems look useful. However, if you get stuck and
want to download the solutions you may need some variety of 'Windows'
because they are written in Adobe PDF format. (PDF viewers are freely
available via the Internet if you do not have one.) I understand  the
publisher may send out printed paper copies of the solutions on request to
purchasers of the book.

<strong><a name="p51">A Practical </a>Guide for the Preparation of Specimens <BR>
for X-Ray Fluorescence and X-Ray Diffraction Analysis</strong><BR>
<em>Edited by:</em> V. E. Buhrke,  R. Jenkins, D.K. Smith<BR>
<em>Publisher:</em> John Wiley &amp; Sons 1998 333 pages<BR>
<em>Price (hardback)</em> &pound;65  ISBN 0 471 19458 1
<P>
This new book is aimed at the practical scientist, both beginner and
experienced, who needs to extract a sample from a bulk material and prepare
a representative homogeneous specimen for analysis. The 31 contributors
impart some necessary repetition, but overall the book has a logical flow
and is easy to read. 

<P>
The coverage of a wide range of materials is split in favour of those used
for X-Ray Diffraction. Although this review concentrates on the Diffraction
aspects many of the comments are equally applicable to the Fluorescence
content. The book starts with a general introduction covering basic
statistics, obtaining a representative sample from a bulk, grinding,
absorption, crystallinity and particle effects and includes 26 references.
<BR>The 88 pages of Chapters 2 &amp; 3 cover Fluorescence and contain 147
references. Chapters 4-7 are dedicated to Diffraction and span 141 pages
with 114 references. 

<P>
The coverage is detailed and for beginners will provide all the information
needed to embark on the preparation of powder diffraction specimens. The
experienced user may find that the coverage of their particular speciality
falls short of their expectations. However, for procedures and materials
that are unfamiliar, the book will be invaluable. Materials covered include
metals, minerals, clays, zeolites, forensics, paper, reactive, toxic,
radioactive and explosive. Preparation techniques are included for small
samples and thin films. The new aerosol suspension technique is described
well with good supporting diagrams. A whole chapter is devoted specifically
to specimens for cameras and there are sections on high-pressure studies and
synchrotron radiation. Chapter 8 covers the equipment necessary for sample
preparation for both techniques. It includes lists of equipment required and
vendor addresses. The final chapter is devoted to X-Ray Fluorescence
Standards and instrumental dricorrection.

<P>
Many laboratories that use both techniques and only buy one copy because of
the high price in the UK, might have a conflict of ownership. If I have a
criticism it has to be the US bias in the materials and suppliers lists. Has
anyone in the UK heard of Tackiwax or Cow gum? Finding an item of interest
is sometimes difficult with the list of contents often being more useful
than the index. The book should be read from cover to cover and not just
used for reference.This text is ideally suited for conversion to a
multimedia CD-ROM with video clips of the various preparation procedures.
Web links could provide updated information, references and country specific
supplier information.

<P>
Many scientists spend too little time on specimen preparation, preferring to
devote their time to the more interesting and rewarding data processing
aspects. Their results can be unreliable because specimens are not
reproducible or representative. Following the principles outlined in this
book will produce good specimens and lay the foundations for analytical
reliability. This book is a must for the reference shelves of all X-ray
analysis laboratories.
