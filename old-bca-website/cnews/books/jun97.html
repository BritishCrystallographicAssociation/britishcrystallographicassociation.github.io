This is the long awaited second edition of a relatively familiar
text written for senior undergraduate or graduate students who
have intentions towards professional crystallography. The subject
matter ranges from crystallographic principles, through diffraction
processes to the collection and interpretation of data, structure
determination being the final aim. The book is principally directed
towards the single crystal rather than the powder practitioner,
although the text would serve both admirably for fundamental principles.
<p>

The crystallography is described in a logical sequence and is
well illustrated providing clear explanations of point group and
space group symmetry. General  X-ray scattering  processes are
considered in a formal manner leading naturally to the structure
factor and Braggs Law. A chapter on data collection provides particularly
clear descriptions of the oscillation and Weissenberg camera methods.
This  forms a good practical reference. Perhaps of particular
note is a section examining the physical and optical properties
of crystals and how these are related to crystal symmetry.  As
expected, structure determination is comprehensively presented
through concise descriptions of trial & error methods, the Patterson
function, heavy atom method, anomalous scattering and direct methods.
All are illustrated by carefully worked examples. The final chapter
deals with the accuracy of the refinement process.
<p> 
At first sight, the edition appears similar to the first. However,
a significant change (and certainly an enhancement) is the inclusion
of FORTRAN(R) listings for a series of 12 computer programs. The
arduous task of typing these is not necessary as a

is provided from which the source codes can be downloaded. However,
at the time of writing this was apparently unavailable. In a relatively
inspired approach, the reader is able to use the programs to perform
guided calculations at various points within the text, albeit
for 2-D only. For example, based upon an artificial structure
provided, structure factors and a Patterson map can be calculated
and examined.
<p>
The inclusion of sections covering synchrotron radiation, image
plates and Laue methods for proteins are also new for this edition.
However, the section on optical diffractometers has been excluded.
This is perhaps disappointing as the visual impact of optical
diffraction patterns and the optical analogue are powerful teaching
aids.
<p>
Overall, this is a comprehensive text of fundamental principles
and theory delivered, on the whole, in a traditional manner. 
The text is also supported at the end of each chapter by problems
 with adequate solutions. Any potential purchaser would certainly
receive value for money especially as a softback version is also
available at œ22.95.  Although perhaps not a book for the occasional
user, I would wholeheartedly recommend this as a  solid, formal
text for the serious X-ray crystallographer.
