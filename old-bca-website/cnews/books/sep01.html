This text book is aimed at advanced undergraduates and post graduate
students working in the areas of solid-state chemistry, physics, materials
science and earth science, and also contains information that will be of
value to more experienced research workers and lecturers.  In this new
edition the first edition has been significantly expanded (242 pp to 331)
and much of the material has been revised and updated.  In particular, the
reader is introduced to topics that are of more general interest but that
are closely related to the basic concepts of crystallography and
diffraction.  
</p
<P>
By comparison to the first edition, in the second edition Chapter 1 is
expanded to show how a variety of more complex crystal structures can be
explained in terms of different faulting sequences of close-packed layers. 
In addition, the structures of carbon including fullerenes are discussed,
and related to the development of symmetry ideas.  In Chapter 2 the figures
have been updated and these facilitate a clearer understanding of
two-dimensional and, consequently, three-dimensional symmetry.  Non-periodic
patterns are also introduced.  Chapter 3 now includes a short discussion on
space-filling polyhedra and in Chapter 4 the discussion of space groups is
significantly expanded, and is a very helpful background to the
understanding of the Space Group representations in Vol. A of the
<em>International Tables for Crystallography</em>.  Chapters 5 and 6,
covering lattice planes and Miller indices, and the reciprocal lattice, have
been revised, and are now easier to read and understand.  In Chapter 7 the
human eye as an optical instrument is discussed, and the processes involved
are related to the situation in the diffraction process for other
wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.  In Chapter 8 the contributions of
von Laue, the Braggs and Ewald to X-ray diffraction are described.  Chapters
9 and 10 in the first edition have been expanded to Chapters 9, 10 and 11 in
the new edition.  The topics of X-ray and neutron diffraction from ordered
crystals, preferred orientation and its measurement are now covered in
detail, and the relevance of the work on preferred orientation to materials
and earth sciences emphasised.  Chapter 12 contains an excellent discussion
and explanation of stereographic projections, and the usefulness of the
method explained.  The book is completed with a series of useful appendices
including details of crystallographic model builders, crystallographic
software, biographical notes on famous crystallographers and other
scientists working in the area of diffraction, useful crystallographic
relationships, vectors and complex numbers, and systematic absences.  There
are useful teaching exercises at the end of each chapter with quite detailed
answers at the end of the book.
</p>
<P>
Overall, the second edition represents a significant improvement on the
already high quality first edition.  The material is clearly laid out and
the subject is developed logically.  The fundamental importance of symmetry
is made at an early stage.  While the subject matter is correctly described
as 'basic' the text can be read at several levels and there are aspects that
will be of interest to undergraduate students and others that are better
suited to researchers with greater experience and expertise.  Throughout,
the text is very readable, and the level of mathematics is appropriate to
the subject matter covered.  The additional material of preferred
orientation fibrous materials is very interesting and useful, and is the
discussion of electron diffraction and its applications given in Chapter 11.  
</p>
<P>
I strongly recommend this book to students and lecturers working in the area
of crystallography and diffraction.  The textbook is one in a series
sponsored by the International Union of Crystallography and published by
Oxford University Press.

    This is a fascinating book for all those interested in the history of
science, especially those who wonder why some people become great scientists
and yet others with apparently similar abilities leave science altogether.
This book describes the lives of 15 women who have either themselves won a
Nobel prize or played a crucial role in a Nobel-prize winning project; it
tries to answer the question: why have only 10  of recipients of the Nobel
Prize in the sciences been women when there have been over 300 men since the
Prizes were first awarded in 1901?  

<P>
   The first chapter, '<em>A Passion for Discovery</em>' analyses the
qualities these women had in common which enabled them to overcome the many
obstacles in their way.
 
<UL>
<LI><em>First, they adored science</em>, they had many other activities but
they were all passionately determined and in love with their work.
 
<LI><em>They had sympathetic parents and influential relatives;</em> most of
them were from professional or academic families; for example we learn that
Dorothy Hodgkin's uncle asked a friend for advice as to how Dorothy could
continue in science after her first degree. The friend replied she should
should try to become a student of J.D.Bernal.

<LI><em>Religious values stressing education were critical; </em> some were
Quakers and half were Jewish. 

<LI><em>Behind many of these successful women stood a man;  </em>the Braggs
and J.D.Bernal encouraged a generation of English women crystallographers,
including Dorothy Hodgkin. Others were not so fortunate, on page 7 we read
<em>'Unfortunately for Jocelyn Bell Burnell's career her thesis adviser
failed to become her mentor and she received little or no career
counselling.'</em>

<LI><em>Good luck and timing were vitally important; </em> pioneers like
Marie Curie and Lise Meitner came of age just as European Universities
opened their doors to women;  eight of the fifteen women were born within
fifteen years of each other, eleven within a single generation between 1896
and 1921. Some, like Gertrude Elion, (prize winner in 1988) had worked for
years without managing to get a 'scientific' job, but it was not until late
in the Second World War that the shortage of industrial chemists enabled her
to get a research post with Burroughs Wellcome. There she worked on purines,
studying not only their structures but also their biochemical reactions,
searching for better drugs for diseases such as leukaemia and others to
prevent rejection in transplanted kidneys. 

</UL>
<P>
The book has 3 sections, 'First generation pioneers', including Marie Curie
and Lise Meitner, 'Second generation' which includes both Dorothy Hodgkin
and Rosalind Franklin, and 'The New Generation', Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an
astronomer who discovered quasars as a graduate student, and Christiane
N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, a developmental biologist who gained the Nobel prize
for physiology and medicine in 1995.
</p>
<P>
Each woman's life is described in a separate chapter using information from
primary and secondary sources and interviews with colleagues, students,
family, friends and experts in the field. Bibliographic references for the
sources are collected into a section of 'Notes' at the end and there is a
comprehensive index. All scientific explanations are nontechnical and
illustrated with simple diagrams or photographs, including some I had not
seen before for the crystallographers. 
</p>
<P>

 I enjoyed this book;  I learned new facts on the careers of some people I
thought I knew all about and as a physicist I was surprised to find I
understood the more biological and medical chapters.</p>
