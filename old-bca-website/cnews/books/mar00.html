<P>This book fills a significant gap in the literature on diffraction
covering specific applications of the technique in industry. It is divided
into three parts covering an Introduction to principles and practice of
x-ray diffraction, Industrial Applications and Speciality Techniques.

The introduction written by the editors spanning 50 pages in three chapters
gives concise well-written coverage of the history, theory, practice,
progress and potential of X-ray diffraction. It sets the scene for the rest
of the content and the standard for the large number of useful references
(161 in total for the introduction).

The second and largest part of the book covers industrial applications in 5
sections, 25 chapters and spans 649 pages. Each chapter is written by
acknowledged experts in a style that is easy to read and well illustrated
with over 850 photographs, drawings, equations and tables in the book. The
division of this part into sections on: High-Tech; Metals; Minerals and
Ceramics; Polymers and Composites; and Chemicals seems arbitrary and
unnecessary. The 25 chapters cover: Semiconductors; Aerospace; Automotive;
Petroleum; Hydrometallurgy; Fractography; Mining; Cement; Silica;
Glass-Ceramics; Polymers; Paint & Pigment; Pharmaceutical; Energy; Lighting;
Photography; Detergents; Museums; Forensic; and Customs; with more than one
chapter on some topics. The final chapter offers some guidance for
outsourcing diffraction work to a commercial service laboratory.

</p>
<p>The third part of the book covers Speciality Techniques with sections on
Radiation; Microstructure and Instrumentation; and Diffraction Patterns in
12 chapters and spans 188 pages. It opens with using synchrotron radiation
and electron microscopy and goes on to cover: Line Profiles; Thin films and
Multilayers; Residual Stress; Warren-Averbach; Microbeam; Non-ambient; NIST
reference materials; Grain orientation and Texture; and Structure Analysis
from powder data. Each of these chapters gives a good overview of these
specific applications with plenty of well-chosen examples and lots of
references for further reading.

</P>
<P>The use of well-chosen experts to write the individual chapters makes for
a book in which state of the art coverage is achieved in so many diverse
applications and techniques. It is a tribute to the editors and authors that
the individual contributions gel into a whole that is consistent and of high
quality with very little duplication. The high cost of the book makes
individual purchase difficult to justify and its size and weight will
restrict it to the bookshelf.
 
</P>
<P>This book covers new ground, is a good read and is a must for the
bookshelves of all laboratories doing work in materials characterisation and
the libraries of teaching establishments. Each chapter being self-contained
makes it very easy to dip into relevant topics and the useful index is a
helpful starting point for specific queries. It will open many eyes to the
diverse applications of X-ray Diffraction in industry and be of benefit to
both beginners and experienced practitioners of the technique.  </P>

published by the Oxford University Press (Book Series).<BR>

<P>
Research in the area of hydrogen bonding is an evergreen endeavour and
hydrogen bonds continue to manifest themselves in myriad ways in structural
chemistry and biology. The weak hydrogen bond is a part of this extended
domain. The roots of the subject reach far back in time, but development has
long been slow. A sharp increase of the literature directly related to weak
hydrogen bonding occurred in the mid l990s. The facts that have accumulated
concerning this particular interaction type have just about acquired a
critical enough mass, that the writing of the book was both timely and
useful. Fully a quarter of all the ~900 citations represent publications
that appeared after the authors commenced their efforts. </p>

<P>
The book is divided into three sections. The first (Chapter 1) provides an
introduction to the weak hydrogen bond in relation to hydrogen bonds in
general and defines the scope of the work. The second and largest section
(Chapters 2 and 3) deals with the development of the concept of the weak
hydrogen bond. This has been done in two different ways. In Chapter 2, the
authors have selected the C-H...0 bond as the prototype of the entire
interaction type, and have analysed it in detail in order to justify its
inclusion in the larger hydrogen bond family. In Chapter 3, the authors have
then extended these arguments to a very wide range of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors. This includes weak acceptors such as<FONT FACE="Symbol">
p</FONT>-systems and weak donors in which the H atom is covalently bonded to
phosphorous, chalcogen and transition metal atoms. The third and final
section is concerned with the ways in which weak hydrogen bonds may be
employed in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering (Chapter 4) and
how they influence biological structure and function (Chapter 5). A brief
recapitulation (Chapter 6) concludes the work.</p>

<P>
It is a real pleasure to read the book. The volume can be useful for an
absolute beginner in this field giving a very general introduction in the
problem, providing a profound and, at the same time, a concise historical
background. The book is equally helpful for those actively engaged in the
research on weak hydrogen bonds (either fundamental, or applied) because of
the enormous amount of valuable and up-to-date information (it is enough to
mention that the book has 304 figures, 63 tables, 228 structural diagrams).
The book is very well organized, each chapter having a recapitulation and a
concise summary. It can be used also as a text-book by chemistry,
crystallography, biology students.</p>

It is approximately twenty years since I first encountered an edition of
Born and Wolf as an undergraduate in Physics. It was probably the 6th
Edition, published in 1980 (assuming that Oxford's libraries were roughly
up-to-date), which was re-printed 7 times and re-issued once in the
subsequent 20 years. This level of activity at the printing-press is
testament to the fact that Born and Wolf has remained compulsory reading for
the student physicist since first published in 1959. It has continued to be
highly relevant reading throughout the past forty years during the huge
explosion of interest in optics brought about by the advent of the laser.
Evidently, this book has the status of a classic text.</p>
 
<P>
My first reactions on being approached to review the book were (a) this book
is big and heavy (it runs to 852 pages plus Appendices and weighs 1.6 kg);
(b) who am I to be reviewing this sacred text ? I have to admit that it
presented a somewhat daunting task and that I have not read every single
word. Instead, I have dipped in to various parts of the book, particularly
the new <EM>"expanded"</EM> parts and those most relevant (I hope) to
readers of Crystallography News, in producing this review. </p>
 
<P>
This is a well-presented book, generally pleasing to the eye and easy to
read. As anyone acquainted with the earlier editions would expect, this is
still principally a classical optics text: the first six chapters take us
through from <EM>"Basic Properties of the Electromagnetic Field"</EM> to
<EM>"Image Forming Instruments"</EM> by way of three chapters on geometrical
optics. The latter subject, which used to be a strong element of a physics
education, is generally now sadly lacking in the undergraduate syllabus. A
diligent reader of Born and Wolf could certainly become highly proficient in
the subject; bearing in mind that the treatment of geometrical optics does
proceed from the electromagnetic theory in the earlier chapters rather than
<EM>"simple"</EM> ray optics. The said diligent reader would really need to
be a final year undergraduate, post-graduate or researcher to appreciate the
approach; from the publisher's notes, this is the intended readership. </p>
 
<P>
The fourth chapter, "Geometrical theory of Optical Imaging", is one of the
new additions, a full section on <I>Computerized Tomography</I> (the CT or
CAT scan in medicine), which contains a nice historical introduction and a
clear explanation of the foundations of the technique. This is extended in
Chapter 13, <EM>"Scattering from Inhomogeneous Media"</EM> to the subject of
<EM>"Diffraction Tomography"</EM>, a current <EM>"hot topic"</EM> at
synchrotron radiation sources such as ESRF. In Diffraction Tomography
diffraction of the probing radiation is taken into account. Whereas in
current X- ray studies, the diffraction aspect is being used to gain
information about hard matter; as the book points out diffraction tomography
using ultra-sound, for example, can be used to access higher-resolution
information about soft tissues. one of the authors, Wolf, derived a central
theorem of diffraction tomography, so anyone intending to undertake this
type of studies should certainly read the clear mathematical account in this
book.</p>
  
<P>
Chapters 7-11 deal with interference and diffraction of light at slits,
obstacles, apertures, arrays etc. I found Chapter 10 <EM>"Interference and
Diffraction with Partially Coherent Light"</EM> of most direct interest
because of the extensive discussions of the effects of spatial and temporal
coherence. The increasing coherence lengths available at present-day
synchrotron radiation sources has raised the issue of coherence high in the
scientific consciousness and I found this Chapter very useful reading. I
skipped Chapter 12, diffraction of light by ultra-sonic waves, in favour of
a deeper reading of Chapter 13 (see above). An X-ray crystallographer
reading this book would naturally turn to this Chapter first since nearly
all the index references to X-ray diffraction lie therein. (The only
reference found elsewhere is in Chapter 8, a reference to Gabor's method of
imaging by reconstructed wavefronts, otherwise known as holography. It seems
that crystallographers were there first with a method of two-step
photography,  a method of optical Fourier analysis for reconstruction of
crystal structures from diffraction patterns first proposed by Boersch in
1938 and independently by Bragg in 1942). This chapter includes the theory
for scattering of X-rays from crystals, including Bragg reflection as a
special case of scattering from a periodic potential,  the Ewald sphere and
the Laue equations. The section ends with a brief mention of the importance
that Bragg's law assumes in the theory of the formation of (optical) volume
holograms. </p>
 
<P>
Readers of '<I>Crystallography News</I>' might also, but possibly less
frequently than some might think desirable, turn to the final chapter on
crystal optics. This summarizes in 62 pages all the background theory for
isotropic, uniaxial and biaxial crystal optics. It would not, however, be a
very useful handbook for a crystallographer with a slice of material at the
polarizing microscope.</p>
  
<P>
 	So, should BCA members run out and buy this book ? I think the answer is
that if you require an excellent text on classical optics, then you might
well consider this one, especially now that it includes some relevant
material on X-ray scattering. However, if you already have a copy of an
earlier edition of this text, perhaps this new edition does not have enough
new material to make an extra purchase worthwhile. It is a little surprising
that a modern edition of the book lacks any colour plates in covering a
photogenic subject such as optics and that given the extension of the scope
of the book to cover some X-ray material, nothing is mentioned of advances
in X-ray optics (e.g. Bragg-Fresnel lenses and the like). However, it is
good to see the basic theory of X-ray crystallography propounded in a
mainstream optics text-book and to find reference to the work of famous
crystallographers in the optical context. As one would expect of this book,
it remains in its new guise a classical text.
