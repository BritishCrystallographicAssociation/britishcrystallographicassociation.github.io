<h2><a name="woolf">Methods</a> galore</h2>

Physical and Non-Physical methods of Solving Crystal Structures. <br>
 By M. M. Woolfson and Fan Hai-Fu.  Cambridge University Press: 1995.<br>
  Pp 276.  ISBN 0 521 41299 4.  £45.00, $69.95.<br>


Increasingly, crystal structures are solved by centring a crystal (or a
series of crystals) in an x-ray beam and running a series of programs which
ultimately list the atomic coordinates and draw appropriate diagrams.  The
most important skill appears to be the knowledge of which programs to run
and how to run them.
<p>

This book presents the fundamental ideas which underlie methods of reaching
a structural solution, revealing complexities of the basic skeletons which
support the smooth, well-rounded, user-friendly automata which serve us :
mechanisms which many of us will never look inside.  It is suitable for
postgraduate students with some grounding in crystallography.  It covers
methods which have been developed over 50 years, some appropriate for
crystals with a dozen atoms in the asymmetric unit, some for electron
micrographs of two-dimensionally ordered specimens up to 100Å thick.  It
gives excellent insight into new methods still on the test-bed, and offers
tantalising glimpses of better methods just around the corner.  It will
cause every one of us to question whether the program we just ran was the
most appropriate means to solve the structure.
<p>

For me, one of the most thrilling chapters was the one entitled Direct
Methods, which begins with structure invariants and Harker-Kasper
inequalities, and leads right through the tangent formula and higher-order
determinants to magic integers and SAYTAN.  Here Woolfson is on his home
ground, and the presentation is brilliant.  The methods for phase extension,
for developing solutions to superstructures, for density modification, and
the progress of methods for ab initio phasing come over equally well. 
Perhaps best of all is the final chapter, which presents the use of 3-beam
scattering measurements for direct phase observation, in clear and simple
terms.
<p>
The book is strongly based in "Direct Methods".  The protein crystallography
sections concentrate on the single isomorphous replacement  (SIR) method,
and the opportunities to use direct methods to resolve the consequent phase
ambiguities (even to the point of describing the Blow & Crick method for
phase determination as a treatment of the SIR method).  This is justified by
the misleading statement that usually one isomorphous derivative can be
found with little difficulty, but to find a second may not be
straightforward.  Anomalous scattering is treated extensively, but the
elegant solution created by combining it with SIR (SIRAS) is not brought
out.  MIRAS is only mentioned in passing (in discussion of the maximum
entropy method) and the work by B.W. Matthews and by A.C.T. North on the
proper way of combining MIR and AS is not mentioned.  Similarly,
non-crystallographic symmetry is presented almost entirely from the point of
view of small molecule structures, despite its huge importance in the
largest structures, especially viruses.

 This addition to the well known books on symmetry by the Hargittais is a
picture book of places and objects they have photographed on their travels
over 20 years. It attempts to explain the concepts of symmetry in a simple
way, using everyday objects. There are 15 sections, including ones on
mirror, rotational, translational and spiral symmetries. The diagram on the
right is from the section on Band Patterns, (page 135) These are from
Hungarian needlework designs. The small triangular motifs beneath each one
show the type of repetition.<p>
 <br>
This is only one of the many useful diagrams
with which to explain symmetrical concepts, and perhaps attract more
students to crystallography. Other sections cover the symmetries of
polyhedra, anti-symmetry, and the last one  'Diamonds and Glass'.<p>
 <br>
      I now realise I should have included balloons in my list of
crystallographic toys, (See 'Crystallography News' Dec 93 p 24-26). The
Hargittais give a clear explanation of how clusters of balloons can be used
to understand how clusters of objects in natural settings form polyhedral
shapes. They show how this applies to molecular structures such as sulphur
hexafluoride.<p>

I found this a fascinating book, and am happy to browse through it at any
time. The only problem is that booksellers do not think it is about
crystallography, so you will not find it by scanning the scientific shelves,
it is more likely to be in 'Art and Design'.<p>
