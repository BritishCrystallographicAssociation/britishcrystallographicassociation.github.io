<P>This book has been compiled with meticulous care and attention to detail. 
Andr&eacute; Authier has been very active in the field of X-ray dynamical
theory for more than 40 years, testing some of the conclusions through to
the exploitation of the theory in topography.  The theory is very relevant
to the analysis of nearly perfect crystals and the design of high-resolution
diffractometers and synchrotron beam lines.</P>

<P>The book is split into four sections; the first is concerned with the
basics and the background.  The first chapter is historical, explaining some
of the conceptual thinking in the development of the theories.  Chapter 2
introduces Maxwell’s equations, fundamental to all electromagnetic waves,
and leads to the concept of polarisability in a crystal and introduces the
Ewald and Laue theories; the former is based on a microscopic approach
assuming the crystal is a series of dipoles, whereas the latter assumes a
distribution of negative charges surrounding positively charged atoms.  The
geometrical (kinematical) theory is also derived in this section along with
the application of the Fresnel equations, used extensively for specular
scattering (reflectometry).  This first section is more than 100 pages, and
is well illustrated with diagrams of the dispersion surface construction and
wave propagation.</P>

<P>Section II describes the theories in greater detail, with many more
derivations leading to interesting consequences, from the deviations from
Bragg’s law to the extreme conditions of back-reflection.  These
applications are especially relevant to the design of monochromators at
synchrotrons.  These properties of wave-fields are considered in
transmission and reflection geometries and their combinations, and how they
form standing waves.  Thirty-five pages are devoted to the interesting
condition when the exit or incident wave is almost parallel to the surface. 
The scattering profile is modified since several positions of the dispersion
surface now have significant contributions to the scattering.  When both
waves are nearly parallel to the surface, scattering planes normal to the
surface can be accessed; this is becoming an increasingly important
technique for probing thin layers and the theory of the method is discussed
in this section.</P>

<P>With monochromatic X-ray wavelengths, we generally assume the scattering
comes from one set of crystal planes, but when several reflections can be
excited simultaneously, fascinating effects occur.  Authier has spared us
much of the mathematical details but describes the boundary conditions for
3-beam dynamical theory and how it can lead to phase determination in
structure determination.  At page 249 the concept of spherical wave
dynamical theory is introduced; basically the plane wave theory cannot model
distorted structures.  Kato's approach of creating a sum of plane waves is
discussed first, with all its implications in various geometries, before the
more generalised theory of Takagi, and its derivations, is covered in
considerable detail.  These descriptions are followed by the mathematics of
ray tracing in perfect crystals, since the optics used to condition the
X-rays will not create a pure plane of spherical wave.  Experimental
examples are given that illustrate these points.</P>

<P>Section III deals with imperfect crystals, working through the Eikonal
approximation and the trajectories of the wave-fields in the plane and
spherical wave theories.  Twenty-eight pages are devoted to the propagation
of waves in highly deformed crystals from the Tagaki theory and statistical
dynamical theory.  The latter is most relevant when the deformation becomes
extreme and the wave coherence is disrupted.</P>

<P>The final section concentrates on applications of the dynamical theories. 
The description of X-ray optics is well illustrated with DuMond diagrams and
the expected profile shapes determined by dynamical theory.  The suppression
of harmonic radiation and the controlling of the polarisation, focusing
mirrors, Fresnel lenses, wave-guides and refractive lenses are all touched
upon in this section.  X-ray interferometry, developed by Bonse and Hart
provides a very good illustration of dynamical theory leading to phase
contrast imaging, Authier then extends this section to the increasing
interest in phase contrast imaging by more direct methods.  An important
consequence of dynamical theory is the standing wave that is created which
is periodic with the crystal lattice; it also extends outside the crystal
and can be used for probing the atoms from their fluorescence yield.  The
formulae pertaining to these effects are presented for the diffraction
condition and for the specular condition; the latter can probe longer length
scales.  This analysis becomes more complex with thin layers and is briefly
discussed.  The largest emphasis on the material applications of dynamical
theory is on topography in its various forms, transmission (projection and
section) and reflection, with a historical perspective of the important
works of Berg and Lang, low and high resolution respectively, right up to
the present day.  This section is well illustrated with experimental and
simulated images.  The volume is rounded off with a list of useful formulae
derived in the book and a transcript of a lecture given by Ewald in
1975.</P>

<P>This monograph covers a very important subject for today's X-ray
scientists which has become a very large field with many applications from
the electronics industry to the design of optics for synchrotron beam lines. 
It is full of references for further reading, and I for one am very pleased
that Andr&eacute; Authier has put into a print a lifetime of experience in
this field.  There will always be sections that one feels should also be
included, for example the analysis of thin films, where dynamical theory is
widely used; these aspects are, however, covered in other books.  The real
value of this monograph is that it brings up to date all the fundamental
approaches and puts them together and explains them in a very good way.</P>

ISBN 0-19-850605-8, xiv + 410 pages .   </P>

<P>This book deals with a field that in the past forty years has grown from
a curiosity to a major field of study.  Joel Bernstein has been one of the
main movers in this development, and the book he has produced is both an
excellent resource book and a very good read - no small feat!  The book
makes extensive and relevant use of stereo diagrams.  Readers who are
unfortunate enough not to be able to focus directly on these should have a
pair of spectacles at hand before starting to read.  </P>


<P>The word &quot;polymorph&quot;, literally meaning &quot;multiform&quot;
or &quot;many-shaped&quot;, is not easy to give a precise definition.
Sometimes the word, which is used in many contexts, seems to describe its
own definition!  Bernstein adopts the definition of McCrone (1965) the a
polymorph is &quot;a solid crystalline phase of a given compound, resulting
from the possibility of at least two different arrangements of the molecules
of that compound in the solid state.&quot;  Thus solvates fall outside the
scope of the book as do such pairs as acetylene (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>)
and benzene (C<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>) with the same chemical composition
but different molecules.   Crystals of molecules in different conformations
are polymorphs, while those of geometrical isomers are not, and the same
borderline cases arise as do in solution or the gas phase. A wide-ranging
historical perspective is included, with particular reference to that still
amazing mine of information, Groth's <I>Chemische Kristallographie</I>
(1906-1919).</P>

<P>     A chapter on &quot;Fundamentals&quot; includes thermodynamic and
other characteristics of polymorphs, including the often confused
distinction between crystal form and crystal habit.  In the structural
fundamentals, the valuable Etter graph sets are introduced.  The development
of these has been much due to Bernstein’s own use and active promotion of
them.</P>

<P>   Chapter 3 deals with the control of crystallisation and hence
polymorph selection, insofar as this is possible. It includes the story of 
&quot;disappearing polymorphs&quot;, which can no longer be made after once
a more stable polymorph has been found.  Chapter 4, the longest in the book,
is a useful description of experimental techniques, headed by a splendid
quote (from a baseball player) &quot;You can observe a lot by just
watching&quot;. In addition to a range of thermal methods and X-ray powder
diffraction, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) is included.</P>

<P>The next two chapters cover conformational polymorphism and
structure-property relationships.  The possibility of various molecular
conformations, differing little in energy, explains the great difficulty in
the prediction of crystal structures, and the failure, so far, of computer
programs to predict structures of significant flexibility.  A number of
fascinating examples are given, including a six-polymorph system with a
convenient range of colour and habit. The presence (or absence) of
significant electrical and magnetic properties distinguishes some
polymorphic crystals from one another, and Bernstein makes a distinction,
which is useful but must sometimes be arbitrary, between differences in
<I>bulk</I> and <I>molecular</I> properties.</P>

<P>There are three shorter chapters dealing specifically with the importance
of polymorphism in pharmaceuticals, pigments and high-energy compounds. The
text concludes with some fascinating accounts of the bizarre legal cases
have been fought over polymorphs, particularly in the pharmaceutical
industry.</P>

<P>The last chapter of the book is a really extensive bibliography, 92 pages
in length, which covers literature up to the end of 2000, with a few entries
for 2001.</P>

<P>All in all, this book can be recommended strongly both for content and
interest.  It is expensive.  Perhaps it would be a good book to share with a
friend?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crystal Structure Analysis </I>represents the
compilation and publication of the material derived from the BCA Intensive
Course in X-Ray Structure Analysis, taken largely from the 1999 Course for
which the authors were the principal lecturers. The book is focused on the
practical aspects of structure analysis, and the succinct introductory
chapter advises readers at the outset that a certain level of prior
knowledge is desirable. Hammond's earlier volume, 
<a href="sep01.html#one"><I>The Basics of
Crystallography and Diffraction</I>,</a>
 from the same IUCr series would seem to
be an ideal companion. 
(Reviewed in September 2001 issue of 'Crystallography News') 
The present book follows essentially the path from
obtaining crystals through to structure publication. The excellent Chapter
2, dealing with crystal growth and evaluation, is drawn unmistakably from
genuine experience and gives the immediate impression that the authors are
masters of their profession.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapters 3 and 4 provide the necessary conceptual
framework for understanding crystal symmetry and the theory of data
collection. The introductory sentence of Chapter 4 is beautifully
understated: &quot;<I>Although many crystal structures are determined by
people with little knowledge of the theory underlying the subject, success
is more likely and problems will be better avoided by some understanding of
the fundamental properties of the crystalline solid state, the nature of
diffraction, and the relationships between a crystal structure and its
diffraction pattern.</I>&quot; Both chapters are necessarily brief, and are
perhaps best considered as concise summaries of assumed prior knowledge. The
discussion of symmetry is densely packed and may appear a little daunting on
first sight. The section concerning data collection theory is somewhat less
thorough and I was a little disappointed by the omission of the Ewald
construction. My disappointment was rapidly tempered, however, by a clear
discussion of the indexing process and orientation matrix.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapters 5 and 6 deal with data collection, using serial
and area-detector instruments respectively. Although the discussion of area
detectors has been augmented slightly from the original Course, the authors
have perhaps failed to reflect the increasing prevalence of these
instruments. The discussion of serial diffractometers is in itself
excellent, and will be valuable for the still considerable number of
four-circle users. The relative balance of Chapters 5 and 6, however,
comprising eighteen and eight pages respectively, might be considered to
lack vision. While the balance is distorted by initial discussions in
Chapter 5 of fundamentals such as the number of independent data, data
corrections, <I>etc.</I>, which are not repeated in Chapter 6, it would be
refreshing to see these issues addressed within a discussion of
area-detector instruments. Equivalence of (<I>hkl</I>) and (<I>h-kl</I>)
within the monoclinic system, for example, might be better illustrated by a
wide-angle CCD frame taken from a monoclinic crystal oriented with the
<I>b</I> axis perpendicular to the X-ray beam, rather than a reflection list
from a serial instrument. I hope that the emphasis might be reconsidered for
any subsequent editions of the book.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapters 7  - 10 deal with the fundamentals of Fourier
syntheses and structure solution. The chapter on Fourier syntheses is
masterful, with the 1-D FeS<SUB>2</SUB> example providing excellent
illustrations of the <I>F</I><SUB>obs</SUB>, <I>F</I><SUB>calc</SUB> and
difference syntheses, and of the effects of series termination. Any previous
Course attendee will be pleased to see that ammonium oxalate monohydrate
retains its rightful prominence in the 2-D examples! Chapter 8, dealing with
Patterson techniques, is equally masterful and equally concise, with the
introductory section on the nature of the Patterson function being
particularly impressive. I would have been pleased to see both Chapters 7
and 8 expanded, but their brevity is consistent with the practical focus of
the book as a whole. Chapter 9 deals with direct methods, in considerably
greater depth than the previous chapters. The lucid discussion of the
physical basis of direct methods gives genuine insight into what many of
usthe book. The discussion of least-squares fitting in Chapter 11 is
excellent and should prove generally valuable to a scientific audience much
wider than the crystallographic community. Discussion of the effects of
restraints and constraints on the least-squares procedure is particularly
enlightening. Chapter 12 concentrates more specifically on crystal structure
refinement and is filled with helpful practical advice; this chapter in
conjunction with suitable example data sets would form the basis of an
excellent refinement workshop. Chapters 13 and 14 describe the derivation of
secondary results, their statistical significance, the effects of errors and
the comparison of results with authority and a healthy realism. As the
number of structure determinations performed by non-specialist
crystallographers inevitably increases, Chapters 13 and 14 should become
mandatory reading.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The closing chapters, dealing with the presentation of
results, the CIF format and structure databases, are relatively lightweight
in comparison with their predecessors, a reflection of the difficulties
associated with presenting such topics in a traditional book format.
Nonetheless, each provides a useful starting point and numerous sources of
further information. The book also contains three Appendices: useful
mathematical formulae, a brief crystallographic dictionary and the answers
to Exercises present at the end of each chapter. Inclusion of the Exercises,
no doubt remembered with affection by past students of the Course, is most
welcome. I suspect that they may find extensive use in lecture courses - I
am aware of at least one where that is already the case!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is of course no question that the book is a
valuable addition to the crystallographic literature, and it succeeds in
communicating to the reader the extensive knowledge and experience of the
authors. The chapters have been admirably edited into a coherent whole that
provides an informative and enjoyable account of the practical aspects of
the subject. Available initially only in hardback, the price may be
intimidating to the average student, but the paperback release should be
eagerly anticipated.</P>

<P>It is probably best to start this review by declaring some American style
First Amendment rights, in that the following is only the personal opinions
of an individual reviewer.  A reviewer who was less irritated by the
promotional blurb and extremely high price would no doubt have very
different options, and thus provide a very different review. </P>

<P>This book on structure determination from powder diffraction data is a
worthy kindred spirit to the Rietveld book edited by Ray Young and published
in 1995, both of which are part of the same series of IUCr Monographs on
Crystallography.  With the exceptions of peak profiling to obtain peak
positions prior to indexing, a chapter on solving structures under extreme
conditions, and information relating to structure validation and
publication, there is a good spread of relevant topics.  Examples of this
are the inclusion of chapters on sample preparation and data collection, and
using chemical information and intuition in solving structures from powders. 
However, it is disappointing there are no contributions by G.S. Pawley and
Armel Le Bail, even if only in the form of reminiscences.  It is their
seminal contributions (Pawley in 1981 and Le Bail in 1988) that allowed
solving structures from powder diffraction to start reaching escape
velocity.  Thanks also goes to Jeremy Cockcroft for observing that while
crystallographers can now calculate the odds of solving structures from real
space methods, they are not yet able to calculate the odds of the UK
National Lottery (page 259): the real answer is 49!/(6!*(49-6)!) [1 in
13,983,816].  The reviewer would also be interested to hear if there are
IUCr or OUP publishing policies relating to where possible conflicts of
interest by authors need to be declared up front: for example, two of the
authors already have a &quot;software patent&quot; that seems related to
some of the ideas and information in the text (see International patent
WO9906824 titled &quot;Method and apparatus for determining molecular
crystal structures&quot; - 
http://l2.espacenet.com/espacenet/viewer?PN=WO9906824&amp;CY=ep&amp;
LG=en&amp;DB=EPD). 
 Overall, there is nothing in the text itself to stop this
becoming a standard text on crystallographers' shelves for the foreseeable
future.</P>

<P>What might be considered a minor problem to some, though a major issue to
this reviewer, is that of the book's blurb and the publisher's promotional
webpages which give the impression that it is appropriate for guiding
(http://www.oup-usa.org/isbn/0198500912.html) and 

http://www.oup.co.uk/isbn/0-19-850091-2
).  While appropriate and useful for experts and those
seriously involved in powder diffraction, this text is not appropriate for
guiding novices.  Using the "Crystal Structure Determination" book my W.
Massa as a benchmark text for comparison, the SDPD book suffers from having
separate chapters written by separate authors.  The reviewer cannot think of
any text where sets of authors writing separate chapters has made a good
teaching text or guide to novices.  The quantity and quality of "hints" and
useful rules of thumb vary from chapter to chapter.  There is also no
"novice friendly" worked example as available in the Massa book.  </P>

<P>Furthermore, given the importance of software programs in a
crystallographic text of this type, many of the chapters give the impression
of being quite insular in not referring to any real world software tools. 
Some of these unmentioned programs are highly conspicuous by their absence,
which a novice reader may not realise.  Some chapters concentrate on the
attributes of a certain software package, while others seem oblivious to
available software.  The most striking example of this is in the chapter on
Le Bail and Pawley extraction which concludes: "well-developed computer
programs based upon the Le Bail and Pawley methods are available for
extracting integrated intensities from powder diffraction data".  Yet it
does not name any such programs or provide a relevant software bibliography
and Internet resource list.  There is also no helpful technical comparison
between programs that novices would find helpful.  The chapters on applying
Patterson methods to extracted hkl data, while including references to
SHELX, exclude any reference to DIRDIF (<A
HREF="http://www-xtal.sci.kun.nl/xtal/documents/software/dirdif.html">
http://www-xtal.sci.kun.nl/xtal/documents/software/dirdif.html</A>
) and PATSEE (
<A HREF="http://www.org.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de/egert/html/patsee.html">
http://www.org.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de/egert/html/patsee.html</A>).  This is despite at least one publication (uncited in the
book) showing PATSEE to be effective in this role (Acta Cryst. A56
(Supplement), s24, 2000).  Direct references to some important real-space
programs are missing.  These include ESPOIR by A. Le Bail (</FONT><A
HREF="http://www.cristal.org/"><FONT
FACE="Arial">http://www.cristal.org/</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">); FOX by
V. Favre-Nicolin and R. Cerny (</FONT><A
HREF="http://objcryst.sourceforge.net/"><FONT
FACE="Arial">http://objcryst.sourceforge.net/</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">)
and ZEFSAII by M. Deem et al (</FONT><A
HREF="http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/zefsaII/"><FONT
FACE="Arial">http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/zefsaII/</FONT></A><FONT
FACE="Arial">).  This is further compounded by an appendix listing of
computer programs that is very incomplete and strangely not Internet aware. 
Given that programs can date or change quickly, there are also no general
guides or advice in the Software Bibliography to assist the reader on
building up a modern, relevant software toolset (e.g., using the IUCr's
Crystallography World Wide or the IUCr's Sincris facility). These omissions
may not seem that significant to those experienced in the field, but would
be significant to novice readers. </P>

<P>Again, none of the above is fatal to this book becoming a standard text
in powder diffraction for the foreseeable future. It is, however, my opinion
that at £70, the cost is excessive. The pricing goes against technological
advances in publishing that, in theory, should make this type of book
cheaper, not priced in the stratosphere.  To the young and impressionable,
pricing of this type might in their minds justify the illegal use of a
photocopier to make personal copies.  An alternative for potential readers,
institutes and libraries would be to make use of the Internet to find
relevant up to date information on this topic.  This Internet available
information is plentiful (such as Armel Le Bail's website at </FONT><A
HREF="http://www.cristal.org/"><FONT
FACE="Arial">http://www.cristal.org</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">; the
IUCr's Crystallography World Wide / Sincris at </FONT><A
HREF="http://www.iucr.org/"><FONT

</FONT><A HREF="http://www.yahoogroups.com/list/sdpd/"><FONT
FACE="Arial">http://www.yahoogroups.com/list/sdpd/</FONT></A><FONT
FACE="Arial">).  A revised price based in the reality of what is affordable
to academics and students in both the developed and developing world might
redeem this book and assist it in becoming a standard text in powder
diffraction. </P>

<P>EMAG conferences are biennial events organised by the Electron Microscopy
and Analysis Group of the Institute of Physics in the UK. This volume is a
conference proceedings arising from such a meeting in Dundee in 2001. 'Not
much here for the crystallographer', I can hear you say, and in one sense
you would be right - the book is hardly awash with crystal structures (I
counted one in the entire volume), and most of the work is involved with the
analysis of high resolution electron microscopy images and related methods.
But, and it is an important 'but', as crystallographers deal with ever
smaller crystalline samples, it is useful to have a current window on the
world of nano-crystallography and associated materials, even within all the
expected limitations of a book of conference proceedings based on electron
microscopy.  </P>

<P>There are 128 contributions in 11 sections; each contribution takes 4
pages. The ones that may interest crystallographers most are those on HREM
and Electron Crystallography;  Ferrous Metals and Intermetallics; Carbons,
Ceramics and Composites; Catalysts, Sensors and Environmental Materials and
Semiconductors, Superconductors and Magnetic Materials. This is more than
half the book, although it must be said that the crystallography is
dominated by HREM.  There is also lot of  material on EELS spectroscopy, and
elemental mapping. In this context, I especially enjoyed a paper by Pike et
al. on 'A Microscopy Station for Mars'. What about an X-ray diffractometer
for Mars? - that would be exciting! Theory is not forgotten either: there
are papers on image processing, image analysis, exit wave reconstructions in
the electron microscope and tomography. Unlike many books of this sort,
there is a uniformity of presentation that makes it easy to browse.</P>

<P>The crunch is: would I buy my own copy? The answer is 'no', but I might
just persuade the university library to buy one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Valence bond and <I>ab initio</I> molecular orbital
theories were both developed in the 1920’s, but as the former is not so
amenable for calculation of large molecules, molecular orbital theory has
come to dominate the field. There are several problems, however, such as
bond breaking/making or interpretation of molecular orbital plots, where
valence bond theory has been shown to be the more appropriate method. It is
therefore important that researchers and students of computational chemistry
are aware of this alternative method. </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gallup’s book follows the tried and tested format for
computational chemistry texts: part I is devoted to a discussion of the
basic theory, whilst part II focuses on case studies for sets of related
molecules. In addition the text also advertises the freeware program CRUNCH,
available from the author’s website, from which most of the calculation
results highlighted in the text were obtained. </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of valence bond theory is comprehensively
set out, starting with a general discussion on Schrodinger's equation,
before moving on to the Heitler-London function and its subsequent
extensions, and ending with the theory behind multi-configuration valence
bond calculations. The hydrogen molecule is used as a simple two-electron
illustration for many of the principles highlighted in the text. Special
consideration is then paid to the treatment of three-electron doublet
states, before an account of advanced methods, which are suitable for
application to larger molecules, is presented. This section of the book also
includes an extensive discussion on the symmetry grouping of wavefunctions.
The author, however, does not give any indication of how large a ‘large
molecule’ is or state how the calculations scale with e.g. basis set
description or the number of electronic configurations included in the
calculation. The reader is thus left a little in limbo to know how tractable
this style of calculation will be for a particular application they may have
in mind. </P>


<P>The case studies presented in part II begin with four simple
three-electron systems: the allyl radical, [He<SUB>2</SUB>]<SUP>+</SUP>, the
valence orbitals of BeH and the Li atom. The reader is guided through
multi-configurational and other valence bond theory methods, and for each
system a consideration of the accuracy of the calculation (in terms of
dissociation energies, geometries, vibrational frequencies, dipole moments,
and energies) is discussed. The next set of compounds presented are the
homonuclear diatomic molecules of the second row of the periodic table,
before considering a set of isoelectronic second row heternuclear diatomics.
The remainder of the book then focuses on organic examples, including small
hydrocarbons, ring and aromatic compounds. Special consideration is given to
the nature of resonance in benzene, which is perhaps the most well known
example of where valence bond theory (supporting the Kekule/Dewar model)
rates higher than molecular orbital theory (supporting the delocalised
model). </P>


<P>In short, this book provides a comprehensive introduction to valence bond
methods, and the complexity of equations presented is not too daunting for
the mathematically timid.  </P>
