CD-ROM review - Crystallographic Space Group Diagrams and Tables'<BR>
</B>
<HR>
<P>CD-ROM compiled by Jeremy K. Cockcroft, Dept of Crystallography, Birkbeck College. <BR>
Written in html and conforms to the ISO9660 format. <BR>
Release date 5th August 1999. Price &pound;9.95. <a href="#sbbk">Sales info.</a></P>

I have always dreamed of owning a full set of Encyclopaedia Britannica.
However, just as this seemed to be within my grasp, thirty two expensive
volumes of gold-embossed leather were replaced by a thin (considerably
cheaper) plastic box containing a couple of CDs. If there is any printed
medium that has been revolutionised by the advent of the CD it is reference
books such as encyclopaedias and dictionaries. And our community's
equivalent - the spacegroup symmetry Tables - is no exception. The Tables
were a prime candidate for transfer to CD, and Jeremy Cockcroft of Birkbeck
College is to be congratulated for compiling this exceptional product at the
extremely attractive price of &pound;9.95.

<P>
The CD is written in html and will run on many different platforms via a web
browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. A screen resolution of
1280x1024 or 1024x768 is required. Starting the CD is as simple as inserting
it into your computer and opening the menu file using the browser.

The CD contains the diagrams of the standard settings of all 230
spacegroups, as well as their symmetry operators and general reflection
conditions. However, and extremely usefully for those of us who have
struggled with this in the past, the CD also contains the same information
for all possible alternative settings of axes, different choices of origin
(10 are given for spacegroup I4<SUB>1</SUB>/a!), enlarged C- and F-centred
tetragonal cells, and R- and H- settings for trigonal systems. In addition,
a simple click on the monoclinic spacegroup diagrams allows one to view them
perpendicular to the unique axis. Each spacegroup diagram can be used
(without permission) to other documents as high-resolution bitmaps, and the
symmetry operators can be easily cut and pasted into other crystallographic
software. A price reduction is available for bulk orders.

<P>
Despite the great deal of information contained on this CD, it would appear
to still have a considerable amount of free space. The scope for adding
additional information is thus huge. The equivalent Schoeflies symbols for
each spacegroup would be useful, as would the subgroup/supergroup
information contained in the current printed Tables. In a CD version,
hyperlinks would enable one to move directly between the equivalently
oriented spacegroups. For each spacegroup it would be extremely useful to
have the special positions in each spacegroup setting, their Wyckoff
symbols, multiplicities and the additional systematic absences they produce.
And there is scope for reintroducing the structure factor equations omitted
the most recent printed version of the Tables. However, I am sure the
authors have thought of these and many other additions, and their omission
in this version takes nothing from it.

<P>
So do I use this CD? Well, for spacegroup determination via systematic
absences, and for finding simple information on standard settings of
frequently used spacegroups I still instinctively reach for my battered
printed version of the Tables. However, for any work involving non-standard
settings or different origin choices, as frequently encountered when looking
at subgroup/supergroup relationships, or for instructing students on the
intricacies of origin shifts and axis permutations, this CD is a clear first
choice. And in the future, with the CD's almost infinite capacity for
holding additional information, I can see my printed Tables spending much
more time in the bookcase. I recommend this CD to everyone without
reservation.
