<P>
One trepidation about writing a review on the English edition of Werner
Massa's "Crystal Structure Determination"  is that it cannot do justice to
the conciseness and clarity of this highly useful single-crystal
crystallographic text.  It not only provides a very clear exposition of
crystallographic theory, but also the practise and "real world" tricks,
hints and expectations of what is possible. Starting with the
crystallographic theory (and various tricks and limitations of the method);
it continues onto experimental methods (including the growing of crystals);
mounting and indexing the cell;  structure solution; structure refinement;
additional topics such as absolute structure, extinction and the lambda/2
effect, etc; errors and pitfalls, disorder, false unit cells, twinning,
false spacegroups, misplaced origins, etc; interpretation and presentation
of results; crystal structure databases; and finally a worked structure
solution using SHELX.

<P>
While some crystallographers might put the charge of "corrupting the youth"
on the author by his emphasizing the use of F-square intensity data over F's
for structure solution and refinement; there is almost nothing significant
on which to try and condemn this book.  It is excellent. Though trying to
find some criticisms; an extra emphasis on the use of CCD diffractometers
and the various practical pitfalls and tricks of the trade in using CCD
instruments would be useful. Another addition could be to point out the
quite sophisticated automatic validation options in CIFCHECK as well as
Platon, and how to interpret and make use of the validation output
(different alert levels, A, B and C).  Given the usefulness of the Worked
Example of solving and refining a  structure using SHELX, it could be nice
to have worked examples of other  programs showing their different
approaches and advantages - but this is a personal and probably unimportant
comment.

<P>
Another issue is that of the price. At &pound;24.00 EUR 39.95, it is
affordable by individuals (though half that cost would probably be nicer for
the student budget). This price compares in a favourable manner to recent
trends in published scientific texts that have the apparent primary aim of
being a rip-off, rather that a useful scientific text deserving of being
read. A possible equivalent of the Massa book in the powder diffraction
field is priced at well over US$ 100.00; with the added disadvantage of not
having the conciseness, coherancy and clarity that a single author like
Massa should allow. The Massa book on Crystal Structure Determination is
highly useful. Unlike other emerging scientific and crystallographic texts,
it is priced in an affordable range making it easily available to anyone
involved in performing crystallography using single crystal methods. 

<P>
As it is reported there is a 2nd German edition of this text in print,
assuming it builds on the high quality of the first edition, it would be of
major benefit to see this new edition translated into English (and other
languages).  This would not only benefit crystallographic teaching and
education, but also people such as synthetic chemists and solid state
chemists who use crystallography as a "part time" tool; and do not have
access to formal crystallographic teaching courses.

<em>Title:</em> <B> "Symmetry 2000" </B><BR>
Proceedings from a symposium held  in Stockholm September 2000. <BR>
 Volume 80 of the Wenner-Gren International Series<BR>
<em>Editors:  </em>I. Hargittai, T.C.Laurent<BR>
<em>Publisher: </em>  Portland Press Ltd, London 2002 UK price  &pound;110 ( hardback bound in 2 parts) <BR>
<em>ISBN  1 85578 149 2 </em>  Vol 1 p 1 - 328, Vol 2  p 329 - 627 pages   
<P>
This symposium had three inter-related aims:  (i) to demonstrate the use of
the concept of symmetry in diverse fields, and to think of future
applications (ii) to encourage inter-disciplinary dialogue between those
using symmetry (iii) to identify the potential of the concept of symmetry in
general education and in the public understanding of science.  Most of the
articles were presented at the symposium, but the editors have also included
a few from other contributors which help to fulfil their aims.  This is not
a textbook where one chapter follows logically from the next, instead the 52
individual articles are grouped into like topics in six sections; in part
1,<em> Shapes and fractals</em>, <em>Properties and regularities</em>,
<em>Symmetries and chiralities</em> and in part 2 <em>Molecules and
assemblies</em>,  <em>Social culture</em>, <em>Artistic symmetry</em>. 
Notes and references for each article are printed at the end of the article.
The contents of both parts are printed in both volumes, the subject index
only at the end of  the second part. 

<P>
There is plenty here to interest a crystallographer; articles written by
acknowledged experts in their fields include that by Alan Mackay "<em>The
shape of two dimensional space"</em>,  and that by Jack Dunitz, <em>"Space
filling in molecular crystals". "Crystal optics and the symmetry principle:
an update"</em>  has a summary by W. Kaminsky and B.Kahr of the history of
optical rotation in crystals. There are several articles on symmetry
concepts in NMR Spectroscopy including "<em>Seven-fold dynamical symmetry in
solid-state NMR" </em>by M.Levitt who has been studying the detailed
geometric structure of rhodospin before and after absorbing light.  Perhaps
the most fundamental concepts are those described by D.Rouvray in
<em>"Symmetry in Action: the laws of Nature"</em>  which includes a summary
of the work of William Hamilton and Emmy Noether"s theorem relating
symmetries to conservation laws in chemistry.

<P>
Those interested in geometrical shapes will enjoy H.S.M.Coxeter"s <em>"The
rhombic triacontahedron"</em>,  or M Longuet-Higgins" <em>"On the use of
symmetry for constructing polyhedral models"</em> or the summary by
I.Bergstrom and S. Frefert  <em>"On the origins of the Platonic bodies and
some of their relatives"</em> which discusses how the recent discovery of
C<SUB>60</SUB>, which has the form of a truncated icosahedron, one of the
Archimedean solids, has prompted a renewed interest in polyhedral forms.  
Marjorie Senechal contributes <em>"Reflections on the Kaleidoscope"</em>,
Benoit Mandelbrot  "<em>Symmetry by dilation, reduction, fractals and
roughness" </em>and Doris Schattschneider <em>"The many faces of symmetry in
the work of M.C.Escher".</em>

<P>
The inter disciplinary nature of the books means that you may be able to
persuade your University Library to buy it since there are articles of
interest to historians, artists, students of foreign cultures and
information technology as well as mathematicians and scientists.   P.Gerdes
writes on symmetry in African cultures,  T Kobayashi on "<em>What was known
about the polyhedra in Ancient China and Edo Japan</em>"  where he describes
early seventeenth century texts on the Platonic and Archimedean solids,  but
failed to look closely at the lion dogs which guard Chinese temples; some of
these sculptures date from the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644) . While visiting
the IUCr Congress in Beijing in 1993, I. Hargittai photographed the ball
held in the claw of one of the lion dogs and saw that it resembled a "bucky
ball", (see<em>"The Crystallographic Tourist".</em> page 50 "Crystallography
news"  No 63 December 1997.) Those who attended the IUCr Congress in Glasgow
will have seen the textile exhibition organised by Annegret Haake on
crystallographic themes and be interested in her description of how it
started, "<em>XX-TEX - textiles and crystallography". </em> I also liked
J.Beyers" <em>"Symmetry concepts in quilt and fabric design"</em>, but I am
not sure whether to take seriously <em>"The songs of the double helix:
symmetry and lyrical conceptualism"</em>, where Paul Hartel quotes Kepler"s
"Harmonica Mundi" of 1618 describing the music of the spheres,  the sun and
planets which he associated with the geometrical forms of the 5 Platonic
solids. Hartel thinks that music is embedded within the essential building
blocks of DNA; some composers have assigned musical notes to DNA"s
constituent molecules and found that members of the audience likened the
resulting melodies to little known works by Bach, Brahms or Chopin! 
Students having difficulty in understanding the concept of symmetry in
introductory crystallography courses may find it helpful to read some of the
papers in the "Social Culture" and "Artistic Symmetry"  sections.

<P>
I found these volumes fascinating with their interesting mix of articles
showing many aspects of symmetry in our culture. However, they are
expensive, costing more than many hardback textbooks,  so I doubt whether
University Research Groups can afford them. Try to persuade your University
Library to buy them and then take them out on permanent loan.

<em>Title:</em> <B> "The Road to Stockholm. 
Nobel Prizes, Science, and Scientists"</B><BR>
<em>Author:</em>  Istv&aacute;n Hargittai<BR>
<em>Publisher: </em>  Oxford University Press 28 March 2002 UK price  &pound;19.99 (hardback) <BR>

<P>
The year 2001 was the centennial of the first award of the Nobel prizes.
They remain the only science prizes widely recognized by the general public
and the media; for a few days each Autumn there is international and local
news, sports news and <B><em>science news</em> </B>when the achievements of
the year"s Nobel Laureates are acclaimed. There are many other science
prizes, how has this one captured the public attention? Have you ever
wondered how the selection process works? Or whether the award of this prize
changes the lives of those who receive it?  Istv&aacute;n Hargittai has
thought about this for some years; he has interviewed  some 70 Nobel
Laureates and other distinguished scientists in the fields of "chemistry",
"physics", and "physiology and medicine" and distilled his findings into
this book, where he explores the answers to these questions.  This book is
not concerned with the Prizes in economics and literature and although the
title includes the word "science", this is incidental to the sociology,
these people happened to be scientists; the author has sensibly refrained
from trying to describe the science itself in detail, that would have made a
much longer book.  If you want to learn more of the science there are
copious references in the Notes section which is almost 50 pages long; I
expect that most BCA members will already be familiar with the science.  

<P>
The first chapter explains the history of the Nobel Prizes and the annual
selection process and mentions other science prizes,  including the "reverse
Nobel prize"  known as the "<em>Ig Nobel prize</em>" bestowed by the
<em>Annals of Improbable Research </em>on individuals whose "achievements
cannot or should not be reproduced".

<P>
The next chapter<B> "Nobel prizes and National Politics"</B> explores the
distribution of prizes  amongst scientists of various nationalities. One
problem is that the scientists themselves are more often citizens of the
world than of any one country, and may not themselves have the aspirations
attributed to them by others. We read (p 29) that Boris Vashtein, evaluating
the life and work of Dorothy Hodgkin, noted that she "<em>has done much for
the glory of her homeland</em>". As Hargittai remarks "<em>This reflected
more Vashtein"s way of thinking than Hodgkin"s aspirations</em>". 
Scientists naturally migrate to other countries even in peace time, and in
the 1930s many who later became Nobel Laureates fled Nazi Germany. The small
number of prizes for Japanese scientists may also be an indication of the
timidity of Western Science towards Japan. We see this also in the IUCr
where an excellent Japanese bid to host the 2005 Congress was rejected in
favour of one from Florence.

<P>
<B>"Who wins Nobel prizes?" </B>is the question posed in the third
chapter<B>. </B>The author tries to assess the common qualities which Nobel
laureates possess, and speculates on whether it may be possible to train
people to become Prize winners.  A later chapter on<B> "Mentors"
</B>describes how students naturally wish to work with inspiring eminent
scientists who may later win Nobel prizes; some famous examples are
Frederick Sanger (winner of the Chemistry prize in 1958 and again in 1980)
and his research student C&eacute;sar Milstein who won one in medicine in
1984.  

<P>
	Equally interesting is the last chapter,<B> "Who did not win?",</B> where
possible reasons are discussed as to why those who surely deserved  a Nobel
prize did not receive one.     J.D.Bernal is  perhaps the most notable
crystallographer; another example is Isabella Karle, who played a
significant role in putting the direct method into practice but was not
awarded the Nobel prize with Herbert Hauptmann and Jerome Karle in 1985. 
She was given the Swedish Aminoff prize for crystallography in 1992.  There
are also some important newly discovered topics such as "quasi-crystals"
whose discoverers have not  yet  received a Nobel Prize.  Dan Shectmann 
received the Aminoff Prize  for his discovery of quasi-crystals in 2000.
Hargittai speculates that the Aminoff Prize may be becoming a "consolation
prize" for those not awarded a Nobel prize.  
 
<P>
The book lists the Nobel Prizes awarded in scientific fields up to 2001; it
has an index to the names of the scientists but <em>no subject index</em>.
This would have made it a much better reference tool for those who wonder
which important scientific discoveries have been awarded a Nobel prize. 
Nevertheless, the book is very good value for money, a well produced
hardback for just under &pound;20, but the publisher saved money by binding
all the photographs together in one place, I would have preferred them
distributed throughout the text.  If you are interested in the history and
sociology of science or just wondering how to groom your students to become
future Nobel prizewinners buy this book.

<h3>Addenda to the above review</h3>
<p>
These notes were made up from comments received on the book review and

<p>
I was pleased to receive more historical details about Fred Sanger as a
'Mentor' from John Walker; Fred fostered the research of several other Nobel
prizewinners in addition to Cesar Milstein.</p>
<p><em>
"Cesar Milstein did his PhD in the Department of Biochemistry in Cambridge 
studying enzymes under I think Malcolm Dixon; Fred Sanger was in that
Department at the same time but Cesar was not his  student. Cesar then
returned to Argentina and was encouraged by Fred to return to Cambridge
after a gap of a year or so to work on  antibodies.  He carried out this
work independently at the  LMB in The  Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry
Division of which Fred was the first Head after the opening of the LMB in
the early 1960s. Later, when Fred  retired, Cesar succeeded him as
Divisional Head.<br><br>

Without any doubt, Fred's most famous PhD student  was Rodney Porter who 
won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1972 with Gerald Edelman 
"For their discoveries concerning the chemical structure of antibodies".<br><br>

Other Laureates directly associated with and influenced by Fred were Mike 
Smith and myself. Mike spent a sabbatical year in Fred's Division at the 
LMB from 1974-1975, working in Fred's group to determine the first 
extensive DNA sequences. During this period, Mike developed his ideas with 
Clyde Hutchison III about using oligonucleotides for site directed 
mutagenesis, the discovery for which Mike received the Chemistry Prize in 
1992.  I joined Fred's Division in 1974.  I worked with him and his group 
on the first proteomics projects designed to understand by protein chemical 
methods the meaning of the first complete DNA genomes, those in 
bacteriophages phiX174 and G4 and later of the mitochondrial genome which 
Fred had also sequenced.  During the latter work, in the late 1970s, I 
developed an interest in oxidative phosphorylation and particularly in ATP 
synthase. Fred encouraged me to work on ATP synthase."</em></p>
<p>
Istvan Hargittai has also sent a few more comments on 'mentoring'<br><br>
<em>
"I had a lot of conversation with Cesar Milstein in addition to what
appeared  in 'Candid Science: Conversations with Famous Biomedical
Scientists.'  Imperial College Press, London, 2002.  We spent three months
at LMB at the beginning of 2000 and we hit it off well. Cesar talked to me a
lot about Sanger's impact on him and he did call Sanger his teacher (an
inspiring  teacher, he called him in the published interview). It is curious
that he never mentioned the person under whom he did do his PhD and I really
don't know why not.<br><br>

 As I discuss in the book, to be a mentor the person need not be a formal
supervisor, a mentor may be a teacher, may even be a person in the
literature."</em><br><br></p>

<B>The Chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry: The Bond Valence Model</B>

Although the idea of the chemical bond is of some importance in chemistry,
it has proved to be difficult to describe quantum mechanically.  As Brown
puts it on the first page of this excellent book, <I>it is unlikely that,
left to themselves, theoretical chemists in the twentieth century would ever
have created the idea of the chemical bond had not the concept already been
central to the language of structural chemistry</I>.   Thank goodness for
the Victorians.

<P>
 The bond valence method, which has been developed in large part by the
author of this book, exploits the essential simplicity of the traditional
bonding model in which an atom has a certain bonding capacity (valence)
which is shared over the bonds that it forms.  By drawing on the wealth of
structural data which has become available as a result of the developments
in crystallography over the twentieth century it has enabled an empirical
relationship to be established between the length of a bond and the number
if valence units that the bond contributes.  It therefore forms a
quantitative theory of chemical structure, which though most frequently
applied to ionic solids, can be applied equally well to covalent compounds
and to liquids.  The beauty of the method is that it does this without
recourse to lengthy calculations.

<P>
After a brief historical survey given in Chapter 1, Chapters 2 and 3
examine the theoretical basis of the bond valence method. It is possible to
calculate the Madelung or electrostatic field of an ionic crystal, and the
collection of all the lines of field joining two charges forms the bond
between them.  The strength of the bond is characterised by the
electrostatic flux.  This procedure clearly requires extensive calculation,
but fortunately the bond fluxes are generally the same as experimental bond
valences (<I>S</I><SUB>ij</SUB>), derived from crystallographically
determined interatomic distances (<I>R<SUB>ij</SUB></I>)<I> </I>using
Brown's famous equation:

<center>
<IMG src="sep024.gif" ALT="Brown's equation" HEIGHT=47 WIDTH=118 VSPACE=2>

<I>R</I><SUB>o</SUB> and <I>B</I> are characteristic of a particular bond
type; a tabulation is available at

http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-mirrors/i_d_brown/bond_valence_parm/</A>.

<P>
Chapter 4 examines the concept of cation and anion bonding strength and the
<I>valence matching principle</I>, which states that the most stable
compounds are formed between cation and anions with similar bonding
strengths. Chemists will recognise the similarity of this principle to
Pearson's hard and soft acid and base principle, and the relationship
between the two is discussed.  The nice thing about bonding strengths is
that they easily calculated and they explain a lot. For example in
PO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>3- </SUP>the valence of the central atom is 5, that of
oxygen is 2.  Each P-O bond must have a valence of 5/4=1.25 to satisfy the
phosphorus, leaving the oxygen 0.75 valence units (v.u.) for external
bonding - for example to a counter-cation.  Generally oxygen forms four
bonds; one of these is to the phosphorus, and so that each external bond
will be worth 0.25 v.u, the anion bonding strength of phosphate. Phosphate
is a stronger anion than sulfate, which has a strength of 0.17 v.u.  In
these few lines lies the explanation for the differences between phosphate
and sulfate chemistry.  The idea is developed in the following chapter into
a discussion of solubilities and the formation of secondary solvation shells
in aqueous solution.  There is a short, but interesting, section on
silicates.  Magmas which are rich in magnesium (strength 0.33) tend to
crystallise as Mg<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB> because
SiO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP> also has a strength of 0.33.  Magmas rich in
weaker sodium (strength 0.17) tend to form
Na<SUB>2</SUB>Si<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> because the strength of the
Si<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> anion is 0.17.  The book is full of
'nice' illustrations like this.

<P>
Chapter 6 examines the influence of anion-anion repulsion and
cation-to-anion bonding strength as factors which determine the
co-ordination numbers of cations.  A discussion of hydrogen bonds, that is
the structural chemistry of the H<SUP>+</SUP> cation, is given in Chapter 7,
and their somewhat anomalous properties shown, as a development of the
material presented in the previous chapter, to be a result of anion-anion
repulsions.  Madelung fields have been calculated explicitly only for
symmetrical structures, and Chapter 8 tackles the problem of distorted
structures, and how a local polarisation model can be used to interpret
them.  For example, cations such as Tl<SUP>+</SUP> can form stable compounds
with anions with varying bonding strengths, and this can be related to the
polarisation of its lone pair of electrons.  The oddly distorted structures
of <I>d</I><SUP>0 </SUP>transition metal complex can be addressed with a
similar model.  Chapter 9 brings the section of the book devoted to
fundamental chemical principles to a close with a review of the properties
of bonds, such as bond lengths and angles, force constants and their
response to temperature.

<P>
The next section of the book concentrates of the general theme of the
structures of  inorganic solids.  There is a need to satisfy both chemical
and symmetry constraints when compounds form crystals, and the first chapter
of this section (10) gives a brief introduction to space group theory. In
addition to the two methods described above, bond valences may also be
calculated from a bonding graph in the absence of experimental information
from the requirement that the sum of the valences of the bonds made to a
particular atom must equal the atomic valence of that atom.  Thus, in the
case of NaCl, where each cation and anion forms six bonds, each bond must be
equivalent to 0.17 valence units.  Where symmetry is lower non-equivalent
bonds have different valences, and so this constraint is usually not enough
to form a tractable set of simultaneous equations. In these cases a valence
is considered to be positive in the direction anion to cation, and a further
equations are added using constraint that that the sum around a closed loop
must equal zero.  The application of these <I>theoretical bond valences</I>
to modelling crystal structures will be clear, and the approaches for
predicting topologies are described in Chapter 11.  The material covered
ranges more widely than the immediate application of the bond valence
method, and (for example) methods based on simulating annealing for crystal
structure prediction are also covered.   Structures in which experimentally
determined bond valences differ from the theoretical valences just described
are termed as being strained, and Chapter 12 examines this topic in detail.

<P>
The remainder of the book reviews applications of the bond valence method in
crystallography, chemistry, physics, mineralogy and biology.  A well known
crystallographic application is in the assignment of oxidation states, and
the calculation of the occupancies of Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> in
the octahedral and tetrahedral metal sites in Fe<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB> is
given as a specific example.  The final chapter attempts to place the bond
valence method into the context of other bonding theories.

Although there are several excellent reviews on the bond valence method in
the literature there has long been a need for a dedicated monograph on the
subject. This book will appeal to appeal to anyone interested in the
structure of solids, including crystallographers,  structural chemists and
materials scientists. Professor Brown has written a highly readable book
about a theory that, though it has long found application in inorganic
crystal chemistry,  deserves to be used more widely.  One needs only a
pencil and a calculator to use it, and having read the book, readers will be
inspired to apply this simple predictive theory to their own work.

Skipping through Brenda Maddox's new book on Rosalind Franklin is
thought-provoking on the history of  DNA structure determination. A
discarded title for 'The Double Helix' was apparently 'Base Pairs',
according to Brenda Maddox a punning self-accusation by Jim Watson that he
and Francis Crick had, without her knowledge, made use of Rosalind
Franklin's experimental fibre diffraction patterns.  


<P> If the fiftieth anniversary of the Watson-Crick model, looming in early
2003, provokes a new wave of interest in nucleic acid structure, alongside
the renewed interest in these old controversies, Stephen Neidle's excellent
new introductory textbook will prove to be very timely, and provides a calm,
balanced and objective study of the major advances. Practising scientists
are increasingly too busy for textbook writing, but nothing can replace the
perspective that someone of Steve's experience brings to this subject. The
book's predecessor, 'DNA Structure and Recognition' was published in 1994,
and for the last seven years has been my main introductory recommendation
for students of nucleic acid structure for its clarity, brevity and balance.
The new book incorporates all the major advances since then, and has the
added bonus of a website 
 (<A HREF="http://www.oup.com/na-structure">www.oup.com/na-structure</A>)  and
has free access even if you don't buy the book.<br>

<P> Chapter One describes methods for studying nucleic acid structure, with
a short discussion of the X-ray method, and  a quick look at n.m.r.,
molecular modelling methods and databases. Chapter Two is perhaps the most
immediately useful for a newcomer, a guide through the complexities of the
nomenclature used to describe nucleic acid structure and conformations
(slide, roll, twist, pucker, buckle, tilt, and the rest.....), which are
very confusing at first.  Chapter Three goes back to the original technique
used for studying DNA structure, fibre diffraction, and compares these
average results with the details available using single crystals. It is
striking that the originaltriplex, and Holliday junction DNA  (see picture),
all of these structures having resisted years of attempts to demonstrate
their crystallographic existence. DNA has the reputation of being difficult
to crystallise, because, unlike proteins, it is never globular and always
has the negative charge of the phosphates which must be neutralised with
cations, but (perhaps so as not to frighten newcomers?) this book makes no
direct mention of these problems. It is at this point that the use of the
pdb files on the website is particularly encouraged, because unlike the
double helix, readers won't be familiar with these recent exotica. (Note -
if you try this, the right hand mouse button is the key to unlocking some
very pretty and useful ways of viewing the molecules with Chime. Happy
viewing!). Chapter Five is an introduction to DNA interactions with small
molecules -  DNA crystals typically contain at least 50% water, much of
which is ordered into well-studied hydration patterns. Drug and cation
binding perturb this; a study of these interactions often suggesting modes
of DNA-protein interaction, the subject of Chapter Seven.

<P>
Chapter Six, though, is an important area which the predecessor book did not
cover (hence the change in title) - the RNA Structural World. The compact
tertiary structures of RNA are the closest analogues in the nucleic acid
field to the folding of globular proteins. We are fortunate that Venki
Ramakrishnan has very kindly accepted the BCA's invitation to give the Max
Perutz Memorial Lecture at the Spring Meeting in April 2003, when we hope to
be treated to a guided tour of the amazing complexity of the ribosome.
Meanwhile, this book includes a short and readable description, and the
webpage gives quick access to the ribosome coordinate files for an awesome
molecular experience  (and, yes, you can try this at home, even, I thought
the ribosome would crash my PC but it didn't!) - 'the ribosomal RNA
framework is likely to be largely invariant throughout the living world', as
the penultimate sentence of this excellent short summary puts it And with
that mind-boggling thought, let me congratulate Steve on making this subject
so accessible to such a potentially wide audience.

This compact and informative book begins with a quotation from Max Perutz to
whom the book is dedicated: ' The X-ray study of proteins is sometimes
regarded as an abstruse subject comprehensible only to specialists, but the
basic ideas underlying our work are so simple that some physicists find them
boring'

<P>
A major change in the area of  X-ray crystallography has been the invasion
of the field by biologists and biochemists who are prepared to have a go at
tackling 'their' protein without much formal training.  The daily
correspondence over the various e-mail bulletin boards provides a lively
record of hundreds of intrepid amateurs in laboratories round the world who
follow computational recipes and travel far down the sometimes tortuous
paths of structure determination.  This have-a-go approach should certainly
be encouraged and is undoubtedly contributing to the continued exponential
growth of protein structures now available - fast approaching the 20,000
mark.  

<P>
This book is therefore a very timely contribution as it provides newcomers
to the field of protein crystallography with a concise outline of the
background physics together with an overview of the practical aspects of
protein structure determination by crystallography.  David Blow is one of
the grand masters of protein crystallography and has made many major
contributions to the field ; notably in the original development of the
theory of molecular replacement and in pioneering work on the structure
determination of many key enzymes.  I was intrigued to see how someone with
such profound insight of the subject  would tackle the job of explaining the
theory and practise of this arcane art in less than 250 pages in a palatable
form suitable for biologists.


<P>
The chosen format is to divide the book into two equal halves in which the
first more theoretical part discusses crystal symmetry and the physics of
diffraction while the second part tackles the more practical steps covering
all stages from data collection to structure refinement.  It is also claimed
that the text is suitable for those with a minimal background in maths.  To
this end grey-shaded boxes are scattered through the text segregating out
algebraic formulae and theoretical explanations.  This seems like an
excellent idea.  To capture the full flavour of the book I read all the grey
boxes. In some chapters the approach works well and the thread of the
narrative text is maintained. In the chapters on Waves and Diffraction the
boxes dominate and this makes for a more patchy read.  The second half of
the book has excellent chapters on isomorphous replacement, anomalous
scattering and molecular replacement.  In all chapters in this section Blow
makes good use of well selected historical and recent papers to provide
examples of the procedures being described.  In such an all encompassing
book it is impossible to cover all definitions and there are a few places in
the book which may puzzle the true novice where terms like s (I), c* and
'phasing power' are introduced in the text without having been defined. 
Such pedantries should not however spoil enjoyment of the book and I can
warmly recommend it to novices and experts alike. 

<P>
With excitement still high about structural genomics, the future of protein
crystallography over the next decade is assured and is set to drift steadily
further away from the realms of physics into arms of the biologists.  Indeed
no crystallography laboratory can exist nowadays without strong biological
projects and the editors should perhaps consider a sister volume 'Molecular
Biology for Crystallographers and Bored Physicists'
