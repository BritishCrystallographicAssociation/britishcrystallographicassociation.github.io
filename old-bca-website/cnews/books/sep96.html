<h2><a name="coll">The Collected</a>
   Works of  DOROTHY CROWFOOT HODGKIN</h2>    
<p>
   Dorothy Hodgkin, who won the Nobel Prize in 1964 belongs to a small group
of scientists who changed the face of science - as will be  abundantly clear
from the papers in this collection. She is acknowledged as the leading
crystallographer in the field of natural products; she had an unerring
instinct for sensing the most significant structural problems in this field.
The landmarks of her work are cholesterol, penicillin, vitamin B12 and
insulin. 
<p>
   Through her numerous collaborators she has played a major part in the
spread of X-ray crystallography all over the world. She was a visiting Raman
Professor of the Indian Academy of Sciences. To commemorate this, the
Academy has published her collected works in three volumes, printed by
Interline Publishing, Bangalore. ISBN 81-7296-020-4
<p>
   The first volume contains all the papers Dorothy and her collaborators
have published on insulin from the first report of the X-ray photographs she
took in 1935 to the solving of its structure in 1969 and its final
refinement. It has vii + 635 pages.
<p>
    The second volume contains her papers
on cholesterol, penicillin and other antibiotics, and vitamin B12. It has lv
+ 762 pages.<p>
   The third contains her papers on general crystallography,
review articles, general articles on various topics and biographical
articles on the lives of prominent scientists. It also includes the
'Autobiographical Memoirs' of the early part of her life, edited by
Katherine Hodgkin.  It has lj + 816 pages.  
<p>  There are also review articles
on insulin, vitamin B12 and penicillin; reminiscences by those who knew her,
the addresses delivered at her funeral and memorial service, and major
lectures she delivered including the Nobel Lecture in 1964. Each volume has
subject and author indices. The editors are G.G. Dodson, J.P. Glusker,  S.
Ramaseshan,  K. Venkatesan.

This 3 volume set is being published by the Indian Academy of Sciences at
the price of £80 (including postage from India).  These
books make an invaluable resource for many purposes - including the
education of future crystallographers.  The low price brings them within the
sights of both individuals and libraries.  The sooner your library can be
persuaded to buy a copy, the more money it will save.
