<h2> High Resolution X-ray Diffractometry and Topography</h2>

<P>
<em>Title:  </em><strong>High Resolution X-ray Diffractometry and Topography
</strong><BR>
<em>Authors:</em>  D.K.Bowen, B.K.Tanner<BR>
<em>Publisher:  </em>Taylor and Francis, Jan 1998 <BR>
<em>ISBN</em> 0 85066 758 5  hardback     &pound;49.95   256 pages 
<P>
In the words of the authors, 'the purpose of the book is to provide the
theoretical and practical background necessary to the study of single
crystal materials by means of high resolution x-ray diffraction and
topography'; they superbly achieve that aim. The book is an excellent
combination of theoretical background and practical details. The book is
well illustrated throughout with clear figures and diagrams, and many
examples of data or meaningful simulations. There is sufficient theoretical
background for the book to appeal to researchers not directly involved in
the field, and so will be a value to a wide range of academic post-graduates
and industrial researchers. The book contains substantially more relevant
practical and experimental details, illustrated and supported well by real
examples, than one would normally expect to find. This is one of the books
real strengths. For me this justifies its publication and price, and
guarantees a broad appeal.</p>

<P>
There is an excellent chapter on X-ray scattering theory, and the chapter on
the simulation of x-ray diffraction rocking curves will be invaluable for
those wishing to pursue a detailed evaluation of their data. In the context
of the development of advanced materials and devices, the chapters on the
analysis of thin films and multiple layers, and of epitaxial layers are
particularly important. The description of high resolution x-ray diffraction
techniques is typically thorough, and contains much practical advice and
information.</p>

<P>
I am even less familiar with the field of X-ray topography, but the three
chapters on single and double crystal X-ray topography, and on synchrotron
radiation based X-ray topography very impressively demonstrate the power of
the technique for visualising strain distributions.</p>

<P>
The availability of advanced synchrotron radiation facilities does clearly
provide some impetus to the further development and utilisation of these
techniques. However, the authors do quite correctly stress that much of the
vital routine work can be done most effectively on modern laboratory based
sources.</p>

<P>
I have only one minor criticism. The comparison of radiation's for
diffraction in the introductory chapter rather downplays the potential and
the contribution of neutron diffraction. Although it is undoubtedly true
that you should always use x-rays in preference to neutrons if it is
appropriate, neutrons have and do play an important role in diffraction
studies.</p>

<P>
In summary, this is an excellent book  which is well written, contains a
wealth of practical details, a sound theoretical basis, and should appeal to
academic post-graduate and industrial scientists alike.</p>

<h2>Dignifying Science</h2>

<em>Title: </em><strong>Dignifying Science</strong><BR>
<em>Author:</em> Jim Ottaviani with various illustrators<BR>
<em>Publisher:</em> GT Labs, August 1999  paperback price US $ 16.95<BR>

G.T.Labs publish books about famous scientists in the format of a comic
strip.  They have published several other books, e.g. '<em>Safecracker. A
two fisted science comic</em> about some of the well documented exploits of
the physicist Richard Feynman. </p>

Although most of  the book is drawings, there is some text containing their
references and suggestions for further reading. There are also substantial
notes for each chapter.  They say in the preface  <em>'All the characters
and most of the likenesses in this book are based on historical figures, and
we've tried to give a realistic sense of their life and work. But though
based on fact this book is in equal measures history and historical fiction.
Real events interweave with those we imagined for dramatic purposes, and
documented quotes mix with our interpretations of thoughts and actions.'<BR>

The six scientists in this book are women;  the prologue shows us Marie
Skoldowska (later Curie) struggling to keep warm in Paris with a memorable
illustration of just one very small lump of coal left in her huge coal
scuttle. The others are Hedy Lamarr, Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin,
Barbara McClintock and Birut&eacute; Galdikas.  They all had a single minded
enthusiasm for their chosen science with differing problems to overcome in
order to be able to do their own research.  The only crystallographer is
Rosalind Franklin; her story is told by Madame Weil, a friend from the happy
days she spent working in Paris. Three different illustrators contribute
differing views of her work as seen by the three scientists Crick, Wilkins
and Watson during the time she was taking the early photographs of DNA 
which contributed to the discovery of its helical structure. </p>

This drawing (from page 65 ) shows Rosalind on a visit to Cambridge looking
critically at one of the early models made by Crick and Watson, who
initially built models based on geometry without fully considering the
chemical properties of the molecules.<BR>

<BR>
I enjoyed this book once I had overcome my astonishment that comic strips
can contain an accurate scientific message, and are not just depicting
fanciful science fiction.

G.T. Labs offer discounts to educators who buy five or more copies, so these
books may be an ideal way to introduce school children to the idea that
scientists are not a race apart but are just like other comic strip
personalities; further details can be found on their website at
