<I>Title:</I> <B>Direct Phasing in Crystallography: Fundamentals and Applications</B><BR>
<I>Author:</I> Carmelo Giacovazzo<BR>
<I>Publisher: </I>Oxford University Press,  November 1998      <BR>
                (International Union of Crystallography Monograph No 8)<BR>
ISBN 0-19-850072-6 Hardback &pound;75, 765 pages, 8 halftones, 226 line drawings.

<P>
This monograph is a very extensive book on Direct Methods (DM) for solving 
crystal structures and its applications to Structural Crystallography. It is
a major enterprise of Carmelo Giacovazzo and I am very glad he did the job
and the IUCr Book Series Committee decided to accept it for the IUCr
monograph series.

<P>
There are three parts: fundamentals, different applications and their
basics, and  recent results of DM in macromolecular problems. 
 Among other
topics included are: Wilson statistics, structure invariants and
semi-invariants, triplets, joint probability distributions, quartets,
quintets, one and two phase semi-invariants, neutron data, powder data,
macromolecular data, integration of macromolecular and direct methods, and
maximum entropy techniques. The monograph ends with more general appendices
including one on useful mathematical techniques, followed by 32 pages of
references and a 3-page index. The index is too short: I think a more
extensive index would have been appropriate for this impressive volume and
would also have made it more useful as a reference manual. Similarly, the
list of references should have been a reference and a name index, so that
all the relevant pages in the monograph could be found easily starting from
a reference. 

<P>
As may be expected, knowing the author's scientific work, his approach to DM
is firmly rooted in mathematics. Readers that do not share this mathematical
interest, or lack the required level in mathematics, may find some
difficulties in mastering the whole of this book. The author seems well
aware of this, so to retain the line of reasoning in each chapter more
specialized (mathematical) topics are dealt with in appendices.
Nevertheless, many readers will find this book to be a useful theoretical
guide while practising or undergoing local teaching in this field, when
becoming familiar with solving crystal structures by standard packages or
even when studying more complicated problems.

<P>
As a matter of course, there is criticism as well. Long ago I used to
finance part of my study by writing about sporting events for local
newspapers; I always compared my articles with those written by others in
competing newspapers. We seldom presented the same view on the same event.
This is also true of the present book; it is Carmelo Giacovazzo's view on
direct methods and as such primarily written on the basis of his own
experience and that of the Italian group around him, though with much
attention to all other developments in the field. I will illustrate this
with a few examples. In the first 4 sections of chapter 3 the Cochran
distribution for estimating triplet phase sums theoretically is introduced.
Although the triplet relation was implicitly present in earlier DM work,
Cochran first examined the relation explicitly in 1955. In this book the
first reference to Cochran (1955) does not occur until 6 pages from the
beginning of the section.   Another example <BR>

I would have presented differently is the quartet-story because right from
the beginning the negative quartet was apparent and published; I had solved
the first structure with the negative quartet criterion by the summer of
1973.

<P>
Then, at some place the author referred to a nice little article of Niek van 
der Putten, myself and George Tsoucaris about the extension of data beyond
the limiting sphere, which never got real applications as such. However,
another co-worker, Jouk Jansen, applied this idea of estimating intensities
by using quartets to assign intensities to individual reflections from
completely overlapping peaks in powder diagrams. Rietveld-like procedures
are not applicable to this sort of problem and thus Direct Methods reveal
additional information. This was a very promising application of the
original idea and as such  certainly suited for inclusion in chapter 13 of
the present monograph. 
 
<P>
<BR>
Another obvious omission is a reference to the first successful
determination of a non-centrosymmetric structure which was a landmark in DM 
history (Isabella L.Karle and Jerry Karle (1963), Acta Cryst. 16, 969).  A
final example is in the introduction to chapter 6, where a competing theory
is mentioned, ('the nested neighborhood principle' of Herbert Hauptman)
without describing the differences and similarities between these theories,
whereas in my opinion the two theories are not all that different. These are
a few examples, it is not difficult to find more, and I am only one of the
other scientists active in the same field.  

<P>
However, despite this criticism, Carmelo Giacovazzo did a great job in
putting  so much energy in such an extensive overview of a highly
interesting subject which after all these years is still one of the hottest
irons in the fire of  crystallography.

</FONT></I> <P>
   This is a fairly standard book about Group Theory and Representation
Theory.  Although the discussion starts from scratch, this is
<B><I>not</I></B> a book for undergraduates and should be considered as a
text for post-graduates or as a reference book.  The main difficulty with
group theory is its abstract mathematical nature with little or no immediate
relevance to science:  Lots of concepts are defined and used to investigate
small point groups but there are usually no `real' applications.  The nice
thing about this book is that the group theory is actually employed on some
real physical examples such as Buckminsterfullerene, C<SUB>60</SUB>.<BR>

The less appealing aspect to this book is its incomprehensibility.  Although
the information has been fairly carefully prepared, with only a few
typographical errors, a novice would <I>not</I> be able to generate the
detailed understanding of group theory and its applications as outlined.  An
elementary mathematical text would be required initially, which would
provide the concepts uncluttered with their applications, then this book
could be used as a reminder of these concepts together with some detailed
and complicated applications of the ideas.   

<P>
   The initial two chapters are particularly difficult.  They purport to
introduce vector-space ideas for use in representation theory, but in fact
are being used as a vehicle for some of the author's research ideas,
so-called <I>involutional transformations</I> and  <I>intertwining
matrices</I>}, which he feels  should have a central place in the field! 
Although these quantities are undoubtedly of use in various areas of
mathematical physics, it is bizarre to put them in the first two chapters
which are introducing basic fundamental concepts like a vector-space. Once
this foible has been passed, however, the book settles down to an excellent
discussion of basic group theory and how it is used and abused in science. 
The main thrust of the book is more towards physics than chemistry, which is
unusual since applications to molecules are so much simpler and easier to
understand, but this makes the book quite charming in a way The sections on
Dirac operators, Bucky-balls and Symmetry-adapted Linear combinations of
atomic orbitals, I personally found quite interesting. 
 
<P>
   One of the main themes of the book is to provide a complete, but
elementary, derivation of the 230 space-groups.  Although in principle this
has been done, sadly the theory is <I>not</I> elementary and any reader
expecting to be led to a simple understanding of: irreducible
representations, character tables, crystallographic notation, Lie groups and
the general class of space-groups, is going to have to work very hard indeed
to generate even a cursory understanding.  This book does have many positive
features: the desire to make physical applications a central part of the
development, the attempt to derive the space-groups from first principles
and the inclusion of quantities central to quantum-mechanics as the basic
building blocks.  Sadly, the book has equally many negative features.  The
notation is quite confusing, the level of sophistication is high and the
compatibility with other sources of reference is dubious.  The central place
for the author's personal foibles and the intertwining of elementary with
sophisticated ideas make the book difficult to read and highly non-trivial
to use.  In conclusion, this is an interesting and basically sound book with
a nice slant, but it is difficult to read and would best be used as an
additional source of reference in conjunct ion with other material.

This delightful collection of essays was written by Max Perutz over a period
of some thirty years. They are collected into four sections: 'Ploughshares
into Swords', 'How to make Discoveries', 'Rights and Wrongs' and 'More about
Discoveries'.  The essays in the first three sections were written mainly
for journals presupposing no scientific knowledge, those in the last section
are aimed at scientists.  Some are book reviews, others obituaries, (Linus
Pauling, Dorothy Hodgkin), most deal with some aspect of science or the
lives of scientists, including 'How W.L.Bragg invented X-ray diffraction' 
which was first published by the International Union of Crystallography. 
His 'Commonplace Book' is printed at the end; it is a collection of wise
sayings he has encountered and jotted down for future reference and
presented here for others to enjoy. For example, "<B><I>Everything is always
decided for reasons other than the real merits of the case</I></B>"  said by
Maynard Keynes about Lloyd George's government.  My own experience shows
this to be true and no doubt many BCA members will have similar memories.

<P>
Max Perutz needs little introduction to readers of this newsletter; born in
Austria, he came to Cambridge in 1936 to work for his PhD which he gained in
early 1940, shortly before being interned as an 'Enemy Alien', the title of
the essay which describes his subsequent adventures, including two voyages
across the Atlantic with hazardous German U boats. His English friends had
been horrified when he was interned and finally succeeded in persuading the
British Government to release him and allow him to use his scientific skills
on wartime projects, such as 'Habakkuk', a scheme to strengthen ice
sufficiently to enable icebergs to be used as floating landing strips to
allow airplanes to cross the Atlantic more easily. He was well qualified to
do this having done some work on the structure of glacial ice in his native
land.  His later research was on the structure of haemoglobin which led to
his receiving a Nobel prize in 1972 with John Kendrew.  He was formerly the
Chairman and is now a member of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge, England.

<P>
These essays describe the life and work of many famous scientists during the
past 100 years from Pasteur to Pauling.  The author was at the MRC during
the time of the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA.  He
recalls this in 'How the Secret of Life was Discovered'. Photographs of both
Watson and Crick are to be found in the 'Photo Gallery' together with those
of many other scientists, mainly biologists, but including others such as 
Fermi, Hahn, Meitner and Sakharov all of whom are the subjects of essays in
this book. 'Friend or Foe of Mankind' is a review of a biography of Fritz
Haber, a German chemist who gained fame by discovering how to synthesise
ammonia from air and infamy by introducing  'poison gas'  in the first World
War.  There are many other stories. This book is very easy to read and
liberally sprinkled with amusing anecdotes; I was fascinated to learn how
W.L.Bragg came to have a species of cuttlefish named after him.
