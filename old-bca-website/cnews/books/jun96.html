<h2><a name="bio">POSTGRADUATE</a> STUDY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES:</h2> 
<h2>A Researcher's Companion</h2>  <h2>Author  Robert J. Beynon</h2>
<h2>Pubished by Portland Press, London 1993 ISBN 1 85578 009 7</h2>
<h2>Paperback, 151 pages price £9.95</h2>


 As the title suggests, the book is aimed primarily at those about to embark
on  postgraduate study in the biological sciences, and focuses on the types
of planning needed for success. In particular, the author discusses many of
the important aspects of research (other than laboratory benchwork) which
are often given too little thought. It is suggested that the book may also
be of interest to supervisors, but it probably has less value to anyone with
a reasonable level of experience. <p>
 
 The chapters follow on logically, initially discussing the decisions to be
made prior to undertaking a research project, with subsequent advice on the
planning and time management of the project itself, and some of the later
chapters giving advice on the oral and written presentaion of scientific
work.  In addition to the more general points of interest, there is some
discussion on topics of a more practical nature, which are therefore of use
to refer to at a later date. <p>
 
 The author clearly states that many of the points made will seem obvious to
the majority, but unfortunately this may make some of the discussion appear
slightly laboured, however, the reader may be inspired to give more thought
to some issues before making some very important decisions or
commitments.<p>  

 The book is well laid out and easy to follow, with quick reference to
different sections. If you are new to research, then will certainly find it
a source of much sound advice on how to go about organising yourself.
Nevertheless, with the financial limitations of a student grant, the retail
price of #9.95 could perhaps be deemed excessive, as you may find that much
of the information can also be obtained from other sources, such as your own
department, fellow research workers and supervisors. <p>

<h2><a name="math">Mathematical</a> Techniques in Crystallography and Materials Science</h2>
<h2>Second Edition</h2>
<h2>Edward Prince</h2>
<h2>Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1994.</h2>


 Though this book has been available for 18 months, I was asked to re-review
it because it seemed that few of the participants as the BCA Intensive
course or the CCP4 School knew of its existence. <p>

 The First Edition was reviewed in detail in Acta Cryst ( 1984), A40, 86-87.
The reviewer noted a few misprints and inconsistencies, but overall thought
the book was good value.The Second Edition was reviewed in Acta Cryst
(1995), A51, 590. This reviewer concentrated largely on the new chapter on
Fast Fourier Transforms, but also commented on the readability of the
book.<p> 

 For readers not comfortable with mathematics, the first impression on
opening the book may be daunting. However, it is worth persevering, (perhaps
putting off following the mathematics for some future reading) just in order
to get the insights described in the text. For example, there is a
demonstration of the substantial equivalence of F and F~ refinement, and an
exposure of the hazard of asking whether a group of atoms is significantly
coplanar when the only information to hand is the result of an un-
constrained refinement (A better question is to ask whether a planar model
is compatible with the X-ray data - a reader determined to follow the first
alternative should also look at the articles by Sands and Marsh & Schomaker
in International Tables, Volume B). A substantial part of the book is
devoted to the problems of data fitting, modelling and the significance and
interpretation of results. Throughout, the reader is made aware of the
dangers of applying mathematics unthinkingly. Since many of the processes
described in the book lie at the heart of modern computer programs, it
should greatly help users get the best from the programs.<p> 

 For anyone developing crystallographic software, this book is a mine of
valuable information. Much of it does exist elsewhere in the literature, but
it could be very time consuming to locate it - assuming its existence was
known of.<p> 

This is a first rate little book, and every active crystallographer should
have access to it.<p>

<h1><a name="tape">X-ray</a> Crystallography, Part II</h1>
<h2> - Cassette Tape and Booklet.</h2>
<br>
By:  Steven Wallwork, (Nottingham University),
 Educational Techniques Group Trust, Education Division, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
 Distributed by Turpin Distribution Services Ltd., Blackhorse Road, Letchworth, Herts SG1 1HN, England. 1995 
ISBN 0 85186 420 1, £13 + VAT.<p>

The tape and booklet forms Part II of a two part course on X-ray
Crystallography, as an introduction to the use of X-rays in Chemistry, at an
undergraduate level. Part I, 1989, introduced X-ray powder and
single-crystal techniques, the Bragg equation, the amplitude and phase angle
of waves, systematic absences, crystal systems, Miller Indices and the P21/c
space group.  Part II develops further the calculation of the phase angle,
a, the structure amplitude, |F|, and how these contribute to the solution of
X-ray structures by Trial and Error Methods, the Patterson Method and by
Direct Methods.  Part II consists of a cassette tape, a 56 page booklet, 30
frames of text and Figures, and 10 problems, with detailed worked answers
provided.  The tape provides nearly two hours of listening time and the
numerical problems take three hours to work through, if the optional problem
on triple phase selection is omitted.<p>

        The cassette and tape would form an excellent basis for a tutorial
course to accompany a final year lecture program on X-ray Crystal Structure
Determination, especially for good students with a mathematical background,
who enjoy problem solving, as the first five problems represent one of the
best applications of Fourier series to X-ray crystallography available.  The
summation of Fourier series, the explanation of the origin of the phase
angle, Problem 3, the calculation of the multi-component structure
amplitudes, |F|, Problem 4, and the construction of the corresponding Argand
diagram, Problem 5, are all extremely informative. The sections on the Trial
and Error Methods, the Patterson Method and the Direct Methods, strongly
reflect the authors background in Physics, but are clearly described and
serve to illustrate the historical development of X-ray structure solution. <p>

At a time when the "Black Box" approach to structure solution predominates
in the undergraduate teaching program, it is nice to see an attempt made to
get back to the basic physics of crystallography, presented at the
undergraduate level, especially the account of the application of the Direct
Methods.  If there is a criticism of the text the choice of an I and Br atom
containing structure, Problem 7, to introduce the Heavy Atom Method, does
seem a little abstruse.  At an undergraduate level, a single heavy atom
structure in the P21/c space group, would be advantageous, as it would have
required an explanation of how the four equivalent positions of the heavy
atoms are connected to solve the Patterson Fourier.  It was also surprising
that the concept of reciprocal lattice space was not introduced, if only to
illustrate how systematic absences can be used to distinguish P, I, and F
type unit cells and the presence of screw axes and glide planes in a space
group.  If the aim of the cassette is to help readers of crystal structure
papers, the final section on refinement justifies expansion.  Such readers
may find the level of mathematics required rather daunting and might justify 
transfer of some of the more demanding mathematical sections to an appendix.

        Notwithstanding, X-ray Crystallography, Part II is strongly
recommended as an excellent supplementary teaching material, to a final year
course on X-ray Structure Determination.<p>
