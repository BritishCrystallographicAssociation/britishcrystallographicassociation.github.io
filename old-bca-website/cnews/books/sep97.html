When Liverpool mathematician Peter Cromwell became interested in polyhedra
he found that although many people have studied polyhedra for thousands of
years there was no readable modern book on them, only practical hints for
model makers or treatises handling multidimensional polytopes. He has
attempted to fill that gap. This is not a textbook; as the author says, a
study of polyhedra is no longer mainstream mathematical research. There are
ten chapters which are essentially independent essays on related aspects of
polyhedra, arranged roughly in historical order.  Most people will have
heard of 'Platonic' and 'Archimedean solids', but until I read this book I
did not know that Liu Hui in  China in 263 AD had described a dissection of
the cube which is now often found in interactive science museums.<p>
 
Following a useful introduction to define terms used, there are examples of
polyhedra in art and architecture (Plate 7 shows a photograph of a small
stellated dodecahedron in the marble mosaic floor of St. Mark's Basilica,
Venice). Other chapters are on  'Rules and Regularity', 'Surfaces, Solids
and Spheres'.   'Symmetry, Shape and Structure' is probably the chapter most
useful to a crystallographer, it  includes a 'decision tree' which could be
useful to students struggling to determine the symmetry type of a given
crystal or polyhedron.  Unfortunately, as he explains in the preface, some
topics are omitted, including duality and a study of space filling
polyhedra.<p>

This is a handsome book printed on good quality paper; each chapter begins
with an elegant full page illustration. There are many line diagrams in the
text, such as this one to the left. The colour plates are between pages 210
and 211, but it took me some time to find them because they are not listed
in the contents. There are 23 pages of bibliography, a 5 page name index and
a 9 page subject index. The bibliography is divided into sections, with
references grouped by chapter, but there are no reference numbers within the
chapter itself showing you exactly where a particular reference is
relevant.<p>

I expected a book of this kind to be accompanied by software, or a least a
list of World Wide Web sites for those interested in polyhedra. The diagrams
must have been generated by computer since the book was prepared by the
author using LaTeX and printed from the camera ready copy he supplied, but I
found no details of how the diagrams were made. The use of computers is
discussed in the chapter 'Counting, Colouring and Computing' where they are
used as tools to solve the problem of how to colour a polyhedron with a
minimum number of colours.<p>  

  You could buy this book for its wealth of
general information on polyhedra. I found it very readable, but as there is
little discussion of crystallographic applications, I think it too expensive
to recommend to students.  A cheaper paperback edition might be very good
value, especially if accompanied by an optional  CD-ROM  with images from
the book and software to allow readers to make their own polyhedral
diagrams. <p><br>

I have since discovered that the author has his own Web Site where you can 
learn more about this book at:
<a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/book/index.html">
http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/book/index.html</a><br>
where the Contents is listed, with some reviews, details, and a page of errata
which  includes several replacement pages (one of which is page 313 the
decision tree to help you decide on the symmetry of a polyhedron).<p>

He also has an amusing 
<a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/calendar/index.html">dodecahedral
calendar</a> as a postscript file which you cut out and construct as a
decoration for your desk, and a list of
 <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~spmr02/maths/sites.html">links to other
 polyhedral sites</a>.
