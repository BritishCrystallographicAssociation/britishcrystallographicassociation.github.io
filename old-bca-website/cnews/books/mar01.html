Book Review (1) Geometric symmetry in patterns and tiling<BR>
</strong>
<HR>
<P>
<em>Title</em> <strong> 'Geometric symmetry in patterns and tilings'</strong><BR>
<em>Author  </em>Clare E.Horne<BR>
<em>Publisher </em>Woodhead Publishing  23 October 2000  &pound;95   US $157   &#128;157<BR>
<em>ISBN </em>1 75573 492 3   256 pages  hardback   size 215 x 303mm 
<P>
Introductory text books of crystallography often contain a short chapter on
the 17 plane groups but they rarely have space to go into detailed
explanations and give illustrations of patterns of each type, before going
on to the more complex three-dimensional space groups. This can leave some
students unable to understand the subtleties of the more complex groups. 
This book could be an excellent reference work for a library where students
of crystallography  (or those studying it as part of courses in chemistry,
materials science, earth sciences etc. )  can study the two dimensional
patterns in greater detail to become familiar with the symmetry and other
operations involved in their production.
  
<P>
There are 6 chapters:
<ul>
  <li> Introduction
  <li> Classification of design by symmetry group
  <li> Classification of design by symmetry group and design unit
  <li> Classification of discrete patterns
  <li> Classification of isohedral tilings
  <li> Summary and conclusions
</ul>
 Each chapter has its own summary and list of
references. The book has over 1000 illustrations of two dimensional patterns
and includes simple instructions on how to create them.  Most of the
diagrams are original; they were made using the Harvard Graphics package,
which the author found rather inflexible.  On page 37 there is a useful flow
diagram for symmetry group identification of ditranslational designs. It
would be interesting to try this on the 
<a href="../2000/dec00/p1951.gif">design based on a crystal structure</a>
as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain reprinted on page 22 of the last
issue of <em>'Crystallography News'.</em>

<P>
The author is a mathematician who gained her PhD from the University of
Leeds in the combined disciplines of mathematics and design. She thinks that
good textile designers intuitively understand that their patterns are more
satisfying if they obey the geometric symmetry and translation rules
summarised in the 17 plane groups so she has written this book in an attempt
to help <em>all designers</em> to improve their work by a better
understanding of the geometry.  She assumes that designers have no formal
mathematical training and tries to explain from first principles how each
plane group is formed by translation, rotation and reflection.  The usual
crystallographic notation is used for the groups and methods are given for
the construction of designs based on each group. <BR>

 The left  part shows the mirror planes and the usual triangular symbol for
points of rotational symmetry 3; the larger black triangle shows the size of
the 'design unit', The right part of the diagram shows the result of
replicating this unit over the whole area, with the mirror lines still drawn
in it.  The grey shaded area shows the size of the pattern repeat. </p>

<P>
The content of this book makes it an excellent teaching aid, particularly
for those students with little mathematical training. Unfortunately, there
are problems of poor layout on the page and in the reproduction of the
figures which I did not expect in such an expensive book.

Mini-review - <em>'Nanotechnology'</em><BR>
a 'Technical Brief' from the <em>Institute of Physics</em><BR>
</strong>
<HR>
<P>
The Institute of Physics has produced a 20 page booklet on
<strong><em>"Nanotechnology Mechanical and Electronic Systems on a Molecular
Scale" </em></strong> ISBN  07503 0749 8. 

<P>
<BR>
It is the first in a new series of Briefs designed to provide technical
updates on current applications of physics  targeted at the non-specialist.
This one is a useful description of the 'state-of-the art' in
nanotechnology; a term which means different things to different people;
this brief focusses on the manufacture of nanoscopic electronic and
mechanical systems by molecular assembly. There is no attempt to cover
making designer proteins or the wide use of nanotechnology in materials
development, although the authors realise that perhaps some of the most
promising lines of development come in areas which span these boundaries.

  <li>scanning probe microscopes
  <li>nanotechnology construction processes
  <li>microelectromechanical systems
  <li>bucky tubes
  <li>molecular nanomechanics
  <li>a molecular motor
