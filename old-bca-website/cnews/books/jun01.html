The authors begin their preface with these sentences: <em>"The existence of
diffuse scattering in diffraction data has confounded and fascinated
crystallographers for over eighty years. For some it is an inconvenience,
increasing 'background' and obscuring weak Bragg peaks whereas others may
harness it to reveal the subtle details of structures".  </em>

In the rest of the book they explain in detail the theory and experimental
techniques to do this and give examples of applications in many materials.
The book is aimed at research workers in crystallography and can probably be
understood by graduate students with some mathematical training since the
authors explain their terminology clearly in the Introduction and include a
brief historical overview of the subject. Did you know that in the middle of
the Second World War, in early 1941, many eminent crystallographers,
including Kathleen Lonsdale, both Braggs and Max Born, attended a workshop
on diffuse scattering held at the Royal Society in London?   The front cover
of the September 1990 issue of 'Crystallography News'  carried  an example
of a surface plot representing the coherent diffuse elastic scattering from
a single crystal of cubic zirconia.  This was about the time that
R.L.McGreevy and W.Hayes at Oxford University were doing pioneering work on
computer modelling as an aid to data analysis with their D.Phil students,
who are the authors of this book, which was started some 5 years ago.
Although this is a book mainly concerned with neutron scattering there is a
short section on the uses of X-rays and electrons in diffuse scattering. 
Topics such as magnetism and quasielastic neutron scattering are not covered
since they are the subject of other recent books in this series.  </p>

Later chapters cover neutron scattering formalism, diffuse scattering theory
and  experimental techniques.  Instruments are not usually designed with
diffuse scattering experiments in mind, however, the authors suggest some
possible compromises in design which would make diffuse scattering
experiments easier.  Existing instruments are described which are at the
ISIS pulsed neutron source in the UK and at the Institute Laue Langevin
reactor source in Grenoble and there is a paragraph on the types of sample
environment needed.  Further chapters cover data correction and computer
simulation and modelling of the defect structures in the crystals. This has
much in common with the simulation of liquids; the techniques covered are
molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC)
simulations and the pair distribution function (PDF) analysis methods.

Later chapters cover applications of diffuse scattering theory to binary
systems, examples of diffuse scattering experiments on alloys, other binary
materials and on superionic conductors. Diffuse scattering can also be used
to study the internal structure of molecules such as that of ice at very low
temperatures; experiments are described which used the SXD instrument at
ISIS over a range of temperatures from 10 to 250 &deg;K. Large crystals were
needed (of the order 10mm diameter by 10mm height) in order to measure the
weak diffuse scattering with sufficient statistics in a limited time.
Organic molecules and even proteins can also be studied. The final chapter
concerns framework structures using the tetrahedral phases of silica as an
example.

This book is the first comprehensive account of diffuse neutron scattering 
and should be available to anyone working on neutron scattering.
