<strong><BR>Book Review - Crystal Structure Determination  by William Clegg<BR></strong>
<HR>

<P>
<strong>Crystal Structure Determination</strong><BR>
<em>Author:</em> William Clegg, University of Newcastle upon Tyne and Daresbury Laboratory<BR>
<em>Publisher:</em> Oxford University Press. May 1998  (Oxford Chemistry Primer No 60)<BR> 
 ISBN 0 19 855 901 1 &pound;5.99 paperback 85 pages <BR>
<em>The low cost of books in this series is made possible by the generous 
support of Zeneca Ltd.<BR></em>
<P>
     This is an excellent and highly successful attempt to get a quart into
a pint pot. Taken alone, the title 'Crystal Structure Determination' is over
ambitious, but in the context of the Oxford Chemistry Primer series it
neatly fills a niche, providing a very readable overview of the process. The
title also makes it clear that the book is not an introduction to general
crystallography.  <P>
     These Primers are aimed at chemistry undergraduates, and Prof Clegg has
tailored the content at exactly the correct level. The text does not attempt
to explain how to 'do' crystal structure analysis, but it carefully explains
how it is done, and how the findings can be applied in the general field of
chemistry. In fact, at 85 pages length, it would make excellent reading for
almost any established chemist starting a 3 hour plane or train journey. <P>
     The introductory chapter sets the scene through a brief and not too
mathematical description of the physics of diffraction. The discussion of
symmetry is gently blended into the text so as to avoid the intellectual
shock of more formal presentations, and includes coverage of the
relationship with the Schoenflies notation.  <P>
     Chapter 2 covers the process of single crystal structure determination,
starting with a flow diagram. Each step is accompanied with an estimate of
the time taken to complete the step - a table which chemists who last looked
at crystallography more than 5 years ago might do well to contemplate. The
section on experimental techniques is, as one might expect from Prof Clegg,
quite up-to-date, and he has taken great care to ensure that the text can be
read and understood without reference to any particular hardware or
software. This is the only chapter which contains material which might be
changed in a future edition. To my mind, the section 'A one-dimensional
illustration of direct methods and Patterson synthesis' is not required at
this level and could be omitted. Since multi-solution use of the tangent
formula is at the heart of most modern direct methods programs, a brief
description of this might be more use than the example of phase addition.
<P>
     Chapter 3 dissects 6 structure analyses, explains the problems, and
illustrates what can be gleaned from the analyses. I would have chosen a
purely organic material as one of the examples, even if only to make organic
chemists feel at home. <P>
     The final chapter introduces further problems, further techniques, and
draws out the relationship between single crystal and powder methods,
explaining why analysis from powders is usually more uncertain. The
suggested 'Further Reading' is well chosen, but the 'Index' could perhaps
have been more exhaustive. <P>
     This book is excellent value, and should be read by every chemistry
undergraduate. For those going on to research in crystallography, it serves
as a good introduction to the more meaty texts. Highly recommended.

<strong><BR>Book Review - 2  <em>Dorothy Hodgkin</em> by Georgina Ferry<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
<strong>Dorothy Hodgkin: A Life<BR></strong>
<em>Author:</em> Georgina Ferry<BR>
<em>Publisher:</em> Granta Books, London  November 1998  <BR>
ISBN 1 86207 167 5  &pound;20 hardback 423 pages  31 photographs
<P>
Dorothy Hodgkin was a great scientist, a campaigner for peace and the first
British woman to win a Nobel prize. I list her achievements in that order
because I believe that those were her priorities, although others may
disagree. 'Our Dorothy' was very special to members of the British
Crystallographic Association.  During her lifetime she preferred working on
solving crystal structures to writing books and although urged to write an
autobiography by her family, friends and colleagues, she only managed the
short one published in Volume 3 of her <a href="sep96.html#coll">
'Collected Works'</a> (see Issue 58 of
'Crystallography News' Sept 96 p22).  <BR>

<P>
The author of this first full length biography of Dorothy Hodgkin, Georgina
Ferry, wrote an article about Dorothy, published in 1994 in <em>Oxford
Today</em>  the alumni magazine of the University of Oxford.  She has since
published similar articles in the local newspapers to try to gain greater
recognition of Dorothy's achievements in the city where she did most of her
academic work.  Dorothy's family were so impressed by these articles that
they invited Georgina to write this biography and gave her help and access
to the extensive private papers.  Dorothy was one of those people who refuse
to throw things away, difficult for her family and colleagues, but a boon to
biographers.  Georgina Ferry never met Dorothy, but she has tried to
understand her by spending the last four years talking to her family,
friends and colleagues all over the world and consulting the Dorothy Hodgkin
Archive in the Bodleian Library, where both her scientific and  personal
papers are now stored.   The result is this massive biography, over 400
pages, weighing almost a kilogram. The author has diligently sifted through
the uncataloged personal papers to bring us a wealth of detail about the
remarkable story of Dorothy's Life.  This is very much a personal, not a
scientific story; the author writes in the preface, "I am not a chemist by
training, and certainly not a crystallographer".   

<P> The book has ten chapters, arranged chronologically, one for each stage
of Dorothy's life. The copious notes referring back to the original papers
are collected together into 12 pages of small print at the end, just before
the index. The first chapter gives us her family background, including that
of her parents and siblings. Dorothy was born in Cairo, the first of four
daughters, and had an unconventional education and upbringing for those
times.  The first of the family photographs shows Dorothy at the age of
about one year, gazing up adoringly at her mother, one of the great
influences on Dorothy.  In the first chapter we learn of Dorothy at age ten
being introduced to chemistry by growing alum crystals and being enchanted
by them. She became an undergraduate at Somerville College, Oxford; 
surviving letters from her friend at this time, Betty Murray, show Dorothy
so engrossed in her crystal structures that it was difficult to persuade her
to
look after herself by eating regular meals.   She moved to Cambridge to work
on a Ph.D and was probably fortunate to have had J.D.Bernal as her Ph.D
supervisor. Unlike many scientists then and now he generously put his
graduate students names on their joint research papers so that her name
became known as one of the authors of significant early papers on protein
structure.  His political views must have reinforced Dorothy's Socialist
political tendencies initially fostered by her mother. <P>

In later chapters we read of Dorothy returning to Oxford, of her problems in
setting up her own group in a new field, of combining crystallography with
marriage and motherhood and we learn what it was like to be a scientist in
Oxford during the period 1930 to 1960 when protein crystallography was in
its infancy.  The final chapters concern her Nobel prize, her peacemaking
with the Pugwash convention of concerned scientists and the help she gave to
others especially those in India and China.  

<P>
The main criticism I have is that the book is over long, perhaps because
there are no diagrams. We are told many times that Dorothy liked drawing,
had a visual mind, and an incredible ability to look at a Patterson function
and deduce the crystal structure. If you have no idea what a Patterson
function looks like you cannot appreciate how remarkable this ability is, so
I think this book should have included at least one example of a Patterson
map together with diagrams or photographs of molecular models. Since the
author is not a chemist I think she should have omitted the explanations of
the science which I think too brief to be effective for non-scientists and
unnecessary for crystallographers.

<P>
Strangely, although Dorothy had 3 children, none have become
crystallographers, so she did not transmit her enthusiasms to her family who
were the instigators of this book. Perhaps that is why it is hard to find
the excitement of the science among the wealth of personal detail.  If you
want a concise summary of the many awards Dorothy received you will have to
look elsewhere; there are several on the Internet for example.

<P>
Hardback books are expensive these days; at &pound;20 this book is
reasonable value for money if you are a scientist who already understands
the science and want to read the many fascinating details of the life of
Dorothy Hodgkin.

Book review - 3   The Mathematics of Structures</h2>

Mathematicians have studied minimal surface for over a hundred years.
Recently some scientists have begun to think that we would get a greater
understanding of interactions between materials if the forces between atoms
were modelled by looking at the <strong><em>surfaces</em></strong>  between
them and represented their structures by isosurfaces of their electron
density. Alan Mackay provided a striking image for the front cover of
'Crystallography News' in September 1991. R.Nesper (ETH, Zurich) gave an
interesting talk about this at the IUCr Congress in Beijing in 1993;
recently Michael Jacob spoke on August 18th at ECM-18 in Prague in the
session on <strong>Symmetry. </strong> He is a co-author of this book which
attempts to explain a new formalism which he calls '<em>exponential scale
mathematics'</em>, in which several equations are combined on the
exponential scale to yield a new '<em>hybridised'</em> function.  For
example, the usual definition of a cube needs 6 equations one for each face. 
Here the definition of a cube is:           10 <SUP>z</SUP> + 10<SUP> y
</SUP>+ 10<SUP> z </SUP>+ 10<SUP> -x </SUP>+ 10 <SUP>-y</SUP> +10<SUP>
-z</SUP> = Constant

<P>
The base is 10 in this case but it may be any positive number (greater than
1 );  '<em>e'</em> is usually chosen to link this formalism to the more
traditional ones. <BR>      
      <img src="dec98.gif" alt="fig from book"><br>
<P>
This is a mathematics picture book written by a chemist who finds this
method of describing surfaces easier to use when describing structures. The
ten chapters give examples of structures showing how this formalism can be
used for 2 dimensional plots,  closed polyhedra, (the cube on the left of
the diagram above) and surfaces such as that on the right, taken from Page
106, (6 catenoids surrounding an interstitial oxygen in <em>hcp</em>). There
is no explanation of how the diagrams were made; the Appendix has code in
'Mathematica Notebook' format, so I assume it was the expensive package
'Mathematica'. Does anyone know of a cheaper package to make similar plots?. 
To understand the relevance of the plots to crystallography one would have
to refer to the 23 papers listed at the end under  'References'.
