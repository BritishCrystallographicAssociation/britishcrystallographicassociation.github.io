<h2><a name="isis">The</a> ISIS Facility</h2>

<P>
If one uses the broadest definition of<em> in situ</em> diffraction, the
ISIS Facility has been hosting or pioneering work in this field for some
time, developing equipment for high pressure or high temperature diffraction
from the first years of operation.

<P>
Current ISIS sample environment equipment for temperature dependent work<br>
<ul>
  <li>covers the range 1.5K to 300K and then up to 1100 centigrade with 
<strong>vanadium element furnaces</strong> (1200 centigrade with care)
  <li>up to 2000 centigrade with a <strong>tantalum element furnace </strong>
 (provided your sample has a suitable container). The
tantalum furnace also comes with collimation so that data collected at
2theta=90 degrees will be free of contaminating Bragg reflections from the
tantalum element and heat shields. 
 <li> High
pressure and temperature may be applied simultaneously using a new cell that
provides up to 10kbar and 1100K {S.Hull <em>et al,</em> Nucl. Inst.
&amp; Methods 385 (1997) 354}. There are plans to extend this to allow 
simultaneous diffraction and measurements of electrical conductivity
to elucidate the role of thermally induced disorder in superionic
materials with a combination of X-ray and neutron diffraction and electrical
impedance spectroscopy

<h1>Reactive chemical environments</h1><br>
Two teams are developing reactive chenical environments.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ncl.ox.ac.uk/icl/dermot/">Dermot O'Hare's group</a>
      at the University of Oxford 
     is working on a cell for hydrothermal synthesis
  <li>A collaboration between ISIS and the <a href="http://www.ri.ac.uk/DFRL/">
RI 
   (Royal Institution of Great Britain)</a> has built apparatus to study catalytic
   processes in microporous solids. This allows controlled amounts of various 
    reactive gases to be introduced to the sample over a wide range of 
    temperature. For details ontact Ian Bailey of the ISIS Sample Environment 
       section (email:<a href="mailto:"ifb@isise.rl.ac.uk"">ifb@isise.rl.ac.uk 
</a>) or 
    John Turner at the RI (email: 
<a href="mailto:"jturner@ri.ac.uk"">jturner@ri.ac.uk</a> ). 
  <li>A recent grant from EPSRC has funded the development of an <em>in situ
     </em> reaction cell for general users. Dr. Ron Smith of the ISIS Facility,
   is coordinating this project and would be grateful for input from potential
   users to determine the design of the reactive cell, materials for sample 
   cells, gas-handling facilities, limits in temperature and pressure. 
   Contact Ron by email:<a href="mailto:"ris01@isise.rl.ac.uk"">ris01@isise.rl.ac.uk</a>

<h1>New instrumentation</h1>
<P> Development of instrumentation is not just concerned with the sample
environment - it also involves improvements to the diffractometers or
construction of new instruments. At ISIS, the grant to provide a new
reaction cell is accompanied by funds for a T-zero chopper on the POLARIS
diffractometer which will greatly lower the background signal from large
pieces of sample environment equipment. 
<p>
Around the year 2000, the new
<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/crystallography/gem/gem.htm">
General Materials Diffractometer,</a> GEM,
 should be running with a combination of high resolution over a wide range
of scattering vector and a high count rate that will allow rapid collection
of high quality diffraction data.
