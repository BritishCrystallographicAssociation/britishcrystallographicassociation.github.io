<h1>Explanation of in situ diffraction</h1>
<P>
Diffraction experiments are generally performed using
samples prepared well in advance and brought to the diffractometer for 
measurement. However,
there are many circumstances where this cannot be done, for example,
where the sample is only formed for a short time in a reactive
environment an interactive method is required where the
formation or transformation of the sample takes place on the diffractometer 
itself. This method is known as <em> in situ</em> diffraction; its use
has grown enormously recently with the development of more intense
sources of X-rays and neutrons which enable experiments on smaller samples,
faster transformations, or in environments with more restricted access to
the probe.
