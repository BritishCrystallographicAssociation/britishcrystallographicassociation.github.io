<h2>DESIGN A LOGO FOR THE 18TH I.U.Cr. CONGRESS IN GLASGOW</h2>

As you will know, the 18th I.U.Cr. Congress is due to be held in
Glasgow in August 1999. The meeting will need a suitable logo
ready for the 1996 I.U.Cr Meeting in Seattle next year. The B.C.A.
has decided, therefore, to launch a competition to design one.
It is open to any BCA member, and the prize will be free registration
for the 1999 meeting, as well as the pleasure of seeing your artwork
on display throughout the crystallographic world!<p>
 <br>
Please bear the following points in mind:<br>
 <br>
<ol>
  <li>Colour is fine, and INDEED preferred, but the logo must also reproduce 
    well in greyscale.
  <li>The meeting is British, but will have a very <em>Scottish</em> flavour.
  <li> It is a <em>crystallography</em> meeting.
  <li> <strong>Absolutely no haggis!</strong>
</ol>
Please send your entries to:<br>
