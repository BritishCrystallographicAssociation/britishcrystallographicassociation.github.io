<h1>MEMBERS ACTIVITIES in `SET95'</h1>
In 1994 the Minister for Science, William Waldegrave, gave funding for aweek
of scientific activities for the general public, known as 'Set7'. This was
highly successful, and prompted the BCA to offer a 'Design an Exhibit' prize 
to encourage young visitors in 'hands on' science centres to learn more
about some aspect of crystallography. In 1995 funding was again allocated
for a national science week, 'Set95', organised by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science; this was even more successful so there is to
be another in March next year, 'Set 96'. (Details are in the list of
Forthcoming meetings at the back of this issue.)<p>

The winner of the 'Design an Exhibit' competition was Moreton Moore, who
suggested some 'building blocks' in novel shapes, such as the
rhombicdodecahedron and the cuboctahedron, shown in the diagram (coming
soon). During the past year we have commissioned two suppliers to make
prototype examples of the exhibit which we plan to loan to science centres
or take to primary schools. In addition to a number of 'blocks' each shape
has two bases consisting of half blocks in different orientations on which
to build a tower. One is made in bright yellow plastic from 'Polydron'
pieces, the other hand crafted in plywood. The idea is that children move
blocks from one tower to make the other, and discover that cubes or
rectangular bricks are not the only polyhedra which will completely fill
space. <p>

Professor R.Catlow of the Royal Institution, gave an entertaining lecture at
the Rutherford Appleton laboratory on the topic of 'Chemistry, Crystals and
how things change'. His audience of Oxfordshire school children, tried out
our 'blocks' before and after the lecture, and appeared to greatly enjoy
them.  We also brought the blocks to the Cardiff meeting for members to try
out for themselves. <strong>We are now looking for a children's toy
manufacturer who already sells plastic blocks, and who might be interested
in producing these blocks in quantity. </strong>We also wondered whether
they might make an educational'executive toy' so we are looking for a
manufacturer of smaller, possibly metal blocks. <em>Please suggest possible
names to the editor. </em><p>

While building towers of blocks at Cardiff I talked to other members who had
been active in Set 95. Dr P.K.Bryant and colleagues from the Wellcombe
Foundation had been asked by a local primary school to explain diffraction
of Xrays by crystals, so they made some mats with molecular 'ball and stick'
diagrams drawn on them, stood a child on each atom, with a coloured cap made
of 'velcro' like material to represent the atom type. The X-rays were
represented by foam balls thrown by the other children, the idea being to
see how many foam 'Xrays' would collide with the 'atoms' and bounce off.<p>

Dr. D. Dyson, of the Industrial group had been making up scientific quizzes
and taking them to schools; we hope to get some examples for you to try, and
perhaps take to your local schools in 'Set96'.<p>
