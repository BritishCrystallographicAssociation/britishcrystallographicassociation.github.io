<h1><a name="dl">X-ray </a>diffraction at Daresbury Laboratory</h1>
<h2>R J Cernik</h2>
On the 1st of April 1995 Daresbury Laboratory became part of the Council for
the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils together with the Rutherford
Appleton and Chilbolton Laboratories. The latter institution is an
observatory situated in leafy Hampshire. The new Council (denoted hereafter
as CCL) has the major responsibility of delivering world class facilities
for its users. The users in this context could come from one of the research
councils, the European Union, industry or some other collaborative
agreement.<p>

Within CCL various new departments exist, one of which is the Synchrotron
Radiation Department headed by Ian Munro. Within this new department there
are seven operations groups of which X-ray diffraction is one. The
operations groups are responsible for running and operating the experimental
stations. The X-ray diffraction group is headed by Bob Cernik and is
responsible for the provision of facilities for powder diffraction,
reflectivity and standing wave studies, high flux small molecule
crystallography, kinetic and dynamic studies, topography, high pressure
studies, liquids and amorphous scattering, diffraction physics and magnetic
X-ray scattering. Other groups in the Synchrotron Radiation Department
include, for example, protein crystallography, X-ray spectroscopy, surface
science, non crystalline diffraction and the VUV and IR groups. The major
emphasis of these groups is to maintain and develop experimental facilities
for our users. The heads of these new groups form the basis of the facility
operations committee that is responsible for the delivery of the beam time
and experimental facilities for the SRS. We shall continue to support the
experimental facilities with a vigorous in house and collaborative research
and development programme.<p>

The X-ray diffraction group is currently supporting four experimental
research stations (9.1,9.7,2.3 and 7.6), with three more currently under
construction (9.8,16.3 and 16.4). The community also has an interest in
X-ray diffraction on three other stations (9.4a, 9.3 and 8.4), the latter is
a test station managed by our group, 9.4 and 9.3 are the responsibility of
other groups.<p>

The direct interests of the users in the X-ray diffraction group are
represented by two Specialist User Groups or SUGs. These are ‘Crystal
Physics’ and ‘Powder diffraction and Crystallography’, chaired by Moreton
Moore (Royal Holloway) and Paul Barnes (Birkbeck) respectively. These groups
used to be linked very strongly to the experimental programme by the old BAP
system. The new system of applications via the Physics, Chemistry, Materials
and Biological SESSs has resulted in a less formal although still vital role
for the SUGs. The energy and enthusiasm put in by members of the SUGs has
ensured that the SESS system has worked well and good contacts with the user
groups has been maintained. <p>

<h3>The Current facilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
9.1 This is the original powder diffraction station at Daresbury and is
managed by Graham Bushnell-Wye. It  provides the capability for high
resolution powder diffraction, the study of liquid and amorphous materials
and the study of materials at high pressure using monochromatic radiation
and an image plate detector. High and low temperature facilities are
available and are in the process of being updated. The rotating capillary
cryostat is to be replaced with a two stage cooler which will in the first
instance be shared with station 2.3. This cryostat should be significantly
easier to use than the older continuous flow Oxford Instruments device. The
GTP furnace has also been upgraded and now operates with a magnetic drive
coupling making the operation smoother. In addition an induction furnace is
now nearing completion and will be able to heat samples to 1600o C and
higher. 
  <li>  
2.3   This station operates mostly for the collection of high resolution
powder diffraction data and is managed by Chiu Tang. A growing use of the
station has been glancing angle work, reflectivity and the analysis of thin
films using X-ray standing waves. There are a number of attachments for
texture measurements and a general purpose motorised goniometer for
specialised applications. The Oxford Instruments cryostat will be replaced
with a displex two stage system as explained above. The induction furnace
described above will also fit onto 2.3 giving very high temperature
capability to the station for the first time.
  <li>
9.7     ( 9.8     This station currently operates in two modes, firstly for
energy dispersive powder diffraction, and secondly for crystallography using
the Laue method. It will be substantially enhanced from September 1995 to
February 1996 and will provide much needed facilities for small molecule
crystallography in addition to existing experimental equipment. During this
period the station will not be available for use. A four circle
diffractometer will be installed which will be equipped with an area
detector and the standard counter for measurement of individual reflections. 
This is an EPSRC funded project led by Bill Clegg (Newcastle) and Richard
Catlow (Royal institution). When operational this will be the first    

dedicated facility for small molecule crystallography on the SRS.
  <li>
7.6             This is one of the oldest stations on the SRS but still
provides a great deal of very high quality output. It is currently the focus
of a bid to upgrade and enhance the station and is being led by Peter
Haycock (Keele). If successful the project would result in the installation
of a new 4-circle diffractometer and the refurbishment of the double crystal
camera.
 <li>
16.3    This is the end of line station on the new wiggler beamline. The
experimental facilities include a six circle diffractometer optimised for
high wavevector resolution. This station will be used, for example,  for 
the study of incommensurate structures, charge density waves, multiple
diffraction, standing waves and magnetic scattering. The station is just
ready to receive it’s first beam for commissioning. The station is managed
by Steve Collins, it will be ready for commissioning with users early in
1996. Anyone interested in collaborating with these commissioning trials
should either contact Steve or Bob. 
 <li>
16.4    Last in this list but significantly the greatest tonnage is 16.4.
This new white beam station will out  perform station 9.7 at energies above
40 keV, applications for higher energy kinetics or high pressure work will
be transferred onto this station from 9.7. High flux low energy kinetics
will stay on 9.7. In addition to the usual equipment associated with an
energy dispersive station 16.4 will have a unique high pressure and high
temperature facility for large volume samples. The 1000 ton press is shown
in the photograph being unloaded  from the delivery lorry. With suitable
high pressure cell inserts we shall have the capability of heating and
squeezing 1cm3 samples up to 250 kbar and 2000°C. This will enable the study
of many ceramic and mineral formation processes. Commissioning is proceeding
this year. Some aspects of the station will be available in 1996 for
scheduling. The station is managed by Simon Clark, further information is
available from him.
