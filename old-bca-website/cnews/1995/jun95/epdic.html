Fourth European Powder Diffraction Conference (EPDIC IV)</strong><br>
 <br>
to be held in Chester, England from Monday 10 to Friday 14 July 1995 
 <br>
The meeting is being organised by the Daresbury Laboratory
 <br>
The conference programme has a broad appeal covering all areas of powder
diffraction. However, there are three main themes, structure solution and
refinement, dynamic scattering or structures in change, and industrially
relevant and practical uses. There will be comprehensive poster sessions
fully integrated with the commercial exhibition. <p>

Anyone interested in software development is encouraged to attend the
Collaborative Computational Project on Powder Diffraction and Small Molecule
Crystallography  <strong>CCP14 Open Meeting </strong> to be held on Monday
July 10th. This is the first meeting since the project began. It aims to
develop an integrated suite of programs covering the whole range of
functions involved in the analysis of a sample. There will be a hands on
demonstration of the CCP14 suite. Comments and suggestions are welcome from
all areas of the world, there is no intention to limit this project to the
UK or Europe. Fee of £10 excluding accommodation. <p>

On Friday July 14th there is another one day meeting on the powder
diffraction file organised by the JCPDS/ICDD. Fee of £20 excluding
accommodation. <p>

<strong>Philips </strong> are inviting nominations for a Conference Award
honouring outstanding scientific achievement by young scientists in the
areas covered by the EPDIC IV programme. It has a value of 1,000 ECUs. The
winner will be invited to present a plenary talk at the next European Powder
Diffraction Conference. Proposals should be sent to the Conference Chairman
at the address below.<p>
