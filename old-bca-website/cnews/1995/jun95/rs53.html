<strong>Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships</strong><br>
 - A New Initiative for young scientists<p>

    The Royal Society is piloting a new postdoctoral fellowship scheme, to
be known as the Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowships. The idea for the scheme arose
from the Society's own investigation in 1994 into the current situation for
women scientists, and was consolidated by the findings of 'The Rising Tide'
a report produced for the Office of Science and Technology (OST). Both the
Society and the OST concluded that the first few years after a PhD, when
young persons aged between 25 and 35 are establishing themselves in
scientific careers, is also the time when a) the individual may be starting
a family b)the "system" offers very little in the way of security and
flexibility at work.<p>

      Clearly the conflict of pressure from home and work will impact on
both parents, but as women tend to take on the main responsibilities of
child-rearing they are normally the ones most severely affected. Statistics
show that the stage between PhD and Lecturer is one during which a
significant number of women find themselves either progressing rather more
slowly than their male colleagues, or deciding to abandon their research
careers altogether. The Society is therefore piloting this new scheme  to
offer a recognised first step into a research career for excellent young
scientists and engineers. The fellowships are open to both sexes and will
offer a high level of support and flexibility which is advantageous to both,
but should be particularly useful and encouraging to women. The Society
stresses that awards will be made on merit. <p>

     Ten fellowships will be available offering four years' guaranteed
tenure on research Staff IA/II scale, up to  £5000 annual grant to cover
research expenses, the option of participating in mentor and networking
schemes, the option of working part time, regular career advice,
support and flexibility with maternity cover.<p>

      Applicants should preferably not have passed their 35th birthday by  1
October 1995 and should have Ph.D or equivalent research experience. They
should have had no more than three years' research experience at
post-doctoral level on taking up the fellowship and should be normally
resident in the UK. <p>
 
    The Royal Society enrolled the help of universities, as prospective
employers of the Dorothy Hodgkin Fellows, by asking them to advertise the
scheme internally. Two different forms of advertisement were used, one for
those departments where women are significantly under-represented, the other
for all other departments.<p> 

     Although named after Dorothy Hodgkin, the fellowships are not limited
to crystallographic applicants, they cover all areas of natural sciences.
They will be funded by a mixture of the Society's own private funds and its
Parliamentary Grant-in-aid.<p> 
 
      The closing date for these fellowships was 19 May 1995, so by the time
you read this it will be too late to apply, but I thought members would like
to learn of this initiative. Those of you who have been regularly looking at 
BCA news on our World Wide Web homepage  will have seen
this news in time to apply.<p> 

     We hope to bring you a report on the winners of the first set of
fellowships in a future issue of 'Crystallography News'.<p> 



<h2><a name="new95">New Fellows</a> of the Royal Society</h2>

Amongst other new Fellows of the Royal Society elected at the meeting on
March 9, 1995 were:<p> 

 Professor <strong>Julia Stretton Higgins,</strong> Professor of Polymer Science at the 
Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of London.
Professor Higgins is distinguished for her studies of the molecular
structure of polymers, the basic molecules of plastics and gels.  She has
used a range of techniques to study their properties and dynamics,
especially neutron scattering techniques, which she has developed and
applied in novel and imaginative ways.  Her work on the thermodynamics and
demixing processes in blends of polymers has particular importance.<p>

Professor <strong>Frank Matthew Leslie,</strong>  Professor of mathematics at the University
of Strathclyde has used mathematical models to study the alignment and
motion of liquid crystals in magnetic fields.<p>

Dr.<strong> Colin George Windsor,</strong> Senior Scientist at the  National NDT Centre, AEA
Technology, Didcot, Oxfordshire. Dr. Windsor is distinguished for his
outstanding experimental and modelling skills, used to especial effect in
the industrial application of beams of neutrons.  He demonstrated the use of
pulsed beams of neutrons to study solid matter, and pioneered the
application of the penetrating abilities of neutrons to study critical
defects and internal stress in engineering products.  More recently he has
applied pattern recognition techniques and neural nets to a range of areas,
including weld defect classification, the analysis of the financial index,
and signature recognition.<p>

   <li>Change in Administrative Structure of the Royal Society<br>

Sir Austin Bide headed a review of the Society's administration which was
published in a Corporate Plan in December 1993. It recommended a new
structure which came into effect on January 1 1995. A central core
management provides Council support, administrative and programme
coordination and resource management. The various activity programmes are
administered through six sections each of which reports to an Officer and
works to develop and implement programmes for their area. A new Finance and
General Purposes Committee is responsible for resource allocation and
control. A Strategy/Policy Board assesses proposals on behalf of Council and
advises it on strategy. The old International Relations Department no longer
exists. The new Section for Science Advice assumed responsibility for the UK
commitment to the International Council of the Scientific Unions (ICSU); it
houses both National and International aspects of Science Advice. The new
head of Section is Dr.P.M.D.Collins.<br>
 Miss Ruth A.Cooper still has particular responsibility for ICSU, she can be
reached at The Royal Soci ety, 6 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG.

  <li> <strong>IUPAC Publications & meetings</strong><br>  
Blackwell Science has recently produced two publications for the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC),  <strong>'IUPAC
Handbook 1994-1995'</strong>
 describing the activities and rules of IUPAC, and <strong> 'History of
IUPAC 1919-1987' </strong> to mark the 75th anniversary of IUPAC in 1994.
Paperback versions are available at a reduced rate through the Secretariat
to members of IUPAC bodies and affiliates.  <p>

 Several IUPAC sponsored symposia are listed in the 'Forthcoming meetings'
section at the end of this issue. Further details from:
