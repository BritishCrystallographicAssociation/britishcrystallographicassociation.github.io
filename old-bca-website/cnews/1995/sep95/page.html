<h1>From the President.</h1>

It is with sadness that we learnt of the death of Arthur Wilson recently,
another of our great founding fathers lost from the subject, in person but
not in legacy and memory for those of us who knew him. You are all invited
to attend his Memorial Meeting to be held on Sunday 17th September 1995 in
Cambridge. (Details are printed later in this issue). 
<p>
I have just returned from the ACA meeting in Montreal which was another
large gathering of crystallographers from the World with a good
representation from the UK. We were more than 1100 in total, with many
parallel sessions, a full general program, posters and evening sessions. Our
congratulations to Jenny Glusker and Ken Trueblood who shared the Fankuchen
Award this year in Montreal and indeed effectively also shared the award
lecture, both entertaining a packed lecture theatre. It is hard to fit it
all in and I can see that juggling the program topics for 1996 this week in
Lund will present some problems for the Program Committee. However that is
looking good at this stage and it should be an excellent meeting. 
<p>
Lund too promises to be a splendid week and presents us with plenty of
choice in a full schedule. I am looking forward to meeting our Scandinavian
colleagues on home ground and in a part of Sweden I have not yet visited.
<p>
Are you working on a 1999 logo for Glasgow?  (Submission details are printed
later in this issue).  The news there is that the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre is to undergo a major expansion and refurbishment to be
ready in 1997/8, so we will gain enormously from this, and the building
program the city is undertaking on the opposite bank of the river, including
additional medium priced hotels. Chris Gilmore and I continue to work on the
details, but we do not really get into gear until after Seattle, all being
well!
<p>
It is the Conference Season now and many of you will be on the road again
this summer. The BCA Council has supported a much increased number of
Bursaries this year to assist members at meetings, which I strongly support.
I hope to meet some of you on your travels but wish you all splendid
crystallographic and other meetings and a safe return to the new academic
year. If anyone has an interesting meeting report please send it to Kate,
especially if you have written it already for another purpose. Please also
send her news of forthcoming meetings. 
<p>
May I remind members that I will end my term of office at the Cambridge BCA
Annual meeting next Spring, and you are all invited to nominate my
successor. Send your nominations either to myself or one of the other
Officers at any time. We shall be deciding on a Council nominee in late
October. 
<p>
Congratulations to John Squire on his professorial promotion and also to
Kenneth Harris newly appointed to the Structural Chemistry Chair at
Birmingham.
<p>
Until the first of our Autumn Group Meetings.

<h2>STOP PRESS!!</h2>
<h3>IUCr 17, Seattle USA 9 -17 August 1996 </h3>

From your President in Lund, 3 August 1995 <br>
It is not too soon to start preparing to be there,
and what to talk about! Full details of the program will be given in the
Autumn issue of the IUCr Newsletter and the December issue of
'Crystallography News'. The Program Commitee have done their work, the
keynote speakers and microsymposia topics identified. The Call for Papers
will be  mailed in the Autumn from the US with a <strong>deadline of February 1st
1996</strong>.  This meeting will  be the first IUCr to use the World Wide Web
extensively, and as for the recent ACA in Montreal,  abstracts will be
available on the Web after acceptance.

<h1>From the tresaurer</h1>
<h2>Financial Arrangements between BCA Council and Groups</h2>

BCA Council will be asked at its meeting in October to consider a proposal
that the present system of annual payments to each of the four interest
groups, based on the number of Ordinary members be discontinued. This is
because the practical difficulties in determining the most appropriate
values of these payments are now probably greater than their monetary value
to any of the groups. If the subventions to groups then cease, it is likely
that Council would allocate each year an equivalent sum of money to either
the Bursary Fund or for increased support of the Group Scientific Programmes
at the Spring Conference. 
<p>

Some facts related to the history of this matter are set out below. Members'
comments are welcomed and these should reach their Group Representative, or
any other member of Council, in good time before the Autumn meeting in
London on 30th October.  
<p>
 Each year BCA Council has traditionally given a per capita subvention to
those of its four constituent groups having Ordinary Members, whilst Joint
Members (whose subscription is paid indirectly via RSC and/or IoP were
excluded from consideration amongst those for whom this subvention was paid.
<p>

 Since the new BCA Membership database became available in 1994, it has become
very clear that:<br>
<ul> 
  <li>the group membership figures used previously were inaccurate and so
affected the two Joint Groups differently from the other two groups
  <li>the use of only, one group per member, i.e. a single main interest
group, does not adequately reflect the real level of support for each of the
four interest groups
  <li>the relative strengths of the four groups is different when judged by
counting either members' one main interest or all of their special interests
  <li>a few members express interest in all four groups (whilst more have
still not expressed special interest in any group), whilst most people
indicate only one group - but with a significant number marking two groups
as being of specia interest
  <li>the Bye-laws of the BCA provide for members to belong to more than one
group, on payment of a further subscription fixed by the Council
  <li>the level of such further subscription has, since the beginning of the
BCA, always been deemed by Council as being zero 
  <li>any possible introduction of real supplementary rates of subscription
would add to both the complexity of the BCA membership structure 
  <li>this structure already has so many different options that many members
wish to see simplification of the renewal form
  <li>the distinction between the two counting methods (special interest(s)
or main interest) has little significance for anything other than the
financial subvention
   <li>the separation of interest group affiliations from all monetary
factors might be a more useful step than adding to existing complexity
   <li>none of the groups are very dependent upon these subventions for their
financial security

<h1> APOLOGY</h1>

   In the June Issue of BCA News, there is, a report on the Aston Intensive
Course. In preparing the list of sponsors, I carelessly omitted
Enraf-Nonius. I wish to apologise for this omission. and state that
Enraf-Nonius have been strong supporters of the Course from its very
beginnings in 1987.<p>

<h2><a name="it">Whither</a> the International Tables?</h2> 
      As I was making up this issue I received the latest IUCr Newsletter
(Vol 3 No.2) which begins with a letter from the President, Philip Coppens,
entitled <strong>'What is the future of the International Tables?'</strong>
<p>
  I feel sure
Arthur Wilson would want us to continue his editorial work on this valuable
resource for all Crystallographers. A new volume covering the many aspects
of macromolecular Crystallography not covered in the current Tables is being
considered.  Here are my thoughts on this problem, please let the BCA
Council know yours.<p> 

<strong>Other means of disseminating the information must be
explored. </strong>
Printing books is difficult expensive and time consuming;
CD-ROMs can be quickly and easily copied and used on the ubiquitous personal
microcomputers; when can we have the <strong>Tables on CD-ROM?</strong><p>

The growth of the World Wide Web means that soon everyone will be able to
access vast amounts of information on-line.  Perhaps  database servers could
each hold a copy of the International Tables; I think it unlikely that the
IUCr server at Chester which maintains the 'World Directory of
Crystallographers' would be able to cope with the network traffic if there
were only one copy kept at Chester.  Perhaps the  introductory type pages
could still be published in book form, with the Table pages themselves kept
on-line. Then it would be easy for users to download the few pages relevant
to their current work and print them locally.
 <strong>Let us know your ideas.</strong>

URL http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/index.html<br>

Ads like these have been put on the BCA www pages since the Easter meeting
at Cardiff.  People can see your position vacant or equipment notices very
much more quickly than waiting for 'Crystallography News' to be printed
every 4 months.   I have been adding more information to the home page; you
can now search journal contents pages, or look at publishers latest books.
The CUP ad for Michael Woolfson's new book is the first to print a WWW
address in one of our ads.<p>

The Industrial Group Newsletter is now on-line, and so is most of the
previous issue of 'Crystallography News'. Members who are wondering what
became of their Protein Data Bank Newsletter should look in the PDB pages on
the WWW to find out. They are easily found via the BCA home page, URL given
above.<p>

Please let me know of any other links you would like to to set up from this

<h2><a name="stnu">SOFTWARE</a>  DEVELOPMENT  AT  NEUTRON  SCATTERING  SOURCES</h2>
 A second workshop on
software development at neutron scattering sources, <strong>(SoftNeSS'95)</strong> is to be
held on September 21-22 1995 in the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), in the U.S.A.  The aim is to produce a draft for an
<strong>international standard format</strong> for the exchange of neutron scattering data
among neutron scattering facilities and the user community.  It is designed
to promote co-operation in future software development and to support the
user community in developing their own applications for the analysis and
visualisation of neutron scattering data.  A draft proposal can be seen on
the World Wide Web at:<br>

<h2>The<a name="ctour"> Crystallographic </a>Tourist</h2>

Arnold Beevers visits to crystallographically interesting places have given
me an idea for this new section for 'Crystallography News'. He was just
leaving for Vienna to see the 'Max Perutz' library when he sent me the text
of his article.  Members are invited to send me short articles describing
other interesting places they have seen. They may be museums such as the
Crum Brown museum which we might all visit in 1999, architecturally
interesting shapes or patterns such as the Escher murals in Holland or a
tiling on the Alhambra, in Granada, Spain.  Moreton Moore suggested building
childrens' climbing frames from more interesting shapes than cubes (Sept 94
issue 50 page12). Some countries already have such things; Istvan and
Magdolna Hargittai have published photographs of climbing frames in their
new book 'Symmetry'. There is a truncated icosahedron (the bucky ball shape)
in Hokkaido University, Japan and in Tel Aviv, Israel, there is a truncated
octahedron climbing frame.  Can anyone send me a photograph of an unusual UK
climbing frame in a polyhedral shape? Or other crystal models, mineral
collections or interactive science centres which we might visit to escape
from our computers for a little while.
