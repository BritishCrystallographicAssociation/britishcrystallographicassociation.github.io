In the last issue I reported the Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils was established by Royal Charter on 1 April 1995, with the
abbreviation CCL  The previous name DRAL is no longer in use for DL +
RAL.The abbreviation 'CCL' has given rise to difficulties and ambiguities
where other organisation are already using CCL as their title;  the four
letters 'CLRC' may be used as an abbreviation for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils.  It operates from three sites, the Chilbolton
Observatory in Hampshire, the Daresbury Laboratory (DL) in Cheshire and
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, (RAL) in Chilton. The official logo is shown
above, I think the official name for the diagram is 'the swirl', but I have
yet to understand its significance.

So the CLRC news for this issue is a report by Ron Smith on the
crystallographic instruments at ISIS, one from Bill David on the successful
<a href="#sdpd95">IUCr workshop </a> held in Abingdon (read about
William Bragg's nephew), and one from Tony Holland on the setting up of <a
href="http://www.dl.ac.uk/CCP/CCP14/ >CCP14</a> for powder diffraction
 and their first Open meeting
held in Chester on another of the very hot days this summer.

<h2> Structure Determination from Powder Diffraction Data</h2>

SDPD95, an IUCr workshop focussing on structure determination from powder
diffraction data, was held at Wadham College, Oxford between 16th and 20th
July 1995. Powder diffraction is now perhaps best known for the impact that
the Rietveld method has made in the refinement of structures and, in
particular, the structures of the high temperature superconductors. Over the
past five years, however, as a result of improvements in diffraction
instrumentation and computer hardware and software, there have been major
advances in ab-initio structure determination from powder data. Judging by
the 200+ requests for registration, the field is already well-developed.
However, because of the workshop nature of the meeting, attendance was
limited to 100 participants (from 27 countries) with 20 lecturers.  <p>

 After an evening reception in the University Museum, the meeting began in
earnest on Monday with a day of introductory lectures at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory.  Tony Cheetham (Santa Barbara) gave an impressive
display of solved structures some with excess of 50 atoms in the asymmetric
unit. In conclusion, he observed that in future, the problem may not be the
solution of structures but their accurate refinement from powder data.
Daniel Louer (Rennes), Dave Cox (Brookhaven) and Bill David (ISIS)
respectively pointed out the advances in laboratory X-ray, synchrotron X-ray
and neutron powder diffraction analysis and instrumentation. This was
followed by Andy Fitch (ESRF) who showed that combining X-ray and neutron
techniques was often the most desirable approach. With only a tour of the
ISIS spallation neutron as light relief (!), the working day finished with
two talks by John Newsam and Clive Freeman (BIOSYM) who demonstrated the
powerful visualisation and simulation tools available for powder diffraction
studies.  <p>

After an exhausting seven hours of talks, the conference decamped to Lains
Barn, a converted 300-year old barn, for an evening of good food and wine in
magnificent surroundings courtesy of Dick Squires, a retired country doctor 
who had restored the barn. And here I must tell you a little story. As the
meal was finishing, Dick came up to me and said, 'Shall I say a little about
the barn?' to which I said 'Yes' and then he followed with 'I believe you
are a group of crystallographers'. As most crystallographers are aware, this
usually marks the end of the conversation, either that or the conversation
moves tangentially on to the mystical powers of crystals. So I politely
answered in the affirmative. This was followed not by silence but by the
follow-up 'My uncle was quite a famous crystallographer.' Again believing
that the end of the conversation was nigh, I enquired, expecting never to
have heard of this famous man, only to be told 'My uncle Will', 'William
Bragg'. He then added to his history of the barn some delightful anecdotes
of William Bragg that rounded off a full and eventful day. <p>

The rest of the meeting was based at Wadham College with the main lectures
taking place in the Holywell Music Room. Constructed in 1748, it is probably
the oldest public concert hall in Europe which is still in regular use. A
poster session with around 30 excellent contributions was in continuous
running during the coffee and lunch breaks. Tuesday focussed on the
principal steps of structure solution. Rod Hill (CSIRO, Melbourne)
highlighted the importance of correct sample preparation and data collection
which was followed by an explanation of powder indexing methods by Per-Erik
Werner (Stockholm). Devinder Sivia (ISIS) emphasised the advantages of a
Bayesian approach for peak finding and structure factor extraction from
powder diffraction data. Rene Peschar (Amsterdam) and Carmelo Giacovazzo
(Bari) introduced the principles of Direct Methods and their particular
application to powder diffraction data. The meeting then divided into four
groups led by tutors. This afternoon workshop format that remained the
pattern for the rest of the meeting proved to be very popular. Neither the
excellent weather nor the nearby attractions of Oxford diminished the
numbers at these parallel sessions which varied from small masterclasses,
through BIOSYM and Siemens demonstrations to tutorials based around computer
demonstrations.The Wednesday morning lectures were devoted to the MaxEnt
approach to structure solution developed by Gerard Bricogne (Cambridge &
Paris) who gave an introductory lecture on the theoretical aspects of MaxEnt
structure solution. This was followed by practical aspects and particular
problems given by Chris Gilmore (Glasgow) and Kenneth Shankland (ISIS)
respectively. After a full afternoon of tutorials and masterclasses, we were
treated to the proper use of the Holywell Music Room by the Frideswide
ensemble who, in the evening, returned us to the 18th century with arias and
music on period instruments by Purcell, Handel and Ostwald. The final day of
the meeting was devoted to an excellent appraisal of Patterson methods by
Michael Estermann (Zurich), followed by a description of old and new
applications of chemical knowledge to structure solution, particularly in
the case of zeolites by Lynne McCusker (Zurich). The final talk by Christian
Baerlocher (Zurich) was a typically restrained and refined rendition of
'Restrained refinement'. After an afternoon of tutorials and masterclasses,
the meeting ended with a excellent banquet in the magnificent  surroundings
of Wadham College Hall accompanied by the minimum of speeches. <p>

We judged the meeting to be a success. Structure determination from powder
diffraction data has developed significantly over recent years and the
meeting provided the first opportunity for a general discussion of the
problems as well as the successes. Now that you have heard about the
conference, get ready to read the book which we hope will be published in
the OUP/IUCr monograph on crystallography series! <p>
