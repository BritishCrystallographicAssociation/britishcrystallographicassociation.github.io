<h2>Financial Arrangements between BCA Council and Groups</h2>

BCA Council will be asked at its meeting in October to consider a proposal
that the present system of annual payments to each of the four interest
groups, based on the number of Ordinary members be discontinued. This is
because the practical difficulties in determining the most appropriate
values of these payments are now probably greater than their monetary value
to any of the groups. If the subventions to groups then cease, it is likely
that Council would allocate each year an equivalent sum of money to either
the Bursary Fund or for increased support of the Group Scientific Programmes
at the Spring Conference. 
<p>

Some facts related to the history of this matter are set out below. Members'
comments are welcomed and these should reach their Group Representative, or
any other member of Council, in good time before the Autumn meeting in
London on 30th October.  
<p>
 Each year BCA Council has traditionally given a per capita subvention to
those of its four constituent groups having Ordinary Members, whilst Joint
Members (whose subscription is paid indirectly via RSC and/or IoP were
excluded from consideration amongst those for whom this subvention was paid.
<p>

 Since the new BCA Membership database became available in 1994, it has become
very clear that:<br>
<ul> 
  <li>the group membership figures used previously were inaccurate and so
affected the two Joint Groups differently from the other two groups
  <li>the use of only, one group per member, i.e. a single main interest
group, does not adequately reflect the real level of support for each of the
four interest groups
  <li>the relative strengths of the four groups is different when judged by
counting either members' one main interest or all of their special interests
  <li>a few members express interest in all four groups (whilst more have
still not expressed special interest in any group), whilst most people
indicate only one group - but with a significant number marking two groups
as being of specia interest
  <li>the Bye-laws of the BCA provide for members to belong to more than one
group, on payment of a further subscription fixed by the Council
  <li>the level of such further subscription has, since the beginning of the
BCA, always been deemed by Council as being zero 
  <li>any possible introduction of real supplementary rates of subscription
would add to both the complexity of the BCA membership structure 
  <li>this structure already has so many different options that many members
wish to see simplification of the renewal form
  <li>the distinction between the two counting methods (special interest(s)
or main interest) has little significance for anything other than the
financial subvention
   <li>the separation of interest group affiliations from all monetary
factors might be a more useful step than adding to existing complexity
   <li>none of the groups are very dependent upon these subventions for their
financial security
