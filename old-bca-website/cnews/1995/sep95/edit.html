<h2><a name="it">Whither</a> the International Tables?</h2> 
      As I was making up this issue I received the latest IUCr Newsletter
(Vol 3 No.2) which begins with a letter from the President, Philip Coppens,
entitled <strong>'What is the future of the International Tables?'</strong>
<p>
  I feel sure
Arthur Wilson would want us to continue his editorial work on this valuable
resource for all Crystallographers. A new volume covering the many aspects
of macromolecular Crystallography not covered in the current Tables is being
considered.  Here are my thoughts on this problem, please let the BCA
Council know yours.<p> 

<strong>Other means of disseminating the information must be
explored. </strong>
Printing books is difficult expensive and time consuming;
CD-ROMs can be quickly and easily copied and used on the ubiquitous personal
microcomputers; when can we have the <strong>Tables on CD-ROM?</strong><p>

The growth of the World Wide Web means that soon everyone will be able to
access vast amounts of information on-line.  Perhaps  database servers could
each hold a copy of the International Tables; I think it unlikely that the
IUCr server at Chester which maintains the 'World Directory of
Crystallographers' would be able to cope with the network traffic if there
were only one copy kept at Chester.  Perhaps the  introductory type pages
could still be published in book form, with the Table pages themselves kept
on-line. Then it would be easy for users to download the few pages relevant
to their current work and print them locally.
 <strong>Let us know your ideas.</strong>

Ads like these have been put on the BCA www pages since the Easter meeting
at Cardiff.  People can see your position vacant or equipment notices very
much more quickly than waiting for 'Crystallography News' to be printed
every 4 months.   I have been adding more information to the home page; you
can now search journal contents pages, or look at publishers latest books.
The CUP ad for Michael Woolfson's new book is the first to print a WWW
address in one of our ads.<p>

The Industrial Group Newsletter is now on-line, and so is most of the
previous issue of 'Crystallography News'. Members who are wondering what
became of their Protein Data Bank Newsletter should look in the PDB pages on
the WWW to find out. They are easily found via the BCA home page, URL given
above.<p>

Please let me know of any other links you would like to to set up from this

<h2><a name="stnu">SOFTWARE</a>  DEVELOPMENT  AT  NEUTRON  SCATTERING  SOURCES</h2>
 A second workshop on
software development at neutron scattering sources, <strong>(SoftNeSS'95)</strong> is to be
held on September 21-22 1995 in the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), in the U.S.A.  The aim is to produce a draft for an
<strong>international standard format</strong> for the exchange of neutron scattering data
among neutron scattering facilities and the user community.  It is designed
to promote co-operation in future software development and to support the
user community in developing their own applications for the analysis and
visualisation of neutron scattering data.  A draft proposal can be seen on
the World Wide Web at:<br>

<h2>The<a name="ctour"> Crystallographic </a>Tourist</h2>

Arnold Beevers visits to crystallographically interesting places have given
me an idea for this new section for 'Crystallography News'. He was just
leaving for Vienna to see the 'Max Perutz' library when he sent me the text
of his article.  Members are invited to send me short articles describing
other interesting places they have seen. They may be museums such as the
Crum Brown museum which we might all visit in 1999, architecturally
interesting shapes or patterns such as the Escher murals in Holland or a
tiling on the Alhambra, in Granada, Spain.  Moreton Moore suggested building
childrens' climbing frames from more interesting shapes than cubes (Sept 94
issue 50 page12). Some countries already have such things; Istvan and
Magdolna Hargittai have published photographs of climbing frames in their
new book 'Symmetry'. There is a truncated icosahedron (the bucky ball shape)
in Hokkaido University, Japan and in Tel Aviv, Israel, there is a truncated
octahedron climbing frame.  Can anyone send me a photograph of an unusual UK
climbing frame in a polyhedral shape? Or other crystal models, mineral
collections or interactive science centres which we might visit to escape
from our computers for a little while.
