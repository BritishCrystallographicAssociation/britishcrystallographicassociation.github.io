<h1>From the President.</h1>

It is with sadness that we learnt of the death of Arthur Wilson recently,
another of our great founding fathers lost from the subject, in person but
not in legacy and memory for those of us who knew him. You are all invited
to attend his Memorial Meeting to be held on Sunday 17th September 1995 in
Cambridge. (Details are printed later in this issue). 
<p>
I have just returned from the ACA meeting in Montreal which was another
large gathering of crystallographers from the World with a good
representation from the UK. We were more than 1100 in total, with many
parallel sessions, a full general program, posters and evening sessions. Our
congratulations to Jenny Glusker and Ken Trueblood who shared the Fankuchen
Award this year in Montreal and indeed effectively also shared the award
lecture, both entertaining a packed lecture theatre. It is hard to fit it
all in and I can see that juggling the program topics for 1996 this week in
Lund will present some problems for the Program Committee. However that is
looking good at this stage and it should be an excellent meeting. 
<p>
Lund too promises to be a splendid week and presents us with plenty of
choice in a full schedule. I am looking forward to meeting our Scandinavian
colleagues on home ground and in a part of Sweden I have not yet visited.

Are you working on a 1999 logo for Glasgow?  (Submission details are printed
later in this issue).  The news there is that the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre is to undergo a major expansion and refurbishment to be
ready in 1997/8, so we will gain enormously from this, and the building
program the city is undertaking on the opposite bank of the river, including
additional medium priced hotels. Chris Gilmore and I continue to work on the
details, but we do not really get into gear until after Seattle, all being
well!
<p>
It is the Conference Season now and many of you will be on the road again
this summer. The BCA Council has supported a much increased number of
Bursaries this year to assist members at meetings, which I strongly support.
I hope to meet some of you on your travels but wish you all splendid
crystallographic and other meetings and a safe return to the new academic
year. If anyone has an interesting meeting report please send it to Kate,
especially if you have written it already for another purpose. Please also
send her news of forthcoming meetings. 
<p>
May I remind members that I will end my term of office at the Cambridge BCA
Annual meeting next Spring, and you are all invited to nominate my
successor. Send your nominations either to myself or one of the other
Officers at any time. We shall be deciding on a Council nominee in late
October. 
<p>
Congratulations to John Squire on his professorial promotion and also to
Kenneth Harris newly appointed to the Structural Chemistry Chair at
Birmingham.
<p>
Until the first of our Autumn Group Meetings.

<h3>IUCr 17, Seattle USA 9 -17 August 1996 </h3>

From your President in Lund, 3 August 1995 <br>
It is not too soon to start preparing to be there,
and what to talk about! Full details of the program will be given in the
Autumn issue of the IUCr Newsletter and the December issue of
'Crystallography News'. The Program Commitee have done their work, the
keynote speakers and microsymposia topics identified. The Call for Papers
will be  mailed in the Autumn from the US with a <strong>deadline of February 1st
1996</strong>.  This meeting will  be the first IUCr to use the World Wide Web
extensively, and as for the recent ACA in Montreal,  abstracts will be
available on the Web after acceptance.
