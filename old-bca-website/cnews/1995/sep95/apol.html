<h1> APOLOGY</h1>

   In the June Issue of BCA News, there is, a report on the Aston Intensive
Course. In preparing the list of sponsors, I carelessly omitted
Enraf-Nonius. I wish to apologise for this omission. and state that
Enraf-Nonius have been strong supporters of the Course from its very
beginnings in 1987.<p>
