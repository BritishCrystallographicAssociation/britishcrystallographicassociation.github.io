<h1>Report on meeting in 1996 to mark the publication of Dorothy
Hodgkin's Collected Works.</h1>
<p>
On July 12th the British Crystallographic Association 
organised a meeting at the Royal Society, to mark the 
publication of Dorothy Hodgkin's collected papers by the 
Indian Academy of Science. The meeting was initiated and 
planned by Sivaraj Ramaseshan, Judith Howard and Guy 
Dodson to provide an opportunity to review the current 
state of research areas where Dorothy had made major and 
often the first contributions. The topics of discussion were 
cholesterol, penicillin, Vitamin B12, proteins (specifically 
pepsin-related enzymes and insulin), as well as current and 
future developments in crystallography. The papers span 
her scientific career from 1935 to 1989, their importance 
lies in their crystallographic skill and originality and 
because they helped to change the way that chemists 
thought and because they signalled the importance of 
structural knowledge to both chemistry and biology.

Lord Phillips of Ellesmere, better known to the community 
as David, delivered the opening remarks, identifying 
Dorothy's particular influence on the crystallographic 
careers of most of the speakers, and also many of the 
audience. He used the quotation from A Midsummers 
Nights Dream to illustrate the scientific imagination many 
had felt Dorothy was capable of: 
<p>
<em>The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, <br>
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; <br>
And, as imagination bodies forth, <br>
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen  <br>
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing <br>
A local habitation and a name. </em><br>

The first session, on cholesterol, was opened by David Blow. 
He surveyed the early studies by Crowfoot and Bernal of 
sterol crystals. They had extracted a great deal of 
information about possible structures from knowledge of 
the chemical composition, and the unit cell. He pointed out 
that the early conflicts over the form of the steroids, 
reported in the Journals of 1933, would have been well-
known to Dorothy, and were in acute contrast to her own 
approach to scientific discussion and publication. The 
recent extensive research on the chemistry of the steroid-
binding enzymes was described by David Blow and Bill 
Duax, the second speaker. The displacement of water 
molecules from the binding site of cholesterol 
oxidase was analysed in detail by David Blow while 
Bill Duax presented a lively account of the 
specificity of short-chain dehydrogenases and the 
effect of liquorice on blood pressure. 
<p>
 The penicillin session was devoted entirely to discussion of 
the crystal structure of isopenicillin N synthase determined 
in Oxford. (This work carries on the tradition of Oxford 
chemistry; Chaim, Abrahams and Dorothy were all involved 
in early work on antibiotics.) Peter Roach demonstrated 
how the knowledge of the structure allows an 
understanding of the details of the extraordinary chemistry 
by which the beta lactam and thiol rings are closed during 
the synthetic reaction. 
<p>
The exciting new structure of methylmalonyl CoA-mutase 
was described by Phil Evans. It requires the co-factor 
adenosyl-cobalamin and generates a free radical in its 
mechanism of action. It was shown that there is a large 
conformational change on binding of this cofactor, and as a 
result the benzimidazole is replaced by a histidine from the 
enzyme. Jenny Glusker's talk approached the structure 
from a different viewpoint. She described attempts to 
model the conformational variability of the enzyme, and 
presented some ab initio molecular orbital data on the free 
radical rearrangement that occurs in methionine synthase, 
another B12 utilising enzyme. A lively discussion was 
triggered by these two complementary presentations.
<p>
The protein session reflected Dorothy's deep interest in 
proteins and her recognition of their importance to 
biochemistry and medical science. The complexity of 
protein molecules obviously presented huge 
crystallographic problems (insoluble at the time), which 
however did not deter Dorothy from their study. In 1934 
Dorothy and J D Bernal reported in Nature the first X-ray 
diffraction pattern obtained from a protein, pepsin. They 
predicted " ...... now that a crystalline protein has been 
made to give X-ray photographs, it is clear that we have the 
means of checking them and, by examining the structure of 
all crystalline proteins, arriving at far more detailed 
conclusions about protein structure than previous physical 
or chemical methods have been able to give".
<p>
Tom Blundell looked at the aspartic proteinase family 
whose members are present in a wide variety of organisms 
and some of which most notably HIV protease and renin, 
are targets for structure-based drug design. 
<p>
When Dorothy went to Oxford she began research into 
insulin's structure a commitment for the rest of her 
working life. The structure determination of insulin has led 
directly to the design of mutant insulins now being used in 
diabetic therapy. and in his presentation Guy Dodson went 
on to discuss how structural knowledge is being applied to 
the phenomenon of insulin fibril formation. 
<p>
The final session was of general interest. Jack Dunitz gave 
an overview of what crystallography has contributed to 
chemistry, biochemistry, and physics. He pointed out 
something implicit in the discussion after the B12 papers 
viz. crystallographers prefer molecules to be stable, 
whereas chemists are most interested in molecules as part 
of a reaction process. The chemical approach can be based 
on the comprehensive and accessible data bases now 
available 
<p>
Michael Rossmann summarised the state of play in the 
macromolecular field. He foresees the subject becoming 
increasingly rigorous and more and more being driven by 
the molecular biologists with structural analyses becoming 
one weapon in the armoury for attacking biological 
questions. 
<p>
Finally Max Perutz was asked to comment on the challenges 
facing scientists in the 1930s compared to those of the 
1990s struggling to understand the immense complexity of 
molecular biology. Interestingly he felt (with hindsight!) 
that the problems he and Dorothy faced were simpler - 
they knew that if they had better techniques their 
problems could be solved, whereas now more knowledge is 
not leading to simplification, if anything the reverse. 
<p>
Many of those who had worked with Dorothy in Oxford 
stayed on for a most enjoyable dinner at which Siv 
Ramasechan reminisced about Dorothy's influence and 
travels in India.
