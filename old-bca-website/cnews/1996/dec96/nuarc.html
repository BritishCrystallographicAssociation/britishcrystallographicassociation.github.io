<h1>Archives of Crystallographers</h1>
<p>
The National Cataloguing Unit for the Archives of Contemporary Scientists
(NCUACS) was established in the University Library at Bath in April 1987
under the auspices of the Royal Society. It is the successor to the
Oxford-based Contemporary Scientific Archives Centre (CSAC). The NCUACS's
mission is to locate, sort, catalogue and find permanent places of deposit
for the manuscript papers of distinguished contemporary British scientists
and engineers, and in this way preserve and make accessible the original
source materials for the history of science. As a small unit whose work
covers the whole range of scientific disciplines, the NCUACS must be highly
selective in respect of the scientists in whose papers it takes an interest,
and thus has an Advisory Committee with strong Royal Society representation
to assist in this important task. The Unit is a processing centre rather
than a repository; it does not retain the papers it locates and catalogues. 
<p>
      Since the establishment of the CSAC in 1973 the scientific archives
project at Oxford and now Bath has catalogued some 180 collections of
scientists' papers for deposit in 45 repositories usually academic libraries
and archives throughout Britain. The collections of papers of
crystallographers catalogued by the Unit are listed below, with the place of
deposit, the catalogue reference number, and the length of the catalogue:

 <li> William Thomas Astbury (Brotherton Library, University of Leeds,<br>
 CSAC catalogue no.33/10/75, 53pp.) 
 <li>Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin 	(Bodleian Library, 
University of Oxford,<br> NCUACS catalogue no.47/3/94, 362 pp.) 
 <li>John Cowdery Kendrew 	(Bodleian Library, University of Oxford,<br>

 <li>David Chilton Phillips 	(Bodleian Library, University of Oxford,<br>
 NCUACS catalogue no.45/1/94, 437 pp.) 
 <li>Herbert Marcus Powell 	(Bodleian Library, University of Oxford,<br> 
NCUACS catalogue no. 58/1/96 42 pp.)

    The potential for records of classic crystallographical investigations
such as those on penicillin, vitamin B12, insulin, myoglobin and lysozyme is
obvious. However, the research activities and scientific careers of
scientists are not the only areas of interest that may be documented in
their manuscript papers. The papers may very well record other aspects of
their lives such as education, family connexions, the development of the
profession, the direction of a university department or laboratory, public
service and so on. But of course, the content of each collection varies
according to pattern of the scientists' careers, their methods of working
and according to their own attitudes to the preservation of their papers. 
<p>
    It is important to note that the deposit of a scientist's papers in a
library or archive does not necessarily mean that all the papers are
available for research. Questions of confidentiality in recent papers are
taken very seriously and there may accordingly be restrictions on access.
Researchers should always consult the library or archive before planning a
visit.

    Lists of all the catalogues of scientists papers compiled by the
scientific archives project from 1973 and descriptions of the papers are
available on the NCUACS website: <br>

    Accounts of the NCUACS's work on the papers of Herbert Marcus Powell and
Dorothy Hodgkin appeared in the June 1996 issue of 'Crystallography News'
and 'Acta Cryst.' D52 (1996) respectively. The catalogues themselves may be
consulted in the Science Museum Library, London and the Library of the Royal
Society, and are also available for purchase direct from the Unit. <br>
