<h1> Industrial Group  Reflectivity Workshop</h1>
<HR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
Held at Raychem, Swindon, 17 September 1996
</p>
<P>
The introduction of thin-film attachments for conventional XRD equipment and
the ability to collect high quality data easily has made reflectometry a
viable analytical technique for industry. The results provide accurate data
on both the thickness of layered coatings and the interfacial roughness. The
aim of this meeting was to gain a basic understanding of the theory of x-ray
reflectivity and experimental techniques, as well as having a forum to
discuss various problems and ideas. A discussion of neutron reflectometry
was also included to highlight its uses as a complementary technique. The
meeting was attended by industrial xrd users, and included presentations by
both academics and representatives from the equipment manufacturers, Bede,
Philips and Siemens. 

<P> Professor Brian Tanner (University of Durham) gave a lecture entitled
`Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering: Not Just the Specular Reflection'. The
theory of x-ray reflectivity and the advantages of using both the specular
and diffuse reflections as well as several examples and results were
included, and  a summary of all the points was provided. The limitations of
low angle scattering and the need for a methodical technique to provide
accurate results were discussed. 

<P> Professor Julia Higgins continued the theoretical aspect in her
`Introduction to Neutron Reflectivity' lecture, and gave examples of her
work in the field of polymer coatings. 

<P> Each of the three instrument manufacturing companies represented then
gave a short talk detailing their respective hardware and software,
including the latest developments in software for fitting diffuse scattering
data in interpreting the results. The REFS and GIXS systems from Bede, GIXA
and WINGIXA software (for DOS and Windows respectively) from Philips and
Refsim for Windows from Siemens were all explained. There was some
discussion with the manufacturers  about the capabilities of the hardware on
offer. 

<P> After lunch there was a short discussion of both theoretical and
practical aspects, including advice on alignment and data collection. Dr
Devinder Sivia (RAL) then talked about data reduction and analysis in
neutron reflectometry using Bayseian techniques. 

<P> Dr Robert Richardson (Bristol University) spoke about in-plane structure
and roughness from neutron reflectivity results, including the type of data
taken to achieve specific results. 

<P> The afternoon ended with a question and answer session, and a discussion
of the problems faced by first time users and their own solutions, as well
as advice from the equipment manufacturers and Professor Tanner. 

<P> Those attending the meeting felt it had been both helpful and
informative, with the techniques and theory fully explained. It was seen
that x-ray reflectivity was indeed a useful and accurate analytical
technique for industry and, with practice, was simple to use.
