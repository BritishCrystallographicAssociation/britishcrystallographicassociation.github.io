<h1>Report on the Open Commission Meeting on
            International Tables for Crystallography</h1>
 <h2> Seattle, August 12, 1996</h2>
 <h3> Session Chair: Theo Hahn, Aachen, Germany</h3>
  <h3> Session Co-chair: Uri Shmueli, Tel Aviv, Israel</h3>

The editors of the three published (A, B, C) and the four proposed  (D, E,
A1, A2) volumes of International Tables reported on the present  status and
the future plans of their volumes. 
<p> 
 Th. Hahn demonstrated two new features of the Fourth Edition (1995)  of
<strong>Volume A,</strong>
 "Space-Group Symmetry": completion of the space-group  diagram
project for all 17 plane and 230 space groups, and  introduction of the
"double glide plane" e by means of new graphical  symbols for 17 space-group
diagrams and modifications of five  orthorhombic space-group symbols.  <p>
 
 The plans for the Second Edition of <strong>Volume B,</strong>
 "Reciprocal Space",  were
presented by the editor U. Shmueli. In addition to minor  corrections and
major revisions of several existing chapters the  Second Edition will
contain five new contributions on the following  topics:
<ol>
 <li>Space-group representations in reciprocal space.
 <li>Direct methods in electron crystallography.
 <li>Diffraction by polymers.
 <li>Reciprocal-space images of aperiodic crystals. 
 <li>Dynamical theory of neutron diffraction.
</ol>
This edition is scheduled for publication in 1997. 
<p> 
 The editor of <strong>Volume C,</strong> "Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Tables",
E.Prince, explained that the preparations for the Second Edition of  this
Volume (scheduled for publication in 1997) were about 85%  complete at the
time of death of the previous editor, A.J.C. Wilson.  The rest is presently
being edited. Due to rapid obsolence of much of  the tabular material in
this volume, an electronic version of Vol. C  is presently under active
consideration. 
<p>
  The new <strong>Volume D,</strong> "Physical Properties of Crystals", scheduled for  1997,
was introduced by its editor A. Authier. It consists of three  parts: 
<ul>
 <li>Part 1 treats Tensorial Aspects of Physical Properties; it contains
  both the general mathematical background and the individual physical
  properties.
  <li>Part 2 is devoted to the Symmetry Aspects of Excitations (phonons, 
electrons, Raman scattering, Brillouin scattering).
 <li> Part 3 is devoted to the
Symmetry Aspects of Structural Phase  Transitions, Twinning and Domain
Structures.
 </ul> 
 Relevant tables will be included in an accompanying diskette or CD  ROM. 
<p>
  The new <strong>Volume E,</strong> "Subperiodic Groups", is edited by V. Kopsky and  D.B.
Litvin. Its publication is planned for 1997. The volume is  devoted mainly
to layer and rod groups, i.e. to groups in three  dimensions with lattices
of only two or one dimensions. 

 The volume consists of two parts:
<ul>
 <li> Part 1: Subperiodic group tables: Frieze, Rod and Layer Groups. 
 <li>Part 2: Scanning of space groups, i.e. layer groups as subgroups of          space groups. 
 </ul> 
<p>       
 <strong>Volume A1,</strong> "Maximal Subgroups of Space and Plane Groups", was  introduced
by its editor H. Wondratschek. It is a companion volume to  Vol. A,
containig the maximal subgroups of space and plane groups.  Maximal
subgroups of indices 2, 3, and 4 will be listed individually.  The
infinitely many maximal isomorphic subgroups will be presented by  series
with the index as parameter. Conjugacy relations will be  indicated. 
 <p>
 The final project of the session was presented by T. Janssen:
<strong>Volume A2,</strong> 
"N-Dimensional Crystallography". This volume consists of a  computer
programme (CD-ROM) and an accompanying printed volume with a  manual and a
treatment of the theory of symmetry in arbitrary  dimension. This implies
that it gives the information on two- and  three-dimensional point groups as
well. For more than three  dimensions these groups are used already by
crystallographers dealing  with incommensurate phases and quasicrystals.
From a data base are  calculated the space groups, the symmetry elements,
the Wyckoff  positions, the general and special extinction rules, in short
all  that can be found in the existing tables for 2 and 3 dimensions.
