The Crum Brown Beevers Museum <br>
in the CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT of the UNIVERSITY of EDINBURGH, West Mains Road, 
Edinburgh, EH9 3JJ
<P>
This small Museum was begun by Alexander Crum Brown, who was Professor of
Chemistry in Edinburgh from l869 to l908. Crum Brown had very wide chemical
interests, and had publications in fields of organic chemistry, physical
chemistry, and the applications of mathematics to chemistry. He also had a
deep interest in crystallography, and the Museum contains many relics of
this. <BR>

The most surprising exhibit is a model of the structure of Rock Salt made
from knitting needles held together by balls of coloured wool. The structure
is exactly that finally proved by the Braggs in 1914, and it shows that:
Crum Brown had realised the ionic nature of the structure, whereas most
chemists at the time believed in a molecular structure. Other Museum objects
of crystallographic interest are a fine collection of single crystals by
Goldberg of Heidelberg, a collection of cardboard models of crystal forms by
Krantz, and a fine optical goniometer by Fuess. There are also some
Ha&uuml;y models showing crystal forms with the faces stepped to illustrate
the unit cell theory of crystal structure. 

<P>
There are two exhibits which show Crum Brown's international interests. One
is a reprint sent to him by Mendel&eacute;ev, signed and dated 1884.
Mendel&eacute;ev was a house-guest of Brown on the occasion of the
University of Edinburgh's 300th anniversary in 1884. The other is an etching
of Paul von Groth. This is a copy of a portrait made of Groth in Munich in
1904. This portrait was originated by a British committee in 1903 to
commemorate 25 years of Groth's editorship of the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
Kristallographie". Evidently Crum Brown was a subscriber and was sent a
copy. Our copy is in better condition than the original which I saw in
Munich in March 1995.

The Museum contains a number of balances, two-pan types with lots of boxes
of weights, ranging from student balances to sensitive analytical
instruments. One is sufficiently sturdy to take one-litre flasks of water
for calibration  purposes. There is also a fragile Westphal balance for
surface tension  measurements. We also have many electrical items, various
galvanometers  (by Tinsley and Cambridge Instruments). 

<P>
There is a String Galvanometer and a String Electrometer. These were for the 
measurement of rapidly changing currents and voltages respectively. Among
many other artefacts we have some films made by I. Traube showing Brownian
Movement, and a couple of splendid Beckman Thermometers. These were used, of
course, for the measurement of small changes in freezing or boiling points. 

<P>
 Among the instruments we have a number of Microscopes, some with unusual
features, and a number of Refractometers, some very accurate ones by
Abb&eacute;. For many years the subject of Chemistry in Edinburgh was taught
essentially by one man, the Professor, who also collected the fee for the
course. We still have in the Museum the small brass device for testing the
guineas given; there was a class of student who would present "light
guineas"! 

<P>
 We have a projector for the old "quarter plate" lantern slides, and a set
of slides of University buildings and notables including Lord Lister, of
antiseptic fame. There is a printed copy of lecture notes from Joseph
Black's course in 1766-68 and a set of student's notes from the lectures of
Crum Brown (1910). we have portraits of all the Professors of Chemistry from
1755. 

<P>
 A great deal of computing has gone on in the Department in the past and we
have a good collection of computing devices and machines, notably several
sets of the Beevers-Lipson strips. These were used for many years in X-ray
Crystallographic Laboratories for the calculation of Fourier maps.  A
complete list of the contents of the Museum can be obtained by writing to me
at the Museum.

   <BR><strong><em>John Robertson</em></strong> has sent details of two
museums his grand children found fascinating. If you visit either of them,
why not ask whether they might like to borrow the BCA blocks, (shown at the
Cardiff Spring meeting) as an exhibit for a few months?
