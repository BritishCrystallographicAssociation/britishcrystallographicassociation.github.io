<h1><a name="rsgrant">THE ROYAL SOCIETY </a>BLOCK GRANT FOR SEATTLE</h1>

<strong>REMEMBER :</strong> REGISTRATION DEADLINE IS JUNE 1ST.<br>

The BCA were asked to administer this grant for travel to Seattle, under the
auspicies of the Royal Society, as an experiment this year.  A Royal Society
approved working party was set up, members of which had no claims on the
grant and who also covered the spectrum of subject groups in the BCA.  A
deadline of January 31st was published widely on the web and in the BCA
Newsletter and the sub-committee met a month later.  The time scale was such
to allow the outcome of the allocation to be known, in conjunction with
applications made elsewhere by the same applicants, well ahead of the IUCr
Registration deadline in June.<p>

This grant was very much over subscribed, but thanks to the Royal Society,
the UK will have a significant presence in Seattle.  The Royal Society rules
applied to this grant in the same way as any individual applications to the
Society, which meant that very worthy applicants were ineligible for
funding.   The grant has just been released by the Royal Society (May 1st)
and cheques will be issued against this as soon as possible.  If you haven't
yet claimed your grant, please do so immediately or let us know that you are
not now in a position to use the funds.<p> 

This is to be the end of the Block Grants scheme and in the future all
applicants must apply directly to the Society's travel fund. It seems that
another society asked to set up and run a similar exercise but they gave the
Society a great deal more work than if they done the job themselves and this
has now resulted in a cessation of the scheme.  There will be no further
Block Grants made available from the Royal Society, but of course we should
not have been granted one in 1999 since we are seen to be on 'home ground'
in Glasgow.  Perhaps the BCA should devise another scheme for both 1999 and 
2002??<p>
