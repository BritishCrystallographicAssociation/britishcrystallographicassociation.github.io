<p>
Peter Seymour of the Russell Society has compiled this devilishly hard word
square for your amusement. (Yes, I do know it is not square!)  A prize of
&pound;10 is offered for the first correct solution received by the editor.  
If you fancy a challenge, try finding the 44 minerals and elements without
looking at the list below.  The usual rules apply, letters must be adjacent
running in one direction, but they can be read forwards, backwards, or
diagonally.</p>

<h2><a name="61">Prize</a> Competition No 61 June  1997</h2>
<h3>List the Prizewinners</h3>
This month's competition arises out of an email I had recently asking for
help with a student project by sending the enquirer a list of all the Nobel
Prize Winners in Crystallography. Unfortunately I did not have a list, so I
am asking you to help me to help to educate any future enquirers by making a
list for me.  A £10 book token will be awarded for the most complete and
appropriate list of Nobel Prize Winners whose work can be classed as
relevant to crystallography. I do not just want a list of all the winners in
Physics and Chemistry, only those of crystallographic interest. Extra
information such as titles of relevant books, or URL of associated Web sites
will be useful

Entries should list the Prize winner's name, which Prize it was, the year of
the award and the subject of the research.  Entries should be submitted to
the editor at the address on the next page before midnight on 1st August
1997.

<h2><a name="62">Prize</a> Competition No 62 September 1997</h2>
<h3>Prove Kepler's Conjecture?</h3>
<p>
On 28  June 1997 the '<em>New Scientist</em>'  published an article stating
that in 1611 Kepler wrote a paper concluding that the most efficient way to
stack cannonballs was in what we now call a face centred cubic lattice.<br>

<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE alt="cubic packing" src="sep97.gif">
<P>
(page 30 '<em>Packing them in</em>' by Simon Singh a TV producer)
Apparently Kepler merely <strong><em>stated </em></strong>that this
arrangement was the best one he had found; after nearly 400 years some
people are still trying to prove there is no other more efficient one.  This
was a great surprise to me, since I assumed it had been proved long ago. Do
you know of any attempts to prove it?   A &pound;10 book token is offered
for the best explanation of how people have tried to prove it, or a list of
references to published papers on the topic.   Replies to the editor at the
address on the next page by the deadline for publication of the next issue.

<hr>
<h2><a name="63">Prize</a> Competition No 63 December 1997</h2>
<h3>List educational Internet sites</h3>
Surf the Internet to win a valuable textbook
The Oxford University Press have generously donated the prize for this
educational competition, a paperback copy of <em><strong>'The Basics of 
Crystallography and Diffraction',</strong></em>  reviewed on an earlier page
 in this issue.   The
competition is to make an educational Web page for the BCA site, with
working links to educational crystallographic World Wide Web sites and as
much explanatory text and diagrams as you think necessary. The sites may be
for the general public trying to explain the uses of crystallography, ( for
example 'What's inside your quartz watch', or 'Good recipes for Growing
Crystals') or for undergraduates, such things as an explanation of Fourier
Transforms. Remember that some people will have little old computers with
slow lines and early versions of browsers, so write for the earliest
possible version of HTML which can show your pages well. The winner will be
the person who submits the best page to the editor, preferably by email to
BCA@isise.rl.ac.uk  on or <strong>before 6 February 1998.</strong>
<p>
<em>Editor's Note:</em> Although the deadline above is long past I am always
 happy to receive news of educational sites. Please send them to the

<h2><a name="64">Prize</a> Competition No 64 March 1998</h2>
  <h3>Name the Mineral</h3>

This is a multi-part competition to advertise the National Minerals Week which starts in London on 22 June and continues at various locations throughout the summer.
<br>The diagram below represents a particular form of a common mineral. The
competition is to identify the mineral giving its name and that of this
common form, say where it is found and what are its main uses.  Entries to
the editor at the address overleaf by 8th May 1998. The prize is a £10 book
token.<br>

<img align=middle src="mar98.gif" alt="mystery mineral"><br>

You may get some inspiration by copying and enlarging this page, and then
constructing your own paper mineral, by cutting round the solid outline,
bending along the dotted lines and sticking the tabs to the other sides.

  <h3>Define the TLAs</h3>

<P>
Authors happily use three letter acronyms (TLAs) in their articles without
realising that their readers may not all be familiar with the meanings.  The
list below contains common (?) abbreviations with 3, 4 or even 5 letters,
which have all appeared in 'Crystallography News', and one which the author
assures me is a trade name, so he cannot define it.  <BR>The competition is
to identify the 'trade name' and define the others. In the event of a tie,
preference will be given to those who produce several definitions for the
same TLA, preferably associated with crystallography in some way. (There is
one of these in this issue.) Credit will also be given for additional
appropriate TLAs and their definitions to form a glossary for use by the
editor and future authors of 'Crystallography News'.

<h3>List UK Crystallographers</h3>
<P>
Since there were no entries for the last competition, 'Define the TLAs', I
have decided to 'roll-over' the prize because I need your help and advice.
The winner of this competition will receive a <strong>£20 book token</strong>.  
On an earlier page I explained that I am preparing a list of UK scientists,
either crystallographers, or people without whom crystallography today would
be very different.   The winner will be the person who submits the best list
to me at the address overleaf by <strong>6th November 1998. </strong>For each
scientist give as complete a name as possible, relevant dates, birth, death,
when they did the work (approximately), a sentence explaining why they are
listed, and location(s)  associated with them or their work. I hope to turn
this into a UK tourist guide to crystallographic sites.  Any extra
information is welcome, for example an OS Grid Reference to enable people to
find the location, telephone numbers of museums, a bibliographic reference
to the work done, or the URL of a Web site for further information, etc.

<h2><a name="68">Prize</a> Competition No 68 March 1999</h2>

This word square contains 35 common crystallographic words which can be
found in any undergraduate textbook.  The usual rules apply, letters must be
on adjacent squares running in one direction, horizontally, vertically or
diagonally, they can be read forwards or backwards. Some letters occur in
more than one word

You might set it as a test for your students, find the words and define their
meaning.

In addition there is a 'tie-breaker', a 6 letter word, nothing to do with
crystallography. You have to find this word and define it.
 
 A prize of a £10 book token is offered for the first correct solution
received by the editor from a BCA member before 7 May 1999.

<h2>Puzzle- Where were these diagrams printed?</h2>
<p>
The early crystallographers had a highly developed visual acuity due to
their spending a lot of time looking at diffraction spots on film and trying
to see what structures made them. Modern computers do most of this work for
you, so I have devised this puzzle for you to ponder over in your coffee
breaks.   The diagram below contains many logos and other diagrams which
have all appeared in 'Crystallography News' since I became editor. How many
diagrams are there?  Whose logos are they?  I have removed the letters from
some of them, to give you more of a challenge.  Sorry, no book token prize
this time, the answers will be posted on the BCA Web Site before 1 January
2001. <a href="dec00.gif">Click here </a> to see the diagrams.
