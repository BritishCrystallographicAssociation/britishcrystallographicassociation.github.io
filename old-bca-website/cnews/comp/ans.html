<BR><B>Crystallographic word square</B><BR>
<HR>
<P>
I was afraid that this competition was too difficult because I had not given you the list of words, but there was an enthusiastic response. The winner was Steve Spratt from Johnson  Matthey who has been sent the prize book token.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src="mar99.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HEIGHT=392 WIDTH=405><BR>

<BR>The 35 crystallographic words were:
<p><br>
biaxial, close packed, cubic, diad, diffraction, face centred, faults, 
glide plane, hexad, hexagonal, intensity, interstitial, inversion, ionic, 
lattice, monoclinic, motif, orthorhombic, pentad, powder, reciprocal,
 rhombohedral, rotation, screw axis, space group, symmetry, tetragonal, 
tetrahedral, transform, translation, triad, triclinic, trigonal, twinning, 
zone.<br>
<P>
The tie-breaker word was 'IAMBIC' shown shaded in the diagram. It describes
a form of poetry where verses end in two syllables, a short one followed by
a long one, or an unstressed one followed by a stressed one.
<p>
Some people found two occurences of a word I had not thought of 'line'.
You may like to look for these too.

All of these diagrams have been printed in Crystallography News in the last
5 years, <a href="dec00a.gif">Click here</a> to see the diagrams in their
more usual size and orientation and in which issue they were printed. A few
of the more popular logos are in most issues, so they do not have a page and 
issue number to identify them.
