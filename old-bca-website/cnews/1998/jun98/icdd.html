<strong><BR>INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR DIFFRACTION DATA (ICDD)<BR></strong>CRYSTALLOGRAPHY SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS<BR>
<HR>
<P>
     The science of crystallography has played a key role in the development
of X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction and neutron diffraction for the
elucidation of the atomic structure of matter. Crystallography is an
interdisciplinary branch of science taught in departments of physics,
chemistry, geology, molecular biology, metallurgy and material science. To
encourage promising graduate students to pursue
crystallographically-oriented research, the ICDD has established a
Crystallography Scholarship Fund. <BR>     While the Ewald Prize is awarded
every three years to an internationally recognized crystallographer, little
effort has been made by science departments to cultivate aspiring
crystallographers. Convinced of the beneficial, scientific impact of the
proposed scholarships for  crystallographically-oriented research, the ICDD
has solicited funds from private and industrial sectors to support this
program. The ICDD has awarded two scholarships in 1992, two in 1993, three
in 1994, three in 1995, four in 1996, four in 1997, and five in 1998.
Applications for the 1999 awards must be received by ICDD no later than 31
October 1998.

<P>
<strong><em>Qualifications for the applicant</em>:</strong> The applicant
should be a graduate student seeking a degree with major interest in
crystallography e.g.crystal structure analysis, crystal morphology,
modulated structures, correlation of atomic structure with physical
properties, systematic classification of crystal structures, phase
identification and materials characterization. There are no restrictions on
country, race, age or sex.The term of the scholarship is one year.
Application for one renewal may be made by the recipient at the end of the
first year. Because a limited number of scholarships are awarded, renewal
applications will be considered on a competitive basis in conjunction with
all applications that have been submitted up to the closing date.
 
<P>
<strong><em>Applicants should submit:</em></strong>
<UL>
<LI>Curriculum Vitae, listing degree(s) held and degree(s) sought.
<LI>A one-page proposal by the graduate student describing the type of 
crystallographic research to be partially supported by scholarship.
<LI>A supportive letter from the sponsoring professor of an accredited 
university or an institute of technology on institution letterhead.
</UL>
<P>
<strong><em>Restrictions on the scholarship fund:</em></strong>
<UL>
<LI>The scholarship stipend of $2,000 is to be used by the graduate student 
to help defray tuition and laboratory fees.
<LI>A portion of the stipend may be applied to registration fees to accredited
 scientific meetings related to crystallography.
<LI>No more than one scholarship will be awarded to applicants at any one 
accredited institution per year.
<LI>The funds of the scholarship are not to be used for travel.
</UL>
<P>
The awarding of the scholarships is administered by a committee consisting
of the ICDD Chairman, the Chairman of the ICDD Technical Committee, the
Chairman of the ICDD Education Subcommittee, and one or two individuals
without conflict of interest. One or more accredited professors (with no
conflicts of interest) may be invited to assist in the selection of
successful candidates. <strong>Applications must be received by 31 October
1998</strong>. Please mail to:
