<h1>
Report on CCG Sessions at St.Andrews</h1>

<P>
       The CCG session on Supramolecular Structure began with <strong>Jeremy
Sanders</strong> (Cambridge) speaking about his "<em>Adventures in Molecular
Recognition</em>", which covered two aspects of molecular recognition in
supramolecular chemistry: (i) the assembly and properties of
metalloporphyrin oligomers using metal-ligand interactions, and (ii) the
construction of catenanes via donor-acceptor interactions. The first part
showed how the combination of reversible zinc-amine interactions with
irreversible carbon-carbon bond formation led to a rich variety of new
receptors which could be prepared using templated chemistry. His cyclic
porphyrin trimers are able to influence the rate and stereochemical outcome
of reactions within their cavities.  The primary structural tools used in
this work are solution state NMR and UV/visible spectroscopies:  solubility
considerations dictate the use of long floppy sidechains and large amounts
of solvent are occluded so crystal structures are rare: they are useful for
rationalising events after they have happened, but are rarely in time to
have predictive value.  Good structures from powder diffraction are urgently
needed!   By contrast the design of successive generations of catenane in
the second half of the talk was driven at every stage by single crystal
structures that gave key information about the geometry of intermolecular
(or intercomponent) non-bonded interactions.  Structures obtained on Station
9.8 of the Daresbury SRS were central to this work as the crystals of such
molecules are so tiny.

    <strong>Neil Champness </strong>(Nottingham) described the synthesis of
Cu(I) and Ag(I) inorganic supramolecular networks, with emphasis on the use
of building-block design for achieving control of network structure.
Examples were provided of how ligand, anion and metal fragment functionality
has been used to control the construction of inorganic arrays.  For example,
in some Cu(I) complexes the degree of interpenetration can be varied. Anion
functionality has also been studied in related Ag(I)-bipyridyl systems, one
result being the synthesis of the first example of a polymeric helical
staircase structure. Copper(I) halides have been used to construct inorganic
arrays incorporating a range of motifs, including
Cu<SUB>2</SUB>X<SUB>2</SUB> dimers, Cu<SUB>4</SUB>X<SUB>4</SUB> cubanes and
Cu<SUB>4</SUB>X<SUB>4</SUB> ladders.  This has allowed the construction of a
range of uncharged inorganic networks that contain channels and cavities for
solvent inclusion, some of which maintain their structural integrity even
upon desolvation.

    <strong>Guy Orpen </strong>(Bristol) spoke on "<em>Intermolecular
Interactions involving Metal Complexes</em>", comparing the intermolecular
contacts seen in organic moieties to those in metal complexes. The systems
studies included M-Cl, Cl- and C-Cl; M-NO<SUB>2</SUB>,
NO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> and C-NO<SUB>2</SUB>; and M-OC(O)R, RCO<SUB>2
</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> and R'OC(O)R and the Cambridge Structural Database
provided data on the frequency and geometry of the hydrogen bonds they form,
which allows assessments to be made of their usefulness as hydrogen bond
acceptors. <em>Ab inito</em> calculations were carried out on some
representative examples. The metal-bound ligands appear to be stronger
acceptors than their carbon-bound analogues, although still weaker than the
free anions. Such studies are being applied to supramolecular engineering,
bio-inorganic chemistry and crystal engineering, with exceptional examples
exploited as design leads.

    <strong>Jacqui Cole</strong> (Kent), in a lecture entitled
"<em>Designing Non-linear Optical Materials: Supramolecular
Requirements</em>", described the essential structure/property relationships
for non-linear optical materials. In particular, the inherent link between
the second harmonic generation (SHG) effect and supramolecular structure was
detailed, including examples where the magnitude of the SHG output can only
be explained when one considers intermolecular interactions, packing effects
and the phase-matching ability of a material.  The intramolecular and
intermolecular structures therefore have a synergic relationship.

    Under the title "<em>TTF Derivatives and Charge-Transfer Complexes:
Molecular Flexibility and Packing</em>" <strong>Andrei Batsanov</strong>
(Durham) reviewed the crystal packing and conformational flexibility of
structures containing tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and suggested that molecular
planarity may be the result rather than the cause of stack formation.  The
folding of the dithiole rings, giving a boat conformation, offers a route to
increased dimensionality for organic metals: substituents increase the
folding while oxidation reduces it.  The overlap of TTF moieties in a stack
was rationalised in orbital terms, and it was shown that this could explain
the change in the nature of the overlap upon oxidation. Hydrogen bonds and
other specific interactions between substituents have been used (with mixed
success) to influence the crystal packing, but directed synthesis of organic
conductors remains beyond reach.

   The CCG Oral Poster session was orchestrated with great efficiency by
<strong>Bob Gould</strong> and there were almost forty CCG posters exhibited
in the main CCG poster session.  <BR>The judges awarded the poster prize to
<strong>P. Guionneau </strong>(Durham) and the runner-up was P.A. Thomas
(Warwick).  Also commended were posters by A. Fitch (Keele) and R.Gregson 
(St Andrews).

<H1>Report on  CCG Workshop on Twinning -  </h1>Tuesday 7th April 1998
<P >
With the advent of more powerful radiation sources and more sensitive
detectors for diffracted X-ray photons, it is becoming possible to obtain
viable datasets from previously intractable crystals.  However, many of
these marginal samples will be affected by problems such as twinning and the
Chemical Crystallography Group (CCG) therefore invited <strong>Dr Regine
Herbst-Irmer </strong>of the University of G&ouml;ttingen, an acknowledged 
expert in this area, to present a Workshop. Approximately 40 people attended.

<P>
Regine began by defining twins and giving simple examples of twinning, twin
laws and fractional contributions before detailing the four different types
of twinning: merohedral, pseudo-merohedral, reticular merohedral and
non-merohedral.  She then presented a number of detailed examples of the
different types, their diagnosis and their treatment in refinement. She
compared the use of twin laws to disorder modelling in twinned crystals and
showed the former not only gave superior results but did so at the expense
of only one additional refinement variable.

<P>
Dr Eric Hovestreydt of Bruker AXS contributed a short presentation on
software being developed by Bob Sparks for automatic treatment of
non-merohedral twins on both area detector and four-circle diffractometers. 
The basic algorithm involves indexing groups of reflections from different
twin components and extracting the twin law relating them.

<P>
Regine wound up the Workshop by providing some characteristic warning signs
for twinning. These included metric symmetry higher than Laue symmetry,
similar R<SUB>int</SUB> values for higher and lower Laue groups, values of
|E<SUP>2</SUP>-1| &lt;&lt; 0.736 and unusually long cell axes.
