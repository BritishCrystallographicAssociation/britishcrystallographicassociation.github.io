<h1>Eastern Region Crystal Growing Competition</h1>

<P>
The winners in the Eastern Region Crystal Growing Competition were presented
with their prizes in a ceremony held at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre on 18 March by Dr Max Perutz. Nearly 140 schools took part in the
competition, in which the entrants had five weeks to grow a large, high
quality crystal of potash alum (aluminium potassium sulphate dodecahydrate).
 The contest was open to all schools in
the Eastern Counties (Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire,
Norfolk and Suffolk) in three age groups (under 11, under 14 and Open); the
chemical and hints on crystal growing were provided by the organizers. The
best crystals entered were on display in Cambridge University's SET98 Week
event held in the Department of Chemistry in Lensfield Road on 14 March
1998.

<P>
The crystals were judged on five quality criteria (presence of occlusions, correct morphology, edges, faces and clarity) as well as on mass.
