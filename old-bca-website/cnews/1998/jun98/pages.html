<BR><strong>From the President</strong><BR>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
       Those of you who attended the recent BCA Spring Meeting held in St
Andrews will, I am sure, wish to congratulate the organisers for holding
such a memorable conference. There were many highlights, including, in my
opinion, four excellent presentations from each of the groups given in a
single Plenary Session. Phil Lightfoot even managed to arrange for the right
sort of Scottish weather that ensured full attendance at all the sessions!

<P>
     Now it is important to realize that <strong>next year there will be no 
Spring Meeting,</strong> because instead we shall be putting our efforts into 
the IUCr
Meeting in Glasgow. It is most important that we show UK crystallography at
its best, and I would urge all BCA members to consider how they can
contribute to this meeting next year. In particular, Judith Howard would
like to hear as soon as possible of any suggestions for the programme, so
please contact her with ideas for plenary speakers and microsymposium topics
and conveners.

<P>
    It is with great pleasure that I congratulate our second oldest member, 
Arnold Beevers, on his 90th birthday, and George Bacon on his 80th!

<P>
  
The Annual General Meeting of the BCA, held at St. Andrews, voted in favour
of a proposal to increase the annual subscription fee for BCA membership. 
(The Minutes of the AGM follow on page 6)<BR>

<P>
From January 1st 1999, membership fees will rise as follows:
<ul>
  <li>ordinary member  - &pound;15 (from &pound;12)
  <li>student / retired / unemployed - &pound;7.50 (from &pound;6)
  <li>payment by credit card - as above
  <li>payment by standing order (ordinary member) - &pound;12 (from &pound;10)
  <li>payment by standing order (student / retired / unemployed) - &pound;6 
(from &pound;5)
  <li>5-year term payment - &pound;60 (from &pound;50)
</ul>
<P>
The decision to raise the fee, for the first time in 5 years, has been taken
for a number of reasons.  Many of the BCA's activities, including those from
the individual groups, are self-financing or are used to specifically
finance other activities - the purpose of the membership subscription has
always been to finance the administration of the Association and the
Newsletter. While the slice of this amount required to subsidise
"Crystallography News" has decreased as advertising revenue has increased,
there are now other demands upon that amount. 

<P>
Our annual payment of &pound;2,200 to the Royal Society for IUCr
subscription is a case in point, and we are now members of the European
Crystallographic Association, which also requires an annual subscription
fee. Furthermore, a decision was made by Council not to specifically
increase the amount paid by credit card subscriptions to allow for the
commission which is payable on each transaction. Thus administrative costs
have risen in real terms.

<P>
We therefore hope that the membership will bear with us, as we maintain and
improve the services we provide to members. This extra subscription revenue,
for example, is enabling us to provide members with a credit card payment
facility and automatic membership of the European Crystallographic
Association. 

<P>
Those members who currently pay by Standing Order Mandate (SOM) will need to
replace their current mandate with a new one. You will find a form enclosed
as an insert with the June 98 issue. Please complete the relevant sections
(note there is one that the BCA Treasurer needs to complete - please leave
this blank) and return it as soon as possible to <BR>
Dr. Stephanie Harris at Worcester. This is also an ideal opportunity to
start paying by SOM for those who have not done so before. First payments
will be made on the first working day of 1999.

<P>
Many thanks in advance for your co-operation and forebearance.

<BIG><BR><strong>Minutes of the BCA Annual General Meeting 1998<BR></strong></BIG>
<HR>
<P>
<em>held on Tuesday 7 April in the Physics Building, University of St
Andrews at 5.00 p.m. with the President, Professor Michael Glazer, in the
Chair.</em>

<P>
1.	The <strong>agenda </strong>was approved.

<P>
2.	There were no <strong>apologies for absence</strong>.

<P>
3.	The <strong>minutes </strong>of the previous AGM (held at Leeds on 16
April 1997) had been published in the June 1997 issue of <em>Crystallography
News </em>and posted during the conference. They were approved and signed by
the President. There were no <strong>matters arising </strong>from them.

<P>
4.	The <strong>Secretary's Report to Council</strong>, which had been
published in the March 1998 issue of <em>Crystallography News </em>as well
as having been posted during the conference, was accepted.

<P>
5.	Two proposed changes to the By-Laws of the British Crystallographic
Association were discussed.

<P>
By-Law D4 (<strong>General Meetings</strong>) was amended to read 'The
examined accounts shall be made available to Members at least two days
before the date of the Annual General Meeting, preferably with the agenda
paper'.  Normally this would mean that they should be displayed at the
beginning of the Spring Meeting.

<P>
Council had proposed that By-Law E2 (Nominations and Elections) should be
amended to read that nominations must be received by the Secretary not less
than <strong>seven days</strong> before the Annual General Meeting. This
proposal was defeated and the time will remain at <strong>two days</strong>.

<P>
It was agreed in principle that the standard term of office for elected
Members of Council should be three years and that the Immediate Past
President should be a Member of Council <em>ex officio </em>for one year.
Proposed changes to the Statutes and By-Laws would be brought to the next
AGM. This change would not affect the position of Group Representatives  or
<em>ex officio</em> members.

<P>
6.	Copies of the <strong>Treasurer's Report </strong>were given to all
members present. Dr Steve Maginn drew attention to the fact that overall the
BCA has made a small operating surplus of &pound;866, as opposed to a small
loss in 1996. For the first time the turnover of the BCA has exceeded
&pound;100,000. This is attributable to the 1997 Durham Teaching School,
which had a turnover in excess of &pound;20,000. The separation of
'Crystallography Congress 1999' funds took place in January 1997.

<P>
7.	<strong>Presentation of Accounts</strong>.	The amount spent on bursaries
during the year was &pound;4630, matching the profit of &pound;5408 made by
the Leeds Spring Meeting.  The Leeds University Conference Office and the
local organiser, Dr Mark Thornton-Pett, were thanked for the quick and
efficient production of accounts.

<P>
	The income from newsletter advertising has increased sharply due to both an
increase in advertising rates, and in the number of advertisers. All credit
to Kate Crennell for the fact that the Newsletter is now regularly breaking
even.

<P>
	Membership subscriptions have fallen. This is partly because of the change
in status and payment of the CCG and PCG, and partly because more members
are paying by standing order, which costs them less. Credit card payments
also incur a small penalty. 

<P>
	The accounts include a payment of &pound;2200 to the Royal Society to
reimburse them for part of the subscription to the International Union.

<P>
Mr R Husband, who has been the examining accountant, is retiring from
practice. Mr R A Young of The Young Company, Huntingdon was appointed as
Examining Accountant in his place. The accounts were accepted <em>nem
con</em>. Council recommended the raising of subscription fees to &pound;15,
&pound;12 and &pound;6 respectively for full membership, payment by standing
order, and reduced fee membership and an increase to &pound;60 for term
payments. This was approved with one vote against.

<P>
8.	<strong>Election of Officers and Ordinary Members of Council</strong>
<P>
<em>For President</em> - Professor Michael Glazer had been proposed by Dr
Steve Maginn and seconded by Dr Hilary Muirhead. As his was the only
nomination, he was declared duly elected.

<P>
<em>For Treasurer</em> - Dr Steve Maginn had been proposed by Dr Leo Brady
and seconded by Dr Sandy Blake. As his was the only nomination, he was
declared duly elected.

<P>
<em>For Ordinary Member of Council</em> - One nomination had been received
to fill one vacancy. Professor Guy Orpen had been proposed by Professor
Michael Hursthouse and seconded by Dr Frank Allen. As his was the only
nomination, he was declared duly elected.

<P>
Dr Chris Gilmore and Professor Judith Howard have been co-opted as Members
of Council.

<P>
9.	The <strong>Examining Accountant </strong>had already been appointed
under item 7.

<P>
10.	Under <strong>Any Other Business </strong>the matter of named lectures
was raised. The president said that the Lonsdale Lecture had been given last
year and that the next one would probably be in the year 2000. There would
be a Bragg Lecture next year but this was not organised by the BCA.

Moreton Moore correctly identified the mineral as the <em>swallowtail twin 
</em>form of gyspum, He writes: 'It is used in cements, building materials 
and plaster of Paris; it is found all over the UK, especially in 
Northumberland, and in the USA, Canada and France.'

<h2>News of Kathleen Lonsdale</h2>
<HR>
<P>
Thanks to Alan Mackay for sending this cutting from '<em>The Guardian</em>'
 of March 11th 1998:
<P>
  I was intrigued by the statistic in Peter Gorman's letter (March 7) that 
in 1996-7 "while 11% of people in England and Wales are Roman Catholic, 
17% of those in prison are".
<P>
  My mother, Kathleen Lonsdale, spent a month in Holloway prison in 1943. 
She was a Quaker and had refused to pay a fine for not registering for 
firewatching. On arrival a friendly inmate whispered that it was best to 
register as a Roman Catholic. They were issued with bibles with red covers, 
which, if wetted, could produce a passable substitute for lipstick. 
Protestants were given blue-covered bibles.
<P>
  My mother used this anecdote to illustrate the pitfalls of interpreting 
statistics.

<h1>The Amazing Dorothy Hodgkin</h1>

A leaflet about Dorothy Hodgkin was enclosed with this June 98 newsletter,
it has been provided by the <strong>Oxford International Women's Collective 
</strong> to publicise their Appeal for funds to erect some form of memorial
to Dorothy in Oxford where she did much of her research work. I asked BCA
members at St.Andrews what sort of memorial they thought Dorothy would have
liked. They all thought she would not have wanted a sculpture of herself,
preferring the money to be spent to help others. I have been asked to join
the committee deciding on the memorial, so I will try to keep you informed
of our progress.

<h1>New  Web Pages on BCA site for '<em>in-situ</em>' diffraction </h1>
<HR>
<P>
   In most diffraction experiments the sample is prepared well before the
experiment and brought to the diffractometer. However, there are many
circumstances in structural chemistry, physics, engineering, biology and
earth sciences where such a procedure may not be possible. The sample may
only be formed in a reactive environment and the preparation or
transformation is best carried out on the instrument itself. The scope for
such <em>'in-situ'</em> diffraction experiments has increased enormously over
recent years as more intense sources of X-rays and neutrons have enabled
experiments to be carried out on smaller samples or faster transformations,
or in environments that provide poorer access to the  probe.

<P>
    Many of these are industrially important as we heard from the
'Industrial Group' plenary session speaker at the St.Andrews meeting,
Patrick Fairclough, who is studying polymer crystallisation. Another classic
example of this kind of work is that of Pannetier and his colleagues on the
chemical and structural changes that occur deep inside a solid-state battery
as it discharges and the cell reaction proceeds. Neutron diffraction
provides a direct probe of these processes in real time in the chemical
environment most relevant to the problem.

<P>
  A wide range of problems is currently being studied in this way; they are
mainly in solid-state chemistry and materials processing at the moment, but
the idea is extending into the biological and earth sciences. As an emerging
field, the topic needs to bring together those who have the technical
expertise to perform the diffraction experiments, and those who have a
problem to solve in this area of structural science.

<P>
   Therefore, it has been proposed that a Web Page be set up on the BCA Web
site to  provide an information source on techniques and facilities, areas
of activity and practitioners, for experts and would-be users.  Andrew
Harrison and Kate Crennell are setting up a draft page at URL:
 <P ALIGN=CENTER>
   <strong> <a href="http://gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/insitu/Index.html">
http://gordon.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/BCA/insitu/Index.html</a></strong>
<P align =left>
We hope it will be there ready for your inspection by the time this newsletter is published. (Sorry, not there yet, we're working on it KMC,and AH)
<P>
     The page will focus initially on activities in the UK, concentrating on
neutron diffraction and X-ray techniques, with links to the more specialised
information held at the CLRC Laboratories by the ISIS Facility and the SRS
Daresbury; we plan further pages on activities in selected subject areas -
solid-state chemistry for example - with links to those doing such work.
Please look at the pages we have already - particularly the ones which are
merely outline contributions, they aim to give an introduction providing a
framework to link to more detailed contributions from active workers in the
field. 
 
<P>
     Let us know what other subjects you would like to see covered. In
future we hope to extend the scope of the activities and practitioners
beyond the UK and may also consider other structural probes such as EXAFS.
