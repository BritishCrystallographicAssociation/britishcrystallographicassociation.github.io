<h1>DL is helping  Cadburys to improve chocolate</h1>
<HR>
<P align=left>
A short report on page 8 of<em> 'The Times' </em>for 7 May 1998,  '<em>Best
chocolate bar none'</em>, describes the use of the SRS to determine the
differing phases of crystallisation of cocoa butter. This project is funded
by Cadburys and is a collaboration between DL and Heriot Watt University. 
It seems that phase V crystals give the smoothest chocolate, so the team are
now trying to create factory conditions that allow this phase to predominate
over the less tasty forms. There is a longer report on page 8 of the 
'<em>New Scientist'</em> of 9 May 1998.  Further details are in the Daresbury
SRS Annual Report Science Highlights

<h1>Meeting Report - 'Intercalation Compounds. Structure and Dynamics'</h1>

<P>
This one day workshop was held on 2 December 1997 at the Cosener's House,
Abingdon. It was organised by Winnie Kagunya and Chick Wilson (ISIS
Facility); supported by the Neutron Scattering Group of the Institute of
Physics and the Faraday Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry it
attracted participants from all over Europe and further afield.

<P>
Delegates were welcomed by <strong>Andrew Taylor</strong> (ISIS Facility)
who said how pleased he was to see the varied applications of neutrons in
scientific research as demonstrated by the range of papers submitted for the
meeting on topics which only 20 years ago would have been unthinkable. He
stressed in his welcome current plans for a European Spallation Source,
details of which can be found on the Internet at
<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/ess">http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/ess</a>
or obtained by mailing ess@risoe.dk. 

<P> <strong>John White</strong> (Australian National University) gave the
plenary lecture introducing the subject and summarising recent research on
graphite, silicates and molecular sieve compounds. He discussed recent
experiments on the materials and the application of neutron scattering and
other techniques in the elucidation of the physicochemical properties. In
his talk, the complementarity between neutrons and X-rays and how molecular
dynamics simulations have been used to explain the experimental results,
were discussed.  

<P> <strong>Deborah Jones</strong> (University of Montpellier) described
recent work of her research group on synthesis approaches aimed at
generating 2-D organic-inorganic hybrids with electrochemical and dye
properties. She described suitable hosts for the new synthesis procedures
and the role of a range of post-intercalation treatments on defining a
host-guest hybrid's architecture. Examples were drawn from layered inorganic
solids including metal (IV) hydrogen phosphates. 

<P> <strong>Neal Skipper</strong> (University College London) discussed how
neutron diffraction (complemented by computer modelling) has been used to
establish the structure and swelling properties of clay layers in an aqueous
media. In his talk he showed images derived from work that has been
conducted using the LAD diffractometer at ISIS Facility depicting clay-water
interfaces with orders of molecular layers of solvents. 

<P> The application of both X-ray and neutron diffraction in studies of
layered magnetic ordering of metal sulfide host lattices differently. 

<P>
<strong>Jose Dianoux</strong> (ILL) spoke on dynamics of water in charged
hosts (Nafion membrane and clays) using quasielastic neutron scattering. He
introduced the talk by reviewing the concept of neutron scattering and the
procedures for the analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering data. Results
showing evidence of short-range and long-range motions of the water
contained in clays and proposals of suitable geometrical models for the
dynamics were discussed.

<P>
The application of neutron scattering methods in studies of dynamics of
molecules in zeolites was further reviewed by <strong>Keith Ross </strong>
(University of Salford). Inferences from measurements of the long-range
diffusion of molecules in zeolite P and zeolite Y were discussed in the
context of microbalance measurements.

<P>
<strong>Mike Henderson</strong> (University of Manchester) presented a talk
on <em>in situ</em> synchrotron studies of hydrated calcium silicates. His
research group has been involved in studies of isothermal synthesis using
amorphous starting materials and the thermal decomposition of precursor
materials. He underscored the relevance of the work in cement-rock reactions
occurring in concrete-encapsulated toxic and nuclear waste sites.

<P>
Studies of complex molecules encapsulated in zeolite Y and their
significance as catalyst centres and enzyme mimics was the subject of the
talk presented by <strong>Phillip Mitchell</strong> (Reading University). 
He described the structural attributes of the encapsulated molecules from
vibrational measurements using inelastic neutron scattering and infrared
spectroscopy. These are in agreement with molecular mechanical calculations.

<P>
The talk by <strong>Colin Carlile</strong> (ISIS Facility) discussed the
opportunities available for research in intercalation science on the Osiris
spectrometer at ISIS Facility. The first commissioning results confirm that
the intensity on this spectrometer is significantly higher because of it's
supermirror guide. Along with the availability of long wavelength neutrons,
the instrument offers unparalleled opportunities for studies of guest-host
structures.

<P>
The closing talk was given by <strong>John Dore</strong> (University of Kent
at Canterbury) on the phase behaviour of water in MCM-mesoscopic materials.
Studies on sol-gel silicas using neutron diffraction have provided new
insights on the phase transition of water in confined pores. The findings
corroborate the theory on nucleation behaviour of water and opens up a large
array of ideas on studies of liquid water in an extreme state of
super-cooling.

<P>
The meeting was enjoyed by all. The participation of chemists, physicists
and even earth scientists emphasised the amount of interest that research on
guest-host systems enjoys.
