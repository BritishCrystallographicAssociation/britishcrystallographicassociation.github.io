<h1> 50 Years of Neutron Scattering</h1>

<P>
The meeting "50 years of Neutron Scattering" was held at The Cosener's
House, Abingdon on Thursday 23rd April 1998, together with a dinner to mark
the <strong>80th birthday of George Bacon</strong>.
The meeting was organised from the
Department of Physics, University of Sheffield where George was Professor of
Physics for 18 years and also acted as Dean of the Faculty of Pure Science.
It was sponsored by the British Crystallographic Association, the Neutron
Scattering Group of the Institute of Physics and of the Royal Society of
Chemistry and was supported by CLRC ISIS Facility, I.L.L. Grenoble and the
Oxford University Press, who mounted an exhibition of books.

George built the first neutron diffractometer in the U.K. at the Atomic
Energy Research Establishment (A.E.R.E.) Harwell (where he worked for 17
years) and used it in the first neutron diffraction experiments to be
performed outside the United States. He publicised the use of neutron
scattering through his papers, his review articles and above all his
textbooks. His classic "<em>Neutron Diffraction</em>" (Oxford University
Press) ran into three editions and was essential introductory reading for
many of today's leading neutron scatterers. It can be argued that without
George's pioneering work, the strong U.K. neutron scattering community would
not exist in its present form today.

The meeting which attracted 75 participants, was opened by its principal
organiser <strong>Neil Cowlam</strong> (Sheffield), who had made efforts to
 trace former colleagues of George from both A.E.R.E., and his former Ph D
students from Sheffield. He explained that the meeting was intended to be a
mixture of both retrospective and modern contributions on neutron science
and that he hoped it would give old friends the opportunity to get together
again. <BR>

<strong>Mick Lomer</strong> (Harwell, ILL) looked back at the early days at
Harwell and coincidentally confirmed the widely held belief that the
policeman on the gate was more likely to know what was really going than
your group leader! Looking back he marvelled at the speed with which
equipment was built in those days; in October 1945 Cockcroft was asked to
find a site for A.E.R.E. by August 1947 the first reactor, GLEEP, was
operating in Harwell.  <strong>Andrew Taylor</strong> (ISIS Facility) gave a
characteristically enthusiastic presentation in which he took the audience
forward beyond the year 2000 to a future European Spallation Source with a
neutron flux which would have been unthinkable at Harwell in the 1950's. Two
very modern contributions with a laptop PC and multimedia projector
followed. <strong>Bill David</strong> (ISIS Facility) took the theme of "50
years of neutron scattering" literally. He showed how the rise in data
collection rates closely imitated Moore's Law for the increase in computing
power. Examples of the analysis of neutron data were given from Bill's award
winning work on C<SUB>60</SUB>. <BR>

After the tea interval, <strong>Don Kearley</strong> (ILL) drove the PC for
his colleague <strong>Mark Johnson's</strong> presentation "Neutron and
numerical methods" which took examples from the materials studied by the
informal Numerical Methods Group at the ILL. They showed how a combination
of neutron diffraction, neutron spectroscopy and numerical modelling leads
to a deeper insight into the structures and dynamics of materials and
illustrated this with  fascinating film sequences of moving and vibrating
atoms. The presentation concluded with an example of the study of hydrogen
bonding, which had incidentally been one of George Bacon's interests since
the very start of his neutron work. The scientific meeting closed with a
contribution "Liquid semiconductors, then and now" by <strong>John
Enderby</strong> (Bristol) who reminded the audience that the most fruitful
progress is often made when neutron data are combined with the results from
bulk (in this case electrical) measurements. A group photograph was taken,
merging imperceptibly into the sherry reception and the dinner.<br>

<strong>Alan Leadbetter</strong> (ILL) acted as Master of Ceremonies and
drew attention to the 20 or so absent colleagues who had sent letters of
congratulation and support. In an interesting and informative speech
<strong>Bill Mitchell</strong> (Oxford, SERC) looked back over George's
career. He highlighted his training in optics and in mineralogy as an
undergraduate and drew attention to the galaxy of talent in crystallography
which was present at Cambridge during George's time as a graduate student.
He reminded the audience that George had always considered himself as much a
crystallographer as a neutron scientist. Bill also explained how George's
application to the SERC for financial support for personal access to neutron
facilities, had directly stimulated the birth of the Neutron Beam Committee
and the system of user access which continues to the present day. Finally
George himself looked back at his early days at Harwell, comparing the
pioneering scientific spirit of those times and the urgency to get things
done, with the wider view that the Harwell site was the responsibility of
the whole community working there. The extensive tree planting programme at
Harwell, whose wonderful legacy we see today, was possibly one of the first
expressions of environmental concern before the concept became quite so
fashionable.

The dinner closed with a presentation of a bouquet of flowers to Jean Bacon
for her mother, who was unable to be present through illness and a mounted
photograph of George signed by all of those present.
