<h1>New  Web Pages on BCA site for '<em>in-situ</em>' diffraction </h1>
<HR>
<P>
   In most diffraction experiments the sample is prepared well before the
experiment and brought to the diffractometer. However, there are many
circumstances in structural chemistry, physics, engineering, biology and
earth sciences where such a procedure may not be possible. The sample may
only be formed in a reactive environment and the preparation or
transformation is best carried out on the instrument itself. The scope for
such <em>'in-situ'</em> diffraction experiments has increased enormously over
recent years as more intense sources of X-rays and neutrons have enabled
experiments to be carried out on smaller samples or faster transformations,
or in environments that provide poorer access to the  probe.

<P>
    Many of these are industrially important as we heard from the
'Industrial Group' plenary session speaker at the St.Andrews meeting,
Patrick Fairclough, who is studying polymer crystallisation. Another classic
example of this kind of work is that of Pannetier and his colleagues on the
chemical and structural changes that occur deep inside a solid-state battery
as it discharges and the cell reaction proceeds. Neutron diffraction
provides a direct probe of these processes in real time in the chemical
environment most relevant to the problem.

<P>
  A wide range of problems is currently being studied in this way; they are
mainly in solid-state chemistry and materials processing at the moment, but
the idea is extending into the biological and earth sciences. As an emerging
field, the topic needs to bring together those who have the technical
expertise to perform the diffraction experiments, and those who have a
problem to solve in this area of structural science.

<P>
   Therefore, it has been proposed that a Web Page be set up on the BCA Web
site to  provide an information source on techniques and facilities, areas
of activity and practitioners, for experts and would-be users.  Andrew
Harrison and Kate Crennell are setting up a draft page at URL:

We hope it will be there ready for your inspection by the time this newsletter is published. (Sorry, not there yet, we're working on it KMC,and AH)
<P>
     The page will focus initially on activities in the UK, concentrating on
neutron diffraction and X-ray techniques, with links to the more specialised
information held at the CLRC Laboratories by the ISIS Facility and the SRS
Daresbury; we plan further pages on activities in selected subject areas -
solid-state chemistry for example - with links to those doing such work.
Please look at the pages we have already - particularly the ones which are
merely outline contributions, they aim to give an introduction providing a
framework to link to more detailed contributions from active workers in the
field. 
 
<P>
     Let us know what other subjects you would like to see covered. In
future we hope to extend the scope of the activities and practitioners
beyond the UK and may also consider other structural probes such as EXAFS.
