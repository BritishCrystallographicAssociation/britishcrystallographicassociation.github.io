<H2>A Darwin College Lecture, by Sir John Meurig Thomas, ScD, FRS, 
Master of Peterhouse,</h2>
<h3>given in Cambridge on Friday 30 January 1998</h3>

<P>
The Master of Darwin College introduced Sir John Meurig Thomas as one who
had spent his academic life in Wales, Cambridge and London; and who at
present was combining the r&ocirc;les of being Master of Peterhouse with
research at the Royal Institution (R.I.). As Sir John's lecture unfolded, it
was interesting to note how many eminent scientists from Peterhouse and from
the R.I. contributed to his story!

<P>
Sir John's lecture was given to a close-packed audience spanning several
generations, from young students to elderly and distinguished professors, in
the large lecture theatre opposite Newnham College; and it was illustrated
with numerous colourful slides and amusing anecdotes about the people
involved. His story started in 1912, with the young William Lawrence Bragg
walking along the Cambridge 'Backs', pondering over the diffraction of
X-rays which had just been discovered by Max von Laue and his team in
Munich. On 11 November 1912, he read his paper to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society which explained 'Laue spots' by the simple idea of
reflections from planes of atoms. This is how the subject of X-ray
crystallography began. And there were many Nobel prizes to be won on the
way, including one shared in 1915 between WLB and his father W.H.Bragg, who
was Professor at Leeds.

<P>
Other famous names mentioned included Linus Pauling (who, at the age of 21
had solved the structure of the mineral molybdenite by X-ray diffraction),
John Desmond Bernal (known to his friends as "The Sage"), the Norwegian
geochemist V.M. Goldschmidt who carefully listed ionic radii, and
W.T.Astbury of Leeds, the first Professor of Biophysics, who studied the
structures of fibres (such as silk and wool).

<P>
Sixty two years ago Max Perutz arrived at Peterhouse from Vienna, and was
given rhodonite to work on - "flakes from a lump of slag" - and he learnt
how to solve crystal structures too. John Kendrew (of Peterhouse) and
Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) also worked on minerals initially; and
J.D.Bernal (aged 23) solved the structure of graphite at the R.I. Sir John
showed a model of the graphite structure to the audience and, to indicate
its scale, said that a piece of graphite the size of one's fingernail, if
magnified by the same factor as the model, would stretch from Cambridge to
Vladivostok! 

<P>
It is extraordinary that the total number of minerals is a mere 3700, or so;
compared with more than ten million different chemical compounds. There are
even four million species of insects, of which 300,000 are beetles. This
fact prompted J B S Haldane to remark that he didn't know much about the
nature of God, except that He was "inordinately fond of beetles"!

<P>
The seventeenth-century Danish anatomist Steno (who later became a bishop)
measured the angles of quartz crystals and showed that the angles between 
corresponding faces of different specimens were always the same. The Swedes
Baron Kronsted and Berzelius classified minerals according to chemical
composition. Ideas on packing and symmetry were advanced by Kepler, Harriot,
Hooke, Huygens, Dalton, Federov, Schoenflies and Barlow: (the last named
having been an estate agent in Islington!). Dana's classification is the
definitive study of mineralogy. Another Petrean, Lord Kelvin, wrote in 1904
about the chirality of quartz: there were left and right handed varieties,
with slightly more specimens of left than right. There are left and right
handed versions of the 100 or so amino acids: the basis of life itself: and
Nature appears to use about 20, all of which are left handed. It is
conjectured that these amino acids might have been formed at the surface of
left-handed quartz; or, as Leslie Orgel (also of Peterhouse) showed by
experiment, on the surface of ice, of which there are eleven different
varieties. The molecule of the drug Aspirin crystallises in 29 different
forms, which prompted someone to remark that there were "twenty-nine
different ways of getting a headache"!

<P>
Even ten years after the Braggs had demonstrated the 6-6 octahedral
coordination of halite (NaCl), and the calcium ions in fluorite surrounded
by eight fluorine ions, some chemists were still unable to accept the ionic
structure of these compounds (as a letter to <em>Nature</em> by a Professor
Armstrong amply made clear). Earlier, Arrhenius's thesis had been rejected
by Uppsala University in which he had proposed that NaOH dissolved in water
formed ions. Michael Faraday (of the Royal Institution) had shown that ions
were present in molten substances; and the words he coined to describe them
can be seen (when using a magnifying glass) on the present-day £20 note.

<P>
Even though the Braggs determined the ionic distances in alkali halides,
they never became seriously interested in quantum mechanics. But Pauling did
make sense of ionic radii and was able to group them as a periodic table in
a remarkable study of alumino-silicates published (in <em>J. Amer. Chem.
Soc</em>) in 1935.
 
<P>
Recurring themes throughout Sir John's lecture were the relationships
between each individual crystal structure and the properties (chemical and
physical) of the substance. Questions such as "Can one play with
stoichiometry?" lead into ideas employed in modern materials science and
catalysis.
 
<P>
The polymorphism of calcium carbonate was illustrated by the growth of snail
shells of calcite/aragonite. Apparently, if a zoologist frightens a
particular snail whilst it is laying an egg, it will grow yet another
crystallographic form, namely vaterite! Starting with colourless corundum,
if a few chromium ions replace aluminium ions (about 1 in 5000) then a
beautiful ruby results. This should be green, but ruby is red. This apparent
anomaly of structural mimicry was explained in a one-page paper in
<em>Nature, vol 179 p 1348 June 29, 1957 'Ion compression and the colour of 
ruby'</em> by Leslie Orgel (Peterhouse).

<P>
Sir John then discussed various silicate structures based upon tetrahedra
arranged in chains and sheets. Egyptian blue was a substance used to
decorate the fine sculptured head of Queen Nefertiti, but the secret of its
composition had been lost in pre-Roman times. Humphry Davy (of the Royal
Institution) guessed that it was a flux of silicon dioxide with alabaster
and some malachite, a hunch later (1978) proved correct by the diffraction
pattern of a powder sample as small as a microgramme in weight.

<P>
Perovskites get their name from a Russian finance minister of the last
century and their structures form the basis of most modern high-temperature
superconductors. 25000 such structures have been determined in the past
decade!

<P>
Some open-structure silicates can allow small atoms, such as hydrogen and
helium, to pass through; and others can filter whole molecules (e.g.
methane) in industrially important processes such as in the manufacture of
petrol from oil. They have been given intriguing names, such as DAF-5 in
honour of Davy and Faraday (of the Royal Institution), and have strikingly
beautiful structures, some based upon truncated octahedra, which are
visualised by computer drawings and models. Most of the state of Nevada is
apparently made of mordenite, an example of an important catalyst in the
manufacture of petrol from natural gas. The economy of New Zealand depends
upon the use of such microporous inorganic catalysts. Zeolites are also used
in detergents and water softening; and some can act as solid acid catalysts
1000 times as strong as wet mineral acids.

<P>
Sir John left us in no doubt that structural mineralogy is an enormously
exciting subject with highly important economic applications worldwide. His
Royal Institution team is now making novel zeolitic solids by using
structure-directing template molecules. He concluded his brilliant lecture
with the example of ZSM-5, a porous catalyst synthesised in America in the
early 1970s but recently discovered naturally occuring by Italian
geochemists in Antarctica. It has a structure based upon rings of 10, 6, 5,
5,5 and 6 members. Amazingly, the same pattern is depicted on the walls of a
mosque built in Baku, Azerbaijan in 1086! He finally remarked, "There's
nothing new under the Sun!"
