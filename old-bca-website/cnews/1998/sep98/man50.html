This meeting was held June 16 to 17th 1998 in the Department of Chemistry,
University of Manchester in conjunction with celebrations in Manchester to
mark the <strong>50th Anniversary of the First stored-Program
Computer</strong>, which was built at the University of Manchester under the
leadership of the late Sir F.C. Williams. The first calculation, involving
3.5 million operations, was run successfully in June 1948 by Tom Kilburn,
now Emeritus Professor of Computer Science.  Ten Conferences took place in
the University through the week of June 15th to 21st 1998, which was termed
"Digital Week" by the City of Manchester. All ten Conferences shared the
central extravaganza event held in the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, which
was called "The Golden Anniversary". (A 'Golden CD-ROM has been produced as
a souvenir, details in the 'Editor' s Note at the end of this report)

<P>
For the Conference in the Chemistry Department a range of leading speakers
from the UK and abroad enthusiastically addressed the topic
'<strong><em>Computers in Structural Chemistry and Molecular
Biology</em></strong>' over the one and a half days of the conference. The
meeting was supported by the British Biophysical Society, the British
Crystallographic Association and the BBSRC Collaborative Computational
Project for Protein Crystallography (CCP4). The financial assistance of
Bruker, MSC and the IUCr, who each had advertising stands, was also
gratefully acknowledged. 

<P>
The 84 delegates from the UK, Europe and Australia were welcomed by
Professor John Helliwell in his opening remarks. He went on to make the
observation that recent years had seen the 100 year celebration of
R&ouml;ntgen's discovery of X-rays, 100 years of the electron and the Bragg
Centenary celebration (the latter held in the Manchester Physics Department
in 1990), and now it was the turn of the computer for its 50 year
celebration! <br>

Delegates at the Conference: speakers are seated on the front row, left to right:  <br>
<em>Alwyn Jones, Janet Thornton, Frank Allen, Durward Cruickshank, Syd Hall,
 Eleanor Dodson, John Helliwell, Tom Blundell, Tony Crowther, Michael
 Woolfson</em><br>
<p>
Emeritus Professor <strong>Durward Cruickshank</strong>, <em>UMIST</em>,
spoke on "<strong>The Manchester Ferranti Mark I computer: a marvellous
first tool for crystallographic calculations</strong>." Durward described
the famous 'Williams tube'; this was the computer memory, a Cathode Ray Tube
on which binary information was stored as 2560 spots or their absences.
Durward's team made regular excursions from Cox's Department in Leeds
starting in 1952 to undertake some of the earliest crystallographic
computations.  These included differential syntheses to study anisotropic
vibrations and calculations for Dorothy Hodgkin on wet vitamin B12. 
Anecdotes of how to keep teleprinters going through long nights of
calculations summoned up the correct pioneering images for the audience. 

<P>
Professor <strong>Syd Hall</strong>, from the <em>University of Western
Australia</em> spoke about "<strong>Coping with the structural chemistry
information explosion</strong>." Syd entered into the full spirit of the
event with computer lap top demonstrations of the power of the
crystallographic information file (CIF), which he had pioneered. CIF
provides a standard format for interchange of crystallographic data between
applications, between authors and journals, and allows automatic data
checking against standard dictionaries.  Clearly this will be ever more
vital to keep pace with rapid technical innovations in crystallography, the
latest being laboratory-based CCD area detectors. The development of the
'smart' dictionary, containing procedures as well as raw data, will make
manipulation of data explicit and customisable, and could reverse the trend
towards the 'black-box' use of programs. Syd was the British
Crystallographic Association Lecturer. 

<P>
Dr<strong> Frank Allen</strong>, <em>Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre</em>, discussed "<strong>Crystallographic databases, data mining 
and knowledge engineering in structural chemistry</strong>". <br> By
charting thousands of individual structures systematic trends can be
discerned, unexpected correlations are revealed or dynamic pathways can be
mapped. Database content can be converted into libraries of geometric
structures. A knowledge-based library of intermolecular interactions
(IsoStar) is now available and a library of conformational preferences is
under development.  Both libraries can drive software solutions in
structural chemistry and molecular design,  for example, predicting
protein-ligand docking modes, assisting in structure solution from powder
data, etc. 

<P>
Professor <strong>Janet Thornton</strong>, <em>University College
London</em>, spoke on "<strong>Computing and structural molecular biology:
the universe of protein folds.</strong>" The explosion of genome sequences
is upon us, and the 3-D structures are growing in number too: a total of
around 6000 protein 3-D X-ray structures exist in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB). Janet presented analyses of the relationships between protein
functions and protein folds. Using a CATHerine wheel format, the CATH
protein structural classification for each functional family could be 
easily generated, so that at a glance the coloured area fractions showed up
the distribution of folds for a particular function. The number of unique
folds is certainly expected to be limited, and could guide which new protein
structures to target first for 3-D structure determination. 

<P>
Professor Sir <strong>Tom Blundell</strong>, <em>University of
Cambridge,</em> closed the first day at the Chemistry Department with a
lecture on "<strong>Protein structure, genomics and the analysis of
function</strong>". Tom opened up with comments about his use of a third
generation Ferranti computer in Oxford. He then explored, via a wealth of
examples, how functional relationships between distant proteins could be
revealed, with computations leading to new experiments. Thus, AIDS
anti-virals followed from crystallographic studies on renin and the 
aspartic proteinases.  The human pentraxins were shown to have a family 
relationship with lectins. Other studies he discussed in detail were
insulin, and many others. The potential of these approaches in the context
of genomes would be very powerful, and software written within his group,
for example, for domain identification would allow targeting of new 
proteins with similar domains. In a genome, sequence analysis reveals that
a large percentage of the proteins are of unknown function. Many mysteries
clearly lie in store. 

<P>
<strong>Eleanor Dodson</strong> of the <em>University of York</em>, this
year's winner of the ACA Fankuchen award, spoke after the conference dinner
on "<strong>The past, present and future of protein crystallographic
computing</strong>". Eleanor described the early days in Dorothy's group 
and how communication by air mail was reserved for special stages of
calculations! She led on to recommendations for much more automated and
intelligent help tools for users of programme packages. <P>
 
<P>
Emeritus Professor <strong>Michael Woolfson</strong>, <em>University of
York</em> opened the second day's proceedings and spoke on "<strong>Direct
methods computations: from small molecules to biological
macromolecules</strong>." and took us through the various stages of
development of direct methods, and glimpses of the use of the Cambridge
EDSAC machine as well as the Manchester machine. He commented that this year
was also the 50th anniversary of the seminal publication by Harker and
Kasper of their inequality relationships in <em>Acta Crystallographica</em>
(whose 50 year anniversary it is as well!). From these inequalities modern
direct methods were born. Modern workstations now allow a million point
Fourier Transform in a couple of seconds, and opened up such direct methods
to calculations on proteins. The relative merits of anomalous scattering,
direct methods and combinations of these methods were explored in the
discussion. 

<P>
Professor <strong>Alwyn Jones</strong>, <em>Uppsala University, Sweden</em>
spoke on "<strong>The great strides made with molecular graphics.</strong>"
A career tour involving especially Munich and Uppsala, and other places on
the way, with machine specs in Vax units and costs in Ferrari units, showed
just how far computer price performance has improved. Beautifully
illustrated slides of his electron density maps showed the audience the wide
range of examples and cases met in Alwyn's many years' experience of this
area.  Alwyn was the BBSRC CCP4 Lecturer. 

<P>
Dr <strong>Tony Crowther</strong>, <em>MRC Cambridge</em> expanded the range
of the meeting yet further with a lecture on "<strong>Image reconstruction
and computational techniques: Getting the best from electron micrographs of
biological structures</strong>." Tony illustrated the power of computer
methods for analysing images of individual particles with hepatitis B virus,
the causative agent of a hugely important medical problem worldwide with 350
million carriers and 1 million deaths per annum. The structure of the 240
subunit core shell was determined by Bettina Boettcher to 7.4 &Aring; from
images of over 6000 individual particles, revealing the largely
alpha-helical protein fold. This map provided a basis for Andrew Leslie and
Samantha Wynne to solve the structure to 3.5 &Aring; by X-ray
crystallography. 

<P>
Professor <strong>Axel Brunger</strong>, <em>Yale University, USA</em> was
The British Biophysical Society Lecturer. Sadly, Axel's flight connections
were broken by bad storms on the eastern seaboard of the US, so he had to
send his apologies. His topic was to have been "Searching for the best
structure: combining computer simulation, X-ray diffraction, and NMR.". His
abstract had explained this was to be a full treatment of these
complementary and powerful techniques, no doubt to cover the capabilities of
his latest CNS program. 

<P>
Professor <strong>John Helliwell</strong> closed the meeting by offering his
own personal comments on the computer revolution picking up on the great
change in disk space capability, taking us into the 'terabyte era' of
structural computing.  This was hugely important, for example, for those
great structural data generators of today, synchrotron X-ray beamlines. <br>
He highlighted this with examples from his laboratory of ultra-high
resolution, time-resolved and MAD protein crystal structure studies. Indeed
he outlined the prospect of genome level numbers of protein 3-D crystal
structure determinations by anomalous scattering and direct methods in the
future.

<em>Editor's Notes:  </em><br>
 1.  The celebrations included a special exhibition in the Manchester Museum
and the manufacture of a replica of the 1st stored program computer, known
as 'The Baby', with a ceremonial running of the 1st  program. The replica
<strong> 'Baby</strong>' will be kept on display in Manchester, at the
Museum of Science and Technology.<br>

 2.  A CD-ROM  'The Computer that Changed the World'  has been produced as
an educational text for schools, a reference work for libraries and a
souvenir of the 50th Anniversary celebrations.  It has many pictures,
descriptions of early computers, especially those in Manchester between 1946
and 1974. Details of all the celebrations can be found on the Web at
<strong><a href="http://www.computer50.org">http://www.computer50.org</a>
</strong>, including the mechanism of the
Williams storage tube memory, and how to order the CD-ROM, which runs only
on high power PCs.  <P>

3. If you are interested in old computers you will be fascinated by the
Virtual Museum of Computing  ( at URL
<strong><a href="http://www.museums.reading.ac.uk/vmoc/">
http://www.museums.reading.ac.uk/vmoc/</a></strong> ) which is a completely
virtual collection of exhibits on the history of computers, etc.

<P>
4. If you prefer to see real old computers (gathering real dust not virtual
) you may like to visit Bletchley, where the Bletchley Park Trust is setting
up a Museum for Second World War memorabilia and technological exhibits such
as old wireless equipment and the Computer Conservation Society's collection
of old computers, including an Elliot 803 which it hopes to get running
again. They are replicating, <strong>Colossus</strong>, the first electronic
computer which ran a fixed program  Colossus was kept secret for over 30
years because it was used during the Second World War to help decode
wireless messages encrypted by the Enigma machine. All the workers conformed
so well to the Official Secrets Act that details of Colossus only came to
light  in about 1980 when they were released by the UK Government. 
Bletchley Park is easily reached by train since it is only a few hundred
yards from the railway station. Opening hours vary, most weekends during the

<h1>Types of data storage for early computers</h1>
<img  src="pt.gif" alt="paper tape"><br>

English computers used '5 hole' paper tape, The smaller 6th hole was a
timing track used to measure the speed of the tape through the reader.
Initially, the tapes were read mechanically with fingers poking through the
holes to make contacts. problems were that tape length was limited by the
mechanical strength of the paper between the small holes of the clock track,
which tended to tear when the tapes became longer and heavier. Later tape
readers were optical, and much faster. It took some time for computer
manufacturers to agree on a code standard so that paper tape made o one
computer could be read into another.

<p>
<img  src="oper.gif" alt="Operator"><br>

Some early computers could only read a program into memory if it was on a
single pieceof paper tape. The operator above is copying a program tape to a
new one and copying any utility routies it needs on the end of the new tape.
The master copies of the utility routines were kept in small filing cabinets
like the one on the left.

<img  src="card.gif" alt="Card"><br>

American computers tended to use punched card storage, again conducting
fingers poked through the holes to make a contact so that the circuit could
detect which holes had been punched. Cards were easier to edit than paper
tape, but had to be sequenced (in cols 72-80) if you were going to be able
to get them in the right order after accidentally dropping them.

<h1>DIRECT METHODS, 1998 AND ALL THAT!</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In June 1998 a series of meetings in Manchester commemorated the 50th
anniversary of the invention in that city of the stored-program computer.
One meeting, organized by John Helliwell, reviewed the impact of computers
in crystallography. As it turns out 1998 is the 50th anniversary of two
other important developments in crystallography - the <strong>birth of
<em>Acta Crystallographica </em></strong>and the <strong>origin of direct
methods.</strong>

<P>
The first paper on direct methods was by D. Harker &amp; J.S. Kasper
<em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1948, <strong>1,</strong> 70) which showed that for
very simple centrosymmetric structures inequality relationships could
unambiguously indicate the signs of some strong structure factors. An
important extension of this general principle, which applied to larger
structures, was that <em>probable </em>signs could be found from sign
relationships. This idea was presented in three papers which appeared
together. The first by D. Sayre <em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1952,
<strong>5</strong>, 60) introduced an exact equation between structure
factors for equal-atom structures, generally known as the <em>Sayre
equation. </em>The second by W. Cochran <em>(Acta Cryst. </em>1952,
<strong>5</strong>, 65) derived the sign relationship from a mathematical
expression of the physical condition that electron density is concentrated
around atomic centres. The third by W.H. Zachariasen <em>(Acta Cryst.,
</em>1952, <strong>5</strong>, 68) was theoretically unsound but introduced
the idea of representing unknown phases by symbols and showed how this could
be used to solve a simple previously-unknown structure.

<P>
More important progress was made in 1955 and 1956. The first computer
program, for the Cambridge machine (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic
Calculator), EDSAC, was written to apply sign relationships and it was shown
that the known structure salicylic acid could be solved in projection (W.
Cochran &amp; A.S. Douglas, <em>Proc. Ray. Sac., </em>1955,
<strong>A227</strong>, 486). Features of the program were the representation
of signs by symbols, the generation of a number of possible sets of signs
and the recognition of the correct set by a figure-of-merit test. In another
development Cochran introduced the three-phase relationship <em>(Acta
Cryst., </em>1955, <strong>8</strong>, 473) which extended the application
of direct methods to non-centrosymmetric structures. The probability density
of the sum of the phases of three large structure factors, with a null sum
of indices, was shown to be concentrated around zero (modulo 2<em>p</em> ).
Once a base of phase information was available a process of phase extension
was available since if two phases in a relationship were known then the
value of the third could be estimated. Finally, in 1956 J. Karle and H.
Hauptman <em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1956, <strong>9</strong>, 635) introduced
the tangent formula, a powerful tool for phase extension and refinement that
was to play a central role in much that followed.

<P>
Although all the ingredients were now in place for solving structures by
direct methods there was a lull of several years - with some progress but
none of it very critical. Then <br>
J<em>. </em>Karle &amp; I.L. Karle
<em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1963, <strong>16</strong>, 969) introduced the
<em>symbolic addition method, </em>a systematic approach to using symbols
which they later applied to the solution of a non-centrosymmetric structure
<em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1964, <strong>17</strong>, 835). This demonstration
that direct methods could be applied to non-centrosymmetric structures
opened the floodgates to new powerful developments. G.Germain &amp;
M.M.Woolfson wrote the first fully-automatic program, LSAM, based on
symbols, to solve centrosymmetric structures <em>(Acta Cryst. </em>1968,
<strong>B24</strong>, 91 ) in which the input was the basic observed data
and the output an image of the structure. In the same paper the concept of
MULTAN was described, an automatic multi-solution method for solving
non-centrosymmetric structures. This method was developed and described in a
series of papers over the next few years and by the late 1970's the widely
distributed, user-friendly MULT<em>AN </em>program was responsible for the
solution of almost two-thirds of reported structures. Many other automatic
program systems and new concepts were produced. SHELX (G.M. Sheldrick, 1975,
<em>SHELX. Program for Crystal Structure Determination. </em>University of
Cambridge) was similar to MULTAN but with some novel features. RANTAN (J-X
<em>Yao,Acta Cryst., </em>1981, <strong>A37</strong>, 642) initially
allocated completely random phases to all reflections to be phased so that
phase refinement occurred without phase extension. SIMPEL (H. Schenk &amp;
C.T. Kiers, 1984, in <em>Methods and Applications in Crystallographic
Computing. </em>Eds. S.R. Hall and T. Ashida,, Clarendon Press, Oxford) was
an automated symbolic addition procedure for non-centrosymmetric structures.
SAYTAN (T. Debaerdemaeker, C. Tate &amp; M.M. Woolfson, <em>Acta Cryst.,
</em>1985, <strong>A44</strong>, 353) replaced the tangent formula by a more
complicated phasing formula so giving phases that satisfied Sayre's
equation. XMY (T. Debaerdemaeker &amp; M.M. Woolfson, <em>Acta Cryst.,
</em>1989, <strong>A45</strong>, 349) used parameter-shift refinement to
optimize a target function based on Sayre's equation. In 1990 G.M. Sheldrick
<em>(Acta Cryst. </em><strong>A46</strong>, 467) and T.N. Bhat <em>(Acta
Cryst. </em><strong>A46</strong>, 735) introduced the idea of simulated
annealing to refine phases, borrowing ideas from liquid theorists who
numerically studied systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. With this armoury
of direct methods available it could be claimed by the end of the 1980's
that for smaller crystal structures, with up to 100 or so non-hydrogen atoms
in the asymmetric unit, the problem of structure solution was essentially
solved.

<P>
While these developments were happening in direct methods there was
spectacular progress in protein crystallography which was at the forefront
of the new biotechnology revolution. Those working in the direct methods
field began to set their sights on the solution of protein structures and
eventually M.M. Woolfson and J-X Yao <em>(Acta Cryst., </em>1990,
<strong>A46</strong>, 409) showed that a small known protein, Avian
Pancreatic Polypeptide (App) with 36 amino acids plus zinc and some ordered
water, was amenable to solution by SAYTAN. Sheldrick showed that this
structure could also be solved by his simulated annealing process. M.
Mukherjee and M.M. Woolfson ( <em>Acta Cryst., </em>1993,
<strong>D49,</strong> 9; <em>Acta Cryst.,<strong>
</strong></em><strong>D51</strong>, 626) demonstrated that MULT<em>AN
</em>could solve a larger protein, 2-Zn insulin, with over 800 non-hydrogen
atoms in the asymmetric unit, and that useful phases could also be found for
this structure with lower resolution data, down to about 2.25&Aring;.


<P>
A new contribution to protein solution, the SHAKE and BAKE method, was
introduced by the Buffalo group (C.M. Weeks, G.T. DeTitta, R. Miler &amp; H.
Hauptman, <em>Acta Cryst.,1993, </em><strong>D49</strong>, 1 79). This
involved phase refinement, either by the tangent formula or by parameter
shift optimization of a target function, alternating with real-space
filtering by selecting large peaks from a Fourier map. This has been shown
to be able to solve protein structures with several hundred atoms by
perfectly objective procedures.<br>
<br>
Most of the demonstrations of
structure solution for larger proteins have been for structures containing
heavy atoms. Recently M.Mukherjee and M.M. Woolfson <em>(Acta Cryst. </em>in
press) have shown that RNApl, a 96 amino-acid protein containing five
sulphur atoms, can be solved quite automatically from data to
finally-refined structure at 1.17&Aring; without any intervention. If this
process is generally applicable and not just a flash-in-the-pan, which is
still to be demonstrated, then it offers the prospect of doing for
small-to-moderate size proteins what has already been achieved for larger
non-protein structures.

<h1>Coping with the Information Explosion in Structural Science</h1>
<h2>a summary of Syd Hall's talk</h2>
<HR>

<P>
     There is considerable interest among structural scientists at the
moment in the future impact of area-detector diffractometers and fast
computers. These advances pose a number of concerns: will these devices
flood us with data and structures; how will labs archive all of this data,
and how will journals absorb the surge of new structures? This talk explored
the nature of the data crisis, and what role data languages, such as CIF,
would play in handling future data growth, and turning these into a benefit
rather than a burden. 
 
<P>
     Seeing into the future is never easy, but one prediction is obvious..
computers will continue to evolve and expand rapidly in performance. In the
next two years workstations with 100 gigabyte disks will be available, and
terabyte disks within the decade... gigabyte RAM memories will become
standard... and Internet links will operate at gigabyte bandwidths. Despite
such dramatic improvements in technical support, scientific data is unlikely
to grow rapidly. Depositions to databases, such as the CCDC and PDB
(currently at 1200 and 160 per month, respectively), will continue to
accelerate... but at a lesser rate. 

<P>
   The reason for this is also obvious. Although computer and instrument
capacities have improved a thousand-fold in the past decade, that of the
unaided human remains constant! The production of scientific knowledge is
critically dependent on human capacity.  We are all well aware of our own
limitations so it makes sense in these hectic times to ask computers to do
more smart tasks so that we can concentrate on more important stuff.
Universal data languages, such as CIF, are essential if we want computers to
do clever things. A fundamental  requirement is that data be presented in a
flexible, self- descriptive and computer-parsible way. Then data
dictionaries can be used to specify the relationships between data and
provide automatic methods for the  evaluation of data based on these
relationships.

    In crystallography existing CIF dictionaries already provide much of
this information for core, macromolecular and powder items and these are
actively used by journals for data validation. Considerable software is
available for manipulating CIF's and for developing local  applications. Syd
demonstrated how to access the CIFs at the Acta C web site and display
published structures on the screen using local software. A similar approach
works for viewing macromolecular structures from the PDB using, say,
RASMOL,( the PD protein viewing program available on many platforms,) called
from a web browser on a PC.

   Details of the CIF web link are at
http://www.crystal.uwa.edu.au/Crystal/Software/Ciffilter/ where you will see
the latest details what needs to be done to install it. 

<P>
  The data languages such as CIF, and their associated dictionaries, open up
all sorts of new and intelligent ways to handle data. The use of a tool like
<strong><em>cif2pdb </em></strong>to direct data to RASMOL is a
 simple but useful
example of the sorts of general applications that are possible with this
approach. 

<P>
  This sort of portability and versatility is essential for application to
more complicated data handling tasks. Languages such as CIF provide
opportunities for moving the knowledge of data relationships out of computer
programs into dictionaries, so that they can be used as electronic text
books, or as interactive algorithms for software applications. This
prediction will cause some programmers to grimace, as clearly such an
approach would be slow on today's computers, but interpretive processes are
likely to be widely used in the future. Just think of the algorithmic
transparency compared to the current software black boxes! <BR>
