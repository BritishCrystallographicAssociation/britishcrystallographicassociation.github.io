<BR><strong>From the President</strong><BR>
<HR>
<P>
      Although this time of year is normally considered to be the "silly
season", there is a serious issue to which I would like to draw your
attention. This is our subscription to the IUCr.  In the past this has been
paid on our behalf by the Royal Society directly to the IUCr to cover our
membership at Category 5 (meaning 5 delegates to the IUCr). The only other
country in this category is the U.S.A. However, the Royal Society now wishes
to change the arrangements by making the BCA the adhering body to the IUCr
and at the same time cut its contributions to less than 49% of Category 4
membership.  The BCA Council will soon have to grapple with this issue and
decide, for example, if we should drop to Category 4 or remain at Category
5.  It would be helpful therefore if you would e-mail me your views on this
so that Council can take them into account.

<P>
      You will all by now be aware that the Government has substantially
increased the science budget, and if this turns out to be a true increase,
it must be welcome to us all. Of course, we still have to see the exact
conditions attached, but given the multidisciplinary nature of
Crystallography it is likely that many of us should benefit from what
appears to be the first serious increase in funding in many years. At least
I hope this is the case.

<P>
      The arrangements for the Glasgow IUCr meeting are now proceeding
rapidly, with the major elements of the programme already determined. I
believe that the programme should have something for everyone and the IUCr
meeting promises to be one of the largest scientific meetings next year in
Europe. It is not too early to begin thinking about coming to Glasgow!

<a name="hons"><P></a>
      Recently the BCA Council decided to institute a new category of
membership, the Honorary Membership. I am pleased to say that Council has
now conferred this on Professor Bruce Forsyth, Professor Aaron Klug,
Professor Max Perutz  and Dr. Ron Jenkins.

<P>
     Finally, it is a pleasure to congratulate Keith Bowen on recently 
being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and Judith Howard on her 
Senior Fellowship Award of the EPSRC.</p>

<h2>HERBERT G&Ouml;BEL TO RECEIVE THE ].D. HANAWALT AWARD</h2>
<HR>

<P>
The International Centre for Diffraction Data takes pleasure in announcing
that <BR>Dr. Herbert G&ouml;bel, Siemens AG, ZT MF 7, Otto Hahn Ring 6,
M&uuml;nchen, Germany, has been selected to receive the J.D. Hanawalt Award
for excellence in the field of X-ray Powder Diffraction.<BR>

<P>
The J.D. Hanawalt Award is presented every three years for important, recent
contributions to the field of X-ray powder diffraction. The award consists
of a citation and a cash gift of $1,000.  Dr. G&ouml;bel will submit an
abstract and present a paper on the work being recognized at the 47th Annual
Denver X-ray Conference in Colorado Springs, CO, U.S.A. to be held August 3
- 7th 1998. The presentation of the award will take place at the same
conference.

<h2>News From '<em>Physics World</em>' August 1998</h2>

<P>
The editorial welcomes the Government's investment plans: &pound;400m in new
projects through the research councils, &pound;300m in Universities through
a new Infrastructure Fund and another &pound;300m for research in
Universities through the regional funding councils. The Wellcome Trust is
contributing &pound;300m to the Infrastructure Fund, and a further
&pound;100m towards the construction costs of a new third generation
synchrotron X-ray facility to be used mainly for bio-medical research.  The
question is whether physical scientists, who do three-quarters of the work
on the SRS will be forced off the new machine to make way for biologists
(see pages 3, 5 of 'Physics World'  August 1998).
<p>
  A decision on where the
new synchrotron is to be built has not yet been made.

<h3>Amusing(?) Web sites to try for Scientific Cartoons and Jokes</h3>

<BR>My daughter, a mechanical engineer, showed me a cartoon last week <BR>
which we both thought hilarious, partly because it ended with the punchline <BR>
shown in the fragment to the right.  She downloaded it from the Internet, <BR>
where new cartoons are added weekly to the URL  <BR>
                  http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/<BR>

Two atoms are walking down the street. One turns to the other  &amp; says "
<I>Oh no! I think I'm an ion</I>". The other responds "<I>Are you sure?</I>
". "<I>Yes, I'm positive</I>" is the reply.
<P>
If this sort of thing appeals to you, surf to the Science Jokes page, 
described in the New Scientist for 11 July 98 p 194.  It can be found at:
