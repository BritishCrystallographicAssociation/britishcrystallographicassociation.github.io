The Royal Society has added more information to its web site (address above)
including a directory of the names and addresses of current fellows.  Full
text of Royal Society reports and statements are published on the web site
as they are released, including their comments on the Research Assessment
Exercise. Paper copies of this document may be obtained by sending a stamped
addressed envelope to the Science Advice Section. You can now read the
text of the newsletters 'ICSU focus' and 'Royal Society News' on the Web. If
you cannot see where they are from the contents on the first page, there is
a useful search facility which can find them when you ask for the text
string 'ICSU'. One of the more recent ones is at 
http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/st_icsu4.htm  where you can read more about the
relations between the Royal Society and the International Unions referred to
by our BCA president, Mike Glazer, on page 2 of this newsletter.
<BR><strong>On-line applications encouraged. </strong>
As an experiment to facilitate
application processes, electronic forms may be downloaded direct to PCs for
Royal Society Research Grants, and Conference Grants

<strong>New Fellows elected in 1998  -   </strong>40 new Fellows were
elected this year, among them <strong>Keith Bowen</strong>, who has made
unique contributions in applied physics and instrumentation to nanoscience
and metrology.  Others you may know are, Dr. Hari Bhadeshia, Cambridge and 
Dr R.K.Thomas, Oxford.<strong><BR></strong>

<P>
<strong>Olga Kennard Fellowships </strong>The fellowships were established
in 1997 with the first appointment available from 1 October 1998. The scheme
is aimed at outstanding research scientists in crystallography or structural
molecular biology with more than three years postdoctoral experience.
Appointees are encouraged to spend up to two years of the fellowship working
at institutions outside of the UK within Europe. The first holder of this
prestigious fellowship will be <strong>Dr John Rafferty </strong>working on
the structural investigation of DNA recombination at the <strong>University
of Sheffield.</strong>

<strong>Fellow Honoured. </strong>Her Majesty the Queen has approved the

<strong>Biographical Memoir. </strong> Ken Holmes, Heidelberg is writing a
biographical memoir of Sir John Kendrew and would appreciate help from
readers who knew him.

<strong>New Frontiers in Science </strong>Exhibition was held on 17th and
18th June 1998. <BR> As usual it was a fascinating collection of exhibits
including:<BR> '<em>Christmas trees on the wing</em>'  a study of iridescent
butterflies and moths with possible<BR>   future military applications to
the hiding of 'stealth' bombers from enemy radar.<BR> '<em>Microscopic glass
fibre crystals: the world's longest holes</em>', this revolutionary type of
optical fibre can guide high power multicoloured laser light with
unprecedented precision over long distances. It was interesting, but I
thought it misnamed. The fibres are glassy, not crystalline, they are packed
together so that their cross section looks similar to close -packed spheres
so they were just called 'crystals'.<BR> '<strong>Ice - hot cold and
confused</strong>'. This exhibit was very popular with visitors. It's
serious purpose was to explain the recently discovered new phase of ice, but
it also tried to interest people in the extraordinary properties of  water
in a light hearted way. I am hoping to set up a new page on the BCA Website,
devoted to the structure of ice, with help from the exhibitors on this
stand.

The same issue has news of <strong>major changes in the National X-ray
Crystallography Service</strong>. A new diffractometer has been installed, a
Nonius Kappa CCD machine. <BR>The Service operation will move to the
Chemistry Department at the University of Southampton, where the Service
Director, <strong>Mike Hursthouse</strong>, takes up a post as Professor of
Structural Chemistry in September. Current registered users will be kept
informed of the timing of the move, others who may wish to use the Service

The EPSRC has been looking at the age distribution of Principal
Investigators to see whether there as any truth in the accusation that only
old, well established researchers can get grants, so young people become
discouraged and leave the field.

For proposals submitted after 1 September 1998, there are <strong>new
arrangements for feeding referee's comments</strong> back to proposers prior
to the proposals being considered by Prioritisation Panels for all EPSRC
Programmes and the majority of schemes.
