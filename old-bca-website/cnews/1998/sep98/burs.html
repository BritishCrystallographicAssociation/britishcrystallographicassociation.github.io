<h2>Bursary Report on the BCA Spring Meeting 1998</h2>

<P>
The BCA Spring Meeting 1998 at the University of St. Andrews was a useful
and well-attended conference that focussed on many important areas of
crystallographic research at the moment. Firstly, from a personal point of
view, I found the electronic means of abstract submission, by uploading a PC
document via the WWW to the BCA site, an excellent means of abstract
submission. This worked very smoothly as a trial run to the IUCr99 in
Glasgow.

<P> This years' conference saw the absence of the Bragg and Lonsdale
lectures and thus the lecture with the most historical perspective was the
opening plenary lecture, <em>38 Years<strong> </strong>Hard Labour as
<strong>a </strong>Fibre Diffractionist, </em>delivered by Struther Arnott.
This was an illuminating and entertaining account of the wealth of
information lying in the fibre diffraction patterns of polynucleotides. It
was also quite disconcerting for the crystallographer who possibly might be
losing a lot of information by persisting in working with sequences, which
are known to crystallise! Malcolm Walkinshaw's lecture, <em>Cyclophins as
Targets for<strong> </strong>Ligand Design, </em>contained examples of the
cyclophin family from various species which bind the immunosuppresant
cyclosporin A. Samantha A. Wynne, from the LMB Cambridge, gave an account of
the structure of the hepatitis B capsid protein solved from data collected
to 3.6&Aring; at the ESRF. This lecture was part of the BSG <strong><em>Hot
Structures </em></strong>session; the capsid, which surrounds the DNA virus
core, had spectacular icosahedral symmetry as well as 5-fold, 2-fold and
3-fold symmetry. Samar Hasnain discussed the structure of Superoxide
Dismutase and the mechanism of its reduction. Two crystal forms of the
native compound were produced and data collected to 2.3 and 1.6&Aring; at
Daresbury stations 9.5 and 9.6 respectively. These were solved and refined
in the space groups C222<SUB>1</SUB> andof potential non -linear optically
active compounds. This lecture contained results obtained from
single-crystal neutron diffraction at the ILL and ISIS and charge density
analysis derived from X-N data. However, I believe it was too soon for the
CCG to devote a full session to this subject after the 1996 Cambridge
meeting. The Twinning workshop had a good general introduction to the
problem of twinning and its treatment in refinement. As a SMART user, I am
familiar with the XPREP package although most of the participants were not.
I believe it would have been a good idea to include other manufacturer's
software here as well. In the commercial exhibition, I was interested in the
MSC method for the production of Xe derivatives for collecting
Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) macromolecular data.

<P> Many of the posters presented contained excellent work: Madeline
Helliwell's poster, in particular, interested me. This illustrated the
enormous and growing importance of Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion in
chemical crystallography. The compound under investigation was a molecular
sieve with the formula
Na<SUB>6</SUB>[Co<SUB>x</SUB>Zn<SUB>x</SUB>PO<SUB>4</SUB>]<SUB>6</SUB> The
data had been collected from a single crystal using MoK<em>a</em> radiation
but the lack of scattering contrast between the cobalt and zinc atoms had
not allowed their positions and hence ratios to be determined. The MAD data
collected at the ELETTRA close to the K absorption edges of Co and Zn
allowed f' Fourier maps to be calculated, the Co and Zn atoms to be
pinpointed and their ratios determined at
Na<SUB>6</SUB>[Co<SUB>0.2</SUB>Zn<SUB>0.8</SUB>PO<SUB>4</SUB>]<SUB>6.</SUB>

<P> I presented one poster in the CCG session jointly with Elena S.
Alekseyeva entitled <em>The Effect of Boranes on <strong>the
</strong>Carbonyl Group and Hydrogen-Bonding in Carborane
Derivatives<strong> </strong></em>and one in the BSG poster session,
<em>Ultra Low-Temperature Crystallographic Studies on CEW-Lysozyme, Using
the Fddd Cryo-Diffractometer at Durham<strong>. </strong></em>I had a lot of
interesting discussions about this with mainly protein crystallographers who
were interesting in the possibilities of getting improved data sets at low
temperature. These discussions were well appreciated and for this and the
opportunity to attend this lively meeting I thank the BCA for my bursary.

 <H2>Bursary Report on the ERICE School 1998</h2>
<HR>

<P>
 The ERICE school programme was constructed such that an underlying theme
pervaded each session. A more introductory lecture was often included at the
start of a session in order to brief the more unfamiliar subjects to its
participants. Several class discussions, following one of these themes, took
place after the relevant session. These allowed us to discuss the overall
theme in a more general and informal manner. Moreover, hands-on computing
sessions also followed up specific lectures thereby helping to bring the
lecture material more to life and allowing the participants to learn new
software. 

<P>
 In particular, three general themes seemed to dominate the conference:
intermolecular interactions, polymorphism and experimental techniques. On
the first of these topics, I was especially enthused by Desiraju's overview
of the present state of the subject and Bernstein's talk on applying graph
set theory to the CSD. All of the polymorphism talks I found very
informative especially since I initially possessed very little knowledge in
this topic area. Lecturers on the third of these themes presented overviews
of commonly used technology and exciting new developments such as CCD area
detectors and liquid He cryostreams. My highlights of the meeting also came
from some of the more 'stand-alone' lectures, in particular, Buergi's talk
and computing session on thermal motion analysis, Brock's discussion on what
one can learn from space group frequencies in the CSD, Evan's lecture on
negative thermal expansion and Bruce's enlightening talk on <em>ab
initio</em> approaches to solve powder diffraction patterns. 

<P>
 My main contribution to the meeting was in the form of a poster
presentation which was presented in the first of the three hour sessions. I
chose to present work on the role of intermolecular interactions in
determining non-linear optical properties. This gave me the opportunity to
discuss my results and possible extensions to my present approaches with
many participants. 

<P>
 Last but by no means least, I think that one of the strong assets of the
school was that the majority of lecturers stayed throughout the duration of
the conference Therefore, one had the rare opportunity to have one-on-one
detailed discussions and form new collaborations with leaders in each field
of crystallography.
