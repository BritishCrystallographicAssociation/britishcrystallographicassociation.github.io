<h1>Blue Plaques for Physicists</h1>
 <p> A few years ago, the Director of the Institute of Physics, Brian
Davies, set up a scheme to erect blue memorial plaques in public places
commemmorating famous scientists. He was concerned that although there were
plenty of artists being honoured in this way, there were very few
scientists. The scheme continues as part of the Institute of Physics
contribution to the Public Understanding of Science. 
<p> Members of the
Institute are encouraged to make nominations of scientists from their part
of the country through the Institute's Branches. This is normally done in
collaboration with a local historical society for the area and the local
authorities who have to agree the planning permission. There may be other
formalities if the plaque is to be on a listed building or in a National
Park. BCA members who attended the Annual Conference in Leeds last year may
have seen the one commemorating Sir William Henry Bragg (see
'Crystallography News' No. 60 March 1997 <a href="../../1997/mar97/bragg.html">
'The Braggs in Leeds'</a> and page 63
for the text of the plaque). 
 
<P>
      The Spring 1998 newsletter of the History of Physics Group of the
Institute of Physics has more details and includes names of further
proposals, one is for Dame Kathleen Lonsdale FRS (1903 - 1971); I feel
sure members of the BCA will want to support her case.  You may also like to
propose other physical crystallographers from your area who deserve to be
commemorated; look at the list below and see which eminent physicists are
missing. If so, please contact the Director, Education & Public Affairs, <a
href="http://www.iop.org"> The Institute of Physics,</a>
 76 Portland Place, LONDON W1N 3DH with your proposals.
<p>
<h2>Criteria to be satisfied in erecting a plaque</h2>
Here are a few details of how to go about making a proposal:<br>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>The person to be honoured must be recognized as an outstanding
physicist (scientist, astronomer, etc) who has contributed to the
advancement of physics by his/her theories, discoveries or inventions.
 <li> The person to be honoured must have a direct connexion with the
proposed site of the plaque (birthplace,  school,   university/laboratory 
[where he/she taught,  carried out most of his/her work),   place of
residence,    a building already associated with physics, astronomy etc
housing artefacts with with he/she had a strong connexion).
  <li> There should not be any other commemorative plaque/tablet/inscription
to the person to be honoured in the same locality
</ul>
