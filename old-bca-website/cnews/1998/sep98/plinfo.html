<DT> <a name="jc">John </a>Canton, FRS (1718 - 1772)
<DD><em>Location:</em>	near the main door of the Old Town Hall in the 
Shambles, Stroud. This building used to house the school which he attended.
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>	22 May 1997 by Professor Ian Butterworth

<P> Canton was born and spent his formative years in Stroud,
Gloucestershire. Although he left school early in order to go into the
family business, Canton continued to study in his own time. A Dissenting
preacher from Stroud, Dr. Henry Miles, noticed his talent, and arranged for
him to leave home, and eventually to become articled to Samuel Watkins,
master of a school near to what is now Liverpool Street Station in London.
Having served his apprenticeship from 1738-1745, Canton succeeded Watkins
and kept the school until his death 27 years later. Henry Miles became FRS
in 1743, and through him, Canton was able to mix in natural philosophical
circles, and by the late 1740s, had acquired a reputation as an
experimentalist. He was made FRS in 1749, despite being involved in a
priority dispute over a novel method of making artificial magnets. His main
field, however, was electrostatics. He was the first person in England to
repeat the French experiments confirming Franklin's theories of lightning,
and whilst doing this, became drawn to the mystery of the polarity of the
charge on a cloud. He invented a portable electroscope to detect charge
present in a system, and it is for experiments on electrostatic induction
that Canton remains well-known. "Liberal in politics, latitudinarian in
religion, devoted to his profession, schoolmaster Canton was one of the most
distinguished of the group of self-made, self-educated men who were the best
representatives of English physics in the mid-eighteenth
century."<SUP>1</SUP>

<DT> <a name="jp">Joseph </a>Priestley, FRS (1733 - 1804)
<DD><em>Location:</em>	on the Warrington Salvation Army Citadel which 
stands on a site once occupied by a Warrington Academy Tutor's House 
where Priestley lived from 1762 - 1767

<DD>
<em>Unveiled:</em>	26 April 96 by Dr. J.A. Scott (Vice-President of the IOP)

<P>
Born and brought up in Yorkshire, Priestley was educated for the ministry,
and attended the Dissenting Academy at Daventry until 1755. After two
unsuccessful posts as preacher, he set up a school in Cheshire, where he
gained such a good reputation that he was invited to become a tutor at the
Dissenting Academy at Warrington. He took up this post in 1761, and taught
many things including languages, history, law and oratory, but not natural
philosophy! He became a prolific writer, with publications ranging from
<U>The Rudiments of English Grammar</U> to <U>Essay on the First Principles
of Government</U>, which was said to have influenced Jeremy Bentham. He also
began writing on scientific matters, though, and completed his <U>History of
Electricity</U> in 1767. Whilst researching this book, he had met up with
Benjamin Franklin and John Canton <a href="#jc">(see above)</a> in London, and had been
elected FRS at their suggestion. Priestley and his family (he had married in
1762) moved to Leeds in 1767, where he took up a Presbyterian ministry, and
also began his researches into the nature and properties of gases for which
he is now famous. In 1773, he entered the service of the Earl of Shelburne,
as librarian and advisor to the household tutor, and continued to study
gases under his patronage, in the family homes in Wiltshire and London. In
1780, he moved his family to Birmingham, where he took up another preaching
post, and became involved with the famous Lunar Society (which counted
amongst its members at that time Erasmus Darwin and James Watt). The society
supported his researches into gases, and his opposition to the new chemistry
of Lavoisier. 
<p>
In 1791, he spoke out in favour of the initial phases of the
French Revolution. This, together with his continued vocal opposition to
sectarian intolerance within England led to his property being burnt by a
"Church-and-King" mob, and his life being endangered. For a while he lived
in Hackney, teaching natural philosophy and preaching at the Dissenting
Academy there, but in 1794, he felt it necessary to emigrate to the United
States. When he arrived, he was well-received, and offered a position as
Professor of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. He turned this
down, however, in favour of settling in an area reserved for British people
fleeing persecution. This settlement never really took off, but the
Priestleys elected to remain there. Priestley became very unhappy after his
wife and one of his sons died in the mid-1790s, but his grief was tempered
slightly in his latter years when Thomas Jefferson was elected President in
1800. He had supported Jefferson's cause throughout, and Jefferson
personally befriended him, and at last he felt as if he were in a country
where the political authorities were not going to persecute him. He died in
1804, and was buried in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.

<DT> <a name="jd">John</a> Dalton (1766 - 1854)
<DD><em>Location:</em> Stramongate School in Kendal,  Cumbria
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em> March 1998
<p>
This plaque jointly commemmorates John Dalton and Sir Arthur Eddington, 
both of whom were associated with this school.  Dalton was a teacher at the
school from 1781 to 1793, the founder of atomic theory and the `father' of 
modern chemistry.

<DT> <a name="jcm">James </a>Clerk Maxwell, FRS (1831 - 1879)

<DD><em>Location:</em>	on the Strand Building of King's College, London

(Vice-President of the IOP) and Professor Cyril Domb (first Clerk Maxwell 
Professor of Physics at King's College, London, 1954 - 1981)

<P>
Maxwell was one of the most eminent theoretical physicists of the nineteenth
century. He was educated in Edinburgh, and entered the University at 16,
having had a paper published the previous year by the Royal Society of
Edinburgh on a method of drawing ellipses using pins and thread. After
becoming Second Wrangler at Trinity College, Cambridge, he obtained a chair
at Aberdeen, but moved down to the Strand in 1860 when he was made redundant
in an administrative reorganisation. His legacy to electromagnetism, the
Maxwell Equations, were put forward in 1864. He worked for five years at
King's College, on the British Association project to measure electrical
standards, but resigned and returned to Scotland on the death of his father
(his mother having died when he was still a child). He returned to Cambridge
in the early 1870s, to set up the Cavendish Laboratory from scratch, but
tragically died of cancer at the age of 48. He was succeeded in his post by
Lord Rayleigh.

<DD><em>Location:	</em>in the main entrance to the Turbinia Gallery of the
 Newcastle-upon-Tyne Museum of Discovery
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>	20 May 1997 by Sir Arnold Wolfendale 
(Immediate Past-President of the IOP)
<P>
Parsons, a physicist and engineer, was President of the Institute from
1923-25. His father was an astronomer and maker of outstanding telescopes,
and eventually became President of the Royal Society. After studying in
Dublin and Cambridge, Parsons undertook an apprenticeship in engineering,
and throughout his life, he continued to combine his knowledge of theory and
practice, in the tradition of Kelvin and Watt, to produce original work in
the fields of power generation and marine propulsion. He designed and
patented a multistage, high- pressure steam turbine for use in the firm
where he worked, and by the end of the nineteenth century, had set up his
own company to make turbo-generators, especially for use in marine power. He
displayed his 48 m craft, <em>Turbinia</em>, at the 1897 naval celebrations
of Victoria's jubilee, where its capacity to travel at over 34 knots so
impressed the Navy that <em>HMS Dreadnought</em> was fitted with his
turbines. Later on in the early years of the twentieth century, Cunard used
the turbines in their liners. Later work included the construction of
searchlights, also for use by the Navy, and large telescopes, following in
the footsteps of his father.

<DT> <a name="whb">Sir</a> William Henry Bragg, FRS, Nobel Laureate (1862 - 1942)

<DD><em>Location:</em>	the Parkinson Building of the University of Leeds
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>	18 March 1996 by Sir Arnold Wolfendale 
(President of the IOP)

<P> Having been brought up in his uncle's house after the death of his
mother, Bragg went on to study mathematics at Cambridge. He was an assiduous
worker, and graduated with first class honours. Soon after, he became
professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Adelaide, where he
published very little, but was very involved with the public understanding
of science, science education and university administration. He married an
astronomer's daughter, had a family, and took up golf. As part of his 1904
presidential address to a section of the Australian Association for the
Advancement of Science, however, he gave a highly critical talk on current
work in the field of the ionisation of gases, especially the scattering of
a, b and g rays by matter. Later on that year, at the age of 41, he began
the work that was to bring him wider recognition. He did experiments into
the absorption of a-particles, leading to the development of a method of
identifying radioactive substances. His next field of research was into the
nature of X-rays and g-rays, advocating a "quantised" view of X-rays. His
controversial view that ionisation of matter by these rays is a secondary
process involving a high speed electron was eventually confirmed by C.T.R.
Wilson's cloud chamber (see below). He became Cavendish professor of physics
at the University of Leeds in 1908, and together with his son (who was
working at the Cavendish) worked on the recently-discovered von-Laue
phenomenon. They became convinced that a theory of X-rays should take
account of both waves and corpuscles. The Braggs then became interested in
the inversion of the relation they had earlier discovered, nl =
2<em>d</em>sinq, to obtain the distances between atomic planes in a crystal
using a ray of known wavelength, thus transforming the analysis of crystal
structures into a straightforward procedure. During the First World War, he
did some research into crystals, but most of his time was spent in positions
of management and as an advisor. He worked on submarine detection, and was
knighted in 1920. During the war, Britain fell behind in X-ray spectroscopy,
but in 1923, Bragg became head of the Royal Institution, and set up a
research group to work on the analysis of organic crystals, a field in which
Britain was then able to excel. Bragg was President of the Royal Society
from 1935-1940. He had been a member of the Deutsche Physikalische
Gesellschaft since before the First World War, and at the outbreak of the
Second, tried unsuccessfully to further understanding between British and
German scientists. The last two years of his life were taken up with
scientific administration in the war effort.

<DT><a name="ctrw">Charles</a> Thomson Rees (C.T.R.) Wilson, Nobel Laureate 
(1869 - 1959)
<DD><em>Location:</em>	on a specially-built cairn at Flotterstone in the 
Pentland Hills, south of Edinburgh, a short distance from his birthplace
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>	10 April 1996 jointly by Dr. Lesley Glasser 
(Chairman of the Institute's Scottish Branch), and a Vice-President of the 
Royal Meteorological Society

<P>
As Wilson was a Scottish scientist born in the nineteenth century, he had to
have "Thomson" in his name. For variety, however, he chose to use it as a
middle name. Although born in Scotland, he moved to Manchester when he was
four years old. His immediate family was not well off, and his education was
paid for by his businessman step-brother, William, based in Calcutta. After
starting off as a medical student, he changed to physics, following a BSc at
Owens College, Manchester, with a period at Sidney Sussex College,
Cambridge. In order to support his mother after the death of his Calcutta
step-brother in 1892, he took a teaching job at Bradford Grammar School, but
after a short while, he returned to Cambridge, where he managed to support
himself by being a demonstrator for medical students. It was at this time
that Rutherford and his contemporaries started research in the department,
and Wilson often took part in their discussions. He was awarded the Clerk
Maxwell scholarship (less than twenty years after Maxwell had died) for
three years, then went on to hold posts as demonstrator, lecturer, and
finally Jacksonian professor of natural philosophy. Many honours were
bestowed upon him, including FRS in 1900 and a Nobel prize shared with A. H.
Compton in 1927, for their work on high-energy photon scattering. 

<P>
Wilson's blue plaque is on a cairn in the hills because he
was profoundly influenced by the beauty and truth of Nature. He spent much
of his life walking and climbing in Scotland, and used to spend time on Ben
Nevis, observing natural phenomena such as coronas, and electric storms. His
invention of the cloud chamber, an invaluable piece of apparatus in the
physicist's armoury, was inspired by his wish to emulate the stunning cloud
formations that he witnessed whilst on the mountains; and his research into
atmospheric electricity was stirred by experiencing his hair standing on end
when he was once caught in a storm. This gave him a glimpse of the magnitude
of the forces and fields he was investigating. His work on the conductivity
of air later inspired Victor Hess, who subsequently postulated the existence
of "cosmic radiation".

<DD><em>Location:</em>Eastbourne College
<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>by the IoP President, Dr.Brian Manley
<P>
As an Oxford Chemistry graduate, Soddy went to work as a demonstrator in
Montreal. There, he collaborated with Rutherford at the start of this
century on an explanation of the nature of radioactivity. In their
disintegration theory, they proposed that heavy atoms are unstable, and that
changes in their mass and charge cause the formation of new elements. In
1913, he was among those who formulated the radioactive displacement law of
emission of alpha and beta particles, and he gave us the word "isotopes".
Having gained a chair at Oxford, he became more involved with politics and
administration after his efforts to reform the teaching of chemistry went
unheeded. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921.

<DD><em>Unveiled: 	</em>12 March 1997 by Dr. Brian Manley, 
President of the IOP

<P>
Educated in Glasgow, Baird's initial studies were in electrical engineering.
He began serious experiment, however, in the early 1920s, after a serious
illness. His previous record of poor health had meant that his earlier
attempts to earn a living selling household goods were unsuccessful. His
first television apparatus was able to transmit and receive pictures over a
range of a few feet, and the first demonstration took place in two attic
rooms in Soho in 1926. In the following years, the range of his apparatus
increased rapidly, transmitting via telephone line from London to Glasgow in
1927, and to New York in 1928. The first BBC television pictures were
transmitted by Baird's company in 1929, but the system that the BBC
eventually adopted was that of Marconi-EMI. Although his particular methods
have now largely been superseded, he also experimented with stereo and
large-screen formats, and UHF transmission, pioneering techniques which are
often considered nowadays to be modern developments.

<DD><em>Unveiled:</em>	5 December 1997 by <em>Sir Bernard Lovell</em>
<P>
Appleton studied at what is now the Bradford and Ilkley Community College
from 1911 to 1913. He studied physics at Cambridge, but his interest in
radio waves stemmed from his time as a signals officer in the First World
War. After Kennelly and Heaviside had proposed the existence of a layer of
charged particles in the atmosphere, to explain the observation that it was
possible to send radio waves around the world, despite the propensity of
electromagnetic radiation to travel in straight lines, Appleton was the
first to demonstrate conclusively the existence of such a layer. By
measuring the interference between initial and reflected waves sent between
Bournemouth and Cambridge, he was able to calculate the height of this layer
to be 70 km above the Earth's surface. Although this first layer was named
after Heaviside, a second, slightly higher, layer was subsequently
discovered, and named after Appleton. He received the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1947.

protons accelerated to 700 keV. (They were jointly awarded the 1951 Nobel
prize for physics for this work on transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles). Two years after this
collaboration, in 1934, he<em> </em>returned to Trinity college, and
remained there until his retirement in 1974.<em> </em>Walton lived until the
age of 91, having presented his Nobel citation and medal to his college on
his 90th birthday. One of the reasons that Mary Robinson agreed

Dame Kathleen was one of the first women physicists to be elected to
Fellowship of the Royal Society. Although born in Ireland, Lonsdale moved to
London when she was a child, where she graduated in Physics in the early
1920s. After working at the Royal Institution for twenty years, she moved to
University College, London. It was there that she did her major work on the
structure of organic crystals, using X-ray diffraction. Having disclosed the
structure of hexamethylbenzene with this method, she went on to pioneer the
technique of using Fourier analysis to solve the structure of her next
organic compound, hexachlorobenzene. As a pacifist and Quaker, Lonsdale
spent a month in prison during the Second World War for failing to pay a
fine charged to her for not enrolling for any form of national service. 
Legend has it that she put her time in prison to good use by working 
theoretically on the classification scheme for crystals which later became
the <a href="http://iucr.org">International Tables of Crystallography</a> .
