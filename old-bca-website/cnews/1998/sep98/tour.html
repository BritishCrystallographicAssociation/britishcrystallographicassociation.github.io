<h1><a name="p34">The</a> UK Crystallographic Tourist - Help wanted</h1>
<HR>

<P>
I went to my local Tourist Office last week to find some information for a
friend who is planning to visit IUCr99 next year and wondered what
interesting scientific UK tourist sites could be visited between satellite
meetings and the main Conference or after the end of the Congress. Imagine
my horror when the tourist official said, '<strong>We don't have anything like
that, there wouldn't be any point. <em>There is no science in this
country</em></strong>'. So this article is my attempt to start writing a
crystallographic tourist guide. Many people are likely to visit London, so I
have listed some museums there. Others will be attending satellite meetings,
so I have listed attractions in the vicinity of Oxford and Cambridge. <BR>

<P>
I have found a few useful guides. John Wiley publishes a handy sized
paperback '<strong>Travel Guide to the Scientific Sites of the British
Isles: A Guide to the People, Places and Landmarks of science</strong>' by
Charles Tanford and Jacqueline Reynolds published in 1995 with 344 pages
ISBN 0 -471-95270-2  Prion published a book '<strong>London
Science</strong>' by Dennis and Sylvia Rosen in 1994 ISBN 1-85375-140-5 and
the British Library publishes a map '<strong>London, City of Science
walk'</strong>. I have also found a booklet '<strong>The Oxford Science
Walk</strong>' ISBN 0-952- 2671-0 1 by Sophie Huxley illustrated with
attractive line drawings by Edith Gollnast, including one of Dorothy
Hodgkin. I bought my copy in Blackwells, price &pound;2. They can also be
obtained from the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford (closed for
building works until Spring 1999 ) or from the publisher 'Science Walk
Publications' 35 Marston Street, Oxford OX4 1JU. <BR> 

<P>
I should like members to send me details of any scientifically interesting
tourist sites, particularly those near University Departments with interests
in Crystallography. I also need your help in finding further useful guide
books, museums or scientific sites anywhere in the country. I will put all
this information on the BCA Web site, and update it regularly to make a
useful guide for visitors to IUCr99. <BR>

<P>
I am also compiling a list of British scientists who are either
crystallographers ( defined as those listed over the map of the UK in the
IUCr's 'Historical Atlas of Crystallography' editor J.Lima-de-faria), or
others whose instruments or inventions are vital to our modern
crystallography; for example where would cryogenics be today without the
work of James Dewar?  I should also appreciate your suggestions as to which
people to include. Turn to the 'Competition Page' to see how to win a
&pound;20 book token for your efforts.  

<P>
The list below contains <a href="../tour/musem.html">museums </a>
arranged by geographic location in the UK.
On the Web I plan to link the places to their web sites, and make the
list of scientists accessible in two orders, alphabetically by surname and
by location. Please tell me of other places or people who should be in the
list. 

<P>
One starting place for information can be found in the article on the
Institute of Physics <a href="../sep98/bluep.html">'Blue Plaque'</a>
 scheme later in this newsletter. A new
plaque has been proposed for Kathleen Lonsdale. Please write to the address
given there to support her case.</p>

<h1>UK Museums and interactive science centres</h1>
<HR>
<P>
<strong>London</strong>
<P>
  <em>South Kensington</em> - Science Museum, Natural History Museum.
<P>
  <em>Westminster Abbey</em> - look at the marble patterns on the floor, how
many plane groups are represented? There are tombs of famous scientists such
as Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin, and memorial plaques to others such as
George Green (who discovered the functions now named after him).

<P>
<strong>Near London</strong>
<P>
 <em>BLETCHLEY</em>, near Milton Keynes, where you can see the Computer
Conservation Society's collection and the rebuilding of COLOSSUS.

<P>
<strong>South West England</strong>
<P>
  <em>BRISTOL </em>- the Exploratory, the Great Eastern, the Clifton Suspension bridge
<P>
<strong>The Midlands</strong>
<P>
 <em>READING </em>- the Museum has a Victorian replica of the Bayeux
Tapestry, (nothing to do with crystallography but fun to see if you are in
central Reading) and interesting tessellations in Victorian tiles on the
ground floor. There is a Museum of Rural Life near the University. 

<P>
 <em>OXFORD</em>, CuriOxcity, University Museum, Museum of the History of
Science, look for the tiling patterns on the floor of the Covered Market and
in many of the College chapels.

<P>
  <em>NOTTINGHAM</em>, Green's Mill is now an interactive science centre
<P>
  Derbyshire, <em>Blue John Mine</em> (famous because of the BSG David Blow 
trophy )
<P>
  C<em>hatsworth,</em> Derbyshire, home of the Cavendish family. William 
founded the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge
<P>
<em>CAMBRIDGE </em>- the Old Cavendish laboratory famous for many
experiments, including the discovery of DNA by Watson and Crick; the British
Antarctic Survey; the Sedgewick museum (unusual in that it is the 'Inside'
of the museum which is 'listed' )

<P>
<strong>Northern England</strong>
<P>
CHESHIRE - Salt museum, Northwich, Catalyst Museum of the Chemical Industry,
 Widnes
<P>
Daresbury Church has a memorial stained glass window to Lewis Carroll's
father nearby- WARRINGTON has a memorial to Joseph Priestley discoverer of
oxygen
<P>
HALIFAX - the  Eureka interactive science centre by Halifax railway station 
<P>
KENDAL - has John Dalton's birthplace, and the Quaker Tapestry with an
embroidered portrait of Kathleen Lonsdale and hexamethyl benzene. Nearby is
the birthplace, of Adam Sedgewick (See Cambridge) and a  'geology trail'
with accompanying leaflet pointing out the rock formations he found and
wrote about, making him a father of modern geology.

<P>
MANCHESTER-  Museum of Science and Technology,  Manchester Museum 
(50 years of Computing exhibit)
<P>
 
<P>
I have only listed sites in England because that is where I live, and I have
visited most of these sites. I am sure there are many in other parts of the
UK and I am hoping that BCA members will tell me where they are so that I
can add them to our Web site.
