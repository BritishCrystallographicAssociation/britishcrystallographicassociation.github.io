Dear XRD colleague,

<P>
Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., in cooperation with the International Centre for
Diffraction Data (ICDD), is planning on sponsoring an X-ray powder
diffraction conference focused on topics of interest to the pharmaceutical
community.  The three-day conference would be held at a location at the East
Coast of the US in spring or autumn 1999.

<P>
Proposed topics for the conference would include:
<ul>
 <li>issues involved in the patenting of crystal forms of drug substances 
(e.g. proper presentation of PXRD data in patents), 
 <li>Rietveld methods for quantification of pharmaceutical crystal forms 
and more traditional quantification methods, 
 <li>indexing of powder patterns, 
 <li>structure determination of pharmaceuticals from powder diffraction data.
</ul>
<P>
If you have interest in attending, presenting a paper or poster, or would
just like to stay informed about the conference plans, please contact one of
the following individuals. 

<P>
We would very much appreciate, if you would complete the <a href="#form">
enclosed form</a>. 
However, a simple reply to this letter (by letter, E-mail, phone, or FAX) 
is sufficient.

<P>
Please send your replies to one of the following addresses latest by
 August 15 1998
