<h2>Open Days at ISIS 1998</h2>
<HR>

<P>
The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's Open Days ran from 26 June - 2 July,
and attracted an estimated 4,700 members of the public, school children,
academics, people from industry and other invited guests. ISIS opened its
doors to display its science and instrumentation, with demonstrations giving
an introduction to the facility, and exhibits in the ISIS experimental hall
providing insights into crystallography, muons, large scale structures,
excitations and computing. Highlights of the ISIS displays included an
extended visit by Professor Chadwick, (played by Chris Frost), who explained
to impressed audiences how he discovered the neutron, and a working set of
manipulators, used for remote handling of the ISIS neutron target, skilful
use of which enabled visitors to pick up and recover sweets. A new ISIS
video explaining the work of the facility could be viewed in a small cinema
area; interactive exhibits included demonstrations of synchrotron magnet
operation, neutron reflectometry, atomic vibrations and detector encoding.
In addition to the main display areas, school parties were invited to
undertake extended projects lasting about an hour on subjects such as
diffraction and superconductivity; a comment from one young visitor: '<em>I
really enjoyed looking round ISIS and being able to use all the machines on
the tour. I found ISIS really amazing, the way the machine works is
absolutely staggering'.</em><BR>

The Computing Division at RAL was demonstrating uses of the Internet showing
visitors how to search for interesting topics, they helpfully found several
references to crystal growing for me, sites with many pictures of crystals,
and a site with an explanation of the inner workings of a quartz watch. I
have links to these sites into an 'Introductory' page on the BCA web
site to try to attract children to crystallography. 
 'Introduction' is accurate but dull, one member suggested I call it
<a href="../../ed/wond.html">'Crystal Wonderland'</a>. Take a look

<H2>Meeting Report: X-rays in Magnetism<BR>Daresbury Laboratory, 
10-11 July 1998</h2>


<P>
It was said that nobody would travel to Daresbury for a  meeting on World
Cup Final weekend. But how wrong they were! The <strong><em>X-rays in
Magnetism</em></strong> workshop attracted over 50 delegates, eager to talk
about work carried out at many of the major Synchrotron laboratories
world-wide, including the APS (Argonne, USA), ESRF (Greoble, France), LURE
(Orsay, France) and, of course, the SRS at Daresbury. Opening the meeting,
<strong>Bob Cernik</strong> invited participants to enjoy the facilities at
Daresbury, especially the 'touchy-feely' exhibits in the newly-opened
Science Centre where coffee and poster sessions were held. Indeed,
throughout the meeting, a number of eminent  Professors were spotted eagerly
taking Bob up on his offer!

<P>
The serious business was started by <strong>Gerrit van der Laan</strong>,
and we had to put on our thinking-caps to learn about the famous sum-rules
in X-ray dichroism - plus some new ones - and how they can be derived using
very attractive diagrammatic techniques. The next two talks described some
interesting X-ray diffraction results from very different systems.
<strong>John Hill</strong> outlined the mystery of
PrBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>6.9 </SUB>- the '123' superconductor
that isn't, and discussed how the discovery of a long-period static magnetic
modulation in both Pr and Cu might shed light on this anomaly. X-ray
diffraction was also used to confirm unambiguously the presence of orbital
ordering in another transition metal oxide, LaMnO<SUB>3</SUB>, by the purely
resonant nature of the scattering and its unique polarization-dependence.
Moving away from 3d metals, <strong>Sean Langridge</strong> described
diffraction studies of uranium compounds, where very strong resonance
enhancements are observed, and measurements on the antiferromagnet
DyF<SUB>4</SUB>Al<SUB>8</SUB>. The latter was shown to exhibit large
variations in the <em>L</em><SUB>2,3</SUB> branching ratio with temperature,
which was attributed to subtle changes in the magnetic ground-state.
Continuing with the crystal diffraction theme, <strong>Ted Forgan</strong>
focused on magnetic structure studies of Nd, and outlined the Herculean task
of refining a vast number of X-ray diffraction peaks to shed light on the
complex array of structures exhibited by this metal.

<P>
Theoretical developments were very much in evidence throughout the workshop.
Atomic calculations of <strong>Stephen Lovesey</strong>, describing electric
dipole and quadrupole transitions in NiO, were presented and compared with
the predictions of dichroic sum-rules. A rather different approach -
relativistic multiple-scattering theory - was championed by <strong>Paul
Strange</strong>. For those of us left wanting more after an elegant
overview, there is Paul's new book from Cambridge University Press!
<strong>Ceri Jenkins</strong> described how self-consistent
linear-muffin-tin-orbital calculations on Gd/Mo multilayers were able to
correlate the induced Mo moment with a volume-expansion in the spacer-layer.

<P>
One of the dominant topics of the workshop - diffraction from magnetic
multilayer structures - was addressed though numerous studies with both soft
and hard X-ray diffraction techniques. <strong>Denis Raoux</strong>
demonstrated how the wavelength and energy of soft X-ray beams were ideally
suited to exploit the strong magnetic resonances in 3d metal multilayer
structures, providing a highly-sensitive, element-specific probe of magnetic
ordering. This theme was continued by <strong>Tom Hase</strong>, who
reported measurements of magnetic coupling (both bi-linear and bi-quadratic)
in Cu/Co GMR multilayers, performed recently at the SRS on a prototype soft
X-ray diffractometer. But hard X-ray studies were not be left out, and
particularly pretty examples were described by Denis Roaux and <strong>John
Goff</strong>, who presented measurements of the magnetic profiles of
induced moments in Ce and Pr layers, respectively. <strong>George
Srajer</strong> outlined X-ray diffraction studies confirming the transition
from aligned to twisted coupling in Fe/Gd multilayers.

<P>
Bulk dichroism measurements were discussed by <strong>Steve
Collins</strong>, in the form of X-ray Faraday Rotation, and <strong>Pedro
Montano</strong>, who showed some fascinating, and quite unexpected, results
from Gd metal.  The sensitivity of circular dichroism  was evident from
<strong>Derek Eastham</strong>'s talk on cobalt clusters.

<P>
Magnetic inelastic scattering, in the form of Compton scattering, provides a
complementary approach to studying ferromagnetic materials, probing
spin-densities in momentum-space. J<strong>ohn Duffy </strong>described the
current state-of-play, giving examples of 4f and 3d magnetism, and showing
how magnetic Compton profiles provide an extremely sensitive test-bed for
band-structure models.

<P>
Summing-up, <strong>Malcolm Cooper</strong> reflected on a highly successful
workshop, and closed the meeting in time for British delegates to get home
for the third-place playoff, and  the French to celebrate their team's
victory in the Final the following day.

<h2>Meeting Report VUVCD  for Structural Biology</h2>

    The 1st Vacuum Ultra Violet Circular Dichroism (VUVCD) meeting was held
in the Synchrotron Radiation Department at Daresbury Laboratory. VUVCD is a
technique which is used by many biologists to provide important quantitative
information on the proportions of alpha helix, beta sheet and random content
of their systems. It is also used by many protein crystallographers as an
ancillary structural tool.The use of the SRS for CD, rather than commercial
off-line systems, has significant benefits for this community.   

<P>
   About 50 delegates from UK academia and industry attended this first
meeting to review the work of the current UK national facilities at King's
College, London, Stirling University and the SRS and to highlight the
potential for a proposed new beamline at the SRS  to provide an extreme flux
SRCD facility. SRCD, ( Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism ). offers a
larger wavelength range than conventional systems and hence a more accurate
determination of protein secondary structure. More importantly, the high
intensity of the SRS means that very fast dynamic experiments can be carried
out (approx 1 ms) and projects such as protein folding are currently
benefiting from the facility. A stopped-flow device has been developed at DL
which is currently fastest in the world and available for measurements of
this type.

<P>
  Some research using CD facilities at the SRS would test current theories
on the mis-folding of the prion protein which has resulted in the BSE
epidemic.  Other speakers had similar projects . Delegates agreed that a
National Structural Biology Centre would be a world leading facility and
provide a mechanism for co-ordinating CD within the UK.  An application has
been made to the BBSRC for funds to construct this facility.The new beamline
would also transfer to DIAMOND, the new machine. For further details
