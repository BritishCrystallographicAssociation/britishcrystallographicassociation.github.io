<h1><strong>The mechanism of <em>Beevers-Lipson Strips</em></strong></h1>

Today, when Fourier transforms on several thousand data items for large,
three dimensional unit cells at a resolution of about 0.3 &Aring; require
less time than it takes to gulp down a cup of coffee, it is difficult to
imagine the size of the task confronting early crystallographers, where this
operation was almost unthinkable.  After all, even a two dimensional
summation of:

</p>
<P Align=left>
for 500 data items into 2000 points requires 10<SUP>6</SUP> summations, let
alone any work required to calculate the trigonometric functions!  The great
contribution of Beevers and Lipson in 1936 was twofold: to simplify the
calculations greatly by factorising the trigonometric expressions to reduce
the two dimensional calculations to many fewer one dimensional ones, and to
provide a convenient technique for carrying out the summations - the strips
themselves.  The factorisation technique is still at the heart of many
computer programs. The expression given above expands to:

That may hardly seem an advantage!  However, in the centrosymmetric plane
group <em>p</em>2<em>mm</em>,  for example, with equivalent reflections
<em>F(h,k) = F( -h,-k) = F( -h,k) = F( h,-k) </em>and no phase shift among
equivalent data, combination of these reflections causes all terms involving
sines to disappear, leaving <img alt="equation 3" src="eqn3.gif">.

<P>
The data were sorted to minimise the number of changes in h.  Thus a set of
summations for each ky need only be followed by a single summation for that
hx. 

<BR><BR>The boxes of strips themselves have virtually disappeared
although they were once almost universal in the crystallographic community.

Over 500 sets were sold between 1948 and 1970, and a photograph of
Arnold Beevers and Henry Lipson in bathing attire with the caption "Beevers
and Lipson stripped" was an instant hit in an informal precursor of
'<em>Crystallography News'!</em><BR>
<BR>I am most grateful to  Richard
Glazer of Oxford Cryosystems, who kindly photographed this handsome boxed
set which still survives in the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University in 
1998. <br>

You can see that the strips themselves (4000 of them in the final version!)
were handsomely boxed for convenient use.<BR><BR>
The original version had strips representing Fcos 2pihx and Fsin 2pihx
corresponding to amplitudes from 1 to 99 and from h = 0 to 20. Later ones
doubled the resolution by printing the even values on one side of the strip
and the odd ones on the other.

<P>
The actual strip illustrated below is a cosine (C) strip, for F = 19 and h = 3, giving values of  Fcos 2phx for 2px from 0 to 90&deg;, i.e. x from 0 to 0.25. Suitable reversing of direction and sign enabled other parts of the range to be studied.

	For a one dimensional sum, the appropriate strips were arranged one under the other and the columns summed:  The following shows the start of an array of cosine strips, here for h = 0,1,2,and 3 and F = 46, -35,  28 and -19.

Some people used mechanical calculators for the sums, but most found it far 
quicker and more accurate to use mental arithmetic, a skill more widely found 
then than now.   <BR>In fact a BBC documentary of a few years ago showing 
Rosalind Franklin with a box of strips laboriously cranking them into a 
mechanical calculator was almost certainly apocryphal.  She would not have 
wasted time on that!

in 'Crystallography News' issue 65 June 1998 p 38,39  where further details
can be found.  A photo of both Beevers and Lipson, each carrying a box of
strips and dressed in conventional attire was published in 'Crystallography
News' issue 37 June 1991 p 16 accompanied a report of a session on

1991 during the 10th annual Spring meeting of the BCA held in Sheffield in
1991.
