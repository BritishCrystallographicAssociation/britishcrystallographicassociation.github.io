<h2>Meeting Report - XTOP98  Durham,  September 1998</h2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<strong>4th European Conference on High Resolution <br>
X-ray Diffraction and Topography</strong>

<P>
	The 4th biennial conference on High Resolution Diffraction and Topography
was held at the University of Durham, U.K. from Wednesday 9th September to
Friday 11th September 1998. Durham University is the third oldest English
university and in keeping with this tradition, delegates were housed in the
original college, University College. As the college buildings include the
11th Century castle overlooking Palace Green and the Cathedral, this World
Heritage Site provided a spectacular backdrop  for what was a stimulating
and memorable conference.

<P>
Scientific sessions were held in the Physics Department of the University
and the scale of the meeting was such that we were able to hold a small
specialist commercial exhibition in the same room in which refreshments were
served. The Poster Sessions were in adjacent rooms, with the lecture theatre
nearby, which made for a compact and closely-knit atmosphere.

<P>
The format of the scientific sessions reverted to that of the first two
meetings (Marseilles and Berlin) with primary emphasis on poster
presentations, allowing ample time for informal discussion. We had 135
delegates, with 176 papers accepted by the Programme Committee. Sadly many
of these papers were from colleagues in Russia and former Soviet Republics
who were not able to travel due to the financial crisis which broke just
before the meeting. 28 papers were selected for oral presentation,
principally on grounds of programme coherence and balance.  Following their
success at an X-ray imaging workshop in Grenoble last year, we experimented
by including three "Poster Highlights" sessions in which authors of poster
papers were given two minutes in which to show the key results and convince
other delegates that their paper was worth visiting. The self-discipline of
the participants in these 90 minute sessions was outstanding and,
unexpectedly, they proved easy to chair. While one delegate commented that
90 minutes reading abstracts could have been more profitable, my own view
(which I believe is shared by the majority of participants) is that they
were extremely informative and memorable. I certainly found the subsequent
poster sessions much more interesting and effective.

Each X-TOP meeting has had its own emphasis. Perhaps unsurprisingly the
Durham meeting featured phase contrast imaging strongly with a keynote paper
by Peter Cloetens (ESRF) reviewing the dramatic developments stimulated by
the extraordinary phase coherence which was found in the (long) ID19 X-ray
topography beamline at the ESRF. A very significant number of the
experiments on that beamline now involve some form of phase contrast
imaging, expanding the range of problems studied to include biological,
structural and composite materials. Jo Gastaldi (Marseille) showed how the
combination of phase and diffraction imaging has thrown new light on the
growth mechanisms of quasi-crystals, whose 5-fold symmetry remains of
topical interest to crystallographers. Anatoly Snigirev (ESRF) showed how
new developments in focusing optics opened up possibilities of new X-ray
imaging techniques, which included microfluorescence imaging on the
micrometre scale. His was one of several outstandingly elegant presentations
in which the full power of data projection from a PC was exploited. Elegance
of a different kind was evident in the opening invited paper by Richard
Deslattes (NIST). His gentle sense of humour combined with a clear an lucid
description of outstanding high resolution diffraction experiments forming
part of the project to define Avogadro's number set both the tone and level
of the meeting. Similarly impressive were Cev Noyan's (IBM) microdiffraction
measurements of strains in the aluminium interconnects of silicon integrated
circuit devices.

Harmut Metzger (Munich) led the invited speakers on the last day, showing
the power of grazing incidence diffraction techniques to probe the in-plane
lattice parameter of quantum dot and wire structures. In a beautifully
structured talk, he demonstrated how analysis techniques have developed
using finite element modelling to determine the strains within these
nanoscale features. In the only theoretical invited paper, Anatoly Andreev
(Moscow) presented his theoretical model of grazing incidence scattering
outside of the Born wave approximation. In a thoughtfully prepared talk,
which emphasised physical understanding over mathematical detail, he showed
how analysis of X-ray scattering from very rough surfaces was now in
principle possible. Chris Lucas (Liverpool) described how surface
diffraction experiments could be exploited for <I>in-situ</I> studies of
surface reactions and Stefano Lagomarsino (Rome) completed the invited
papers with a description of how sub-micron sources of coherent radiation
can now be obtained using thin film waveguide structures. The invited
speakers deserve special thanks for setting the level for both the
contributed oral talks and the poster presentations.

We have reverted to the tradition set by the first two meetings of
publishing the proceedings as a regular issue of the Journal of Physics D
(Applied Physics). Just over 60 papers containing new and original work have
been submitted and are now in the process of being refereed to the normal
standards of the journal. Publication is scheduled for April 1999.

An original aim of the XTOP conferences was to stimulate the use of X-ray
diffraction  topography at the new ID19 facility of the ESRF. Another was to
bring together the diffraction imaging and high resolution diffraction
communities, to enhance the science in both areas. The quality and range of
the scientific contributions suggests that both aims have been achieved. It
was pleasing to find that the sense of comradeship, spiced with genuine but
friendly rivalry, has not been lost. The social atmosphere of the conference
was excellent, helped to some extent by the competition, engineered by Peter
Hatton, in which Bede Scientific, Bruker and Philips vied with each other to
provide the most wine for dinner each night.  A concert of English choral
music, with a distinct North Country flavour was the cultural highlight. 10%
of the delegates purchased CDs of the choir after the concert!

<P>
The success of the conference is largely due to the efforts put in by the
local team. It was a delight to see my group working so well together with
such spirit.  Particular thanks are due to the conference secretary Nikki
Bingham whose detailed preparative work and friendly welcome led not only to
an extremely smooth and orderly meeting but one which participants will
remember with pleasure for a very long time to come.
