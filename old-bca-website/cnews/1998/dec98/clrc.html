 <h2>RAL Neutron and Muon User Meeting</h2>
<HR>

<P>
The UK Neutron and Muon User meeting was held on 16 and 17 September 1998
with technical sessions at RAL and accommodation at Keble College in Oxford.
The Chairman, <strong>Philip Withers</strong>, Manchester, welcomed users
and introduced the first session, '<strong><em>Scientific Highlights and
future opportunities'. </em></strong>

<P>
<strong>Andrew Taylor,</strong> ISIS, described the improving reliability of
the accelerator and a collaborative project with Frankfurt, part of the
design studies for the '<em>European  Spallation Source'</em>, which is
hoped will result in much improved reliability by replacing the ISIS aging
Cockcroft-Walton set with an RF quadrupole. New instruments delivered are
TOSCA and OSIRIS; progressing well are MAPS, GEMS, the PRISMA Guide and the
Advanced sample environment. Upgrades are being planned for ENGIN-X, SXD-II
and HRPD90. Feedback from users indicates 90% satisfaction with ISIS staff,
80% with the equipment, but much less with the accommodation and food on
site and speed of processing user expenses claims. The external review of
ISIS was to be presented to the CLRC the next week: Andrew was hoping they
would support the 300 <em>m</em>amp upgrade to ISIS and the building of a
second target station.  The ISIS Annual report for 1998 is now available
from the User Liaison Service (email <strong>ULS@isise.rl.ac.uk</strong>)
and on the RAL Web site at:

<P align=left>
it includes the text and images in the printed version and all 600 
experimental reports on a CD-ROM. 

<P>
Three ISIS developments were described: <strong>Chris Frost,</strong>
(Recent science from HET following the installation of the PSD and plans for
MAPS with its 36,000 pixels), <strong>Sean Langridge</strong>, (Spin
polarised reflectivity, multi layer systems, magnetism and polarised
neutrons) and <strong>Mark Daymond</strong>, (Engineering the Future, work
on polycrystalline materials, typically metals or ceramics, modelling the
action of rivets used in the aerospace industry when one failure amongst the
millions used may have fatal consequences, work on standards for measurement
and plans for an improved instrument capable of handling large samples, up
to one ton).

<P>
<strong>Alan Leadbetter</strong> then described improved facilities at the
ILL, Grenoble. IN4 is commissioning with neutrons. Work progresses on the
3He spin filter prototype which is likely to be useful on several beam
lines, and also used as a routine tool in hospitals to measure the dynamics
of lung function using MRI techniques. Upgrades to instruments include: D17
being converted to be a new reflectometer,  D16 a new focussing
monochromator, D4 a new large detector, IN8 the primary spectrometer is
being rebuilt. The rebuild of the IN5 spectrometer is delayed, they hope to
install it in the year 2000.  A new 5 year Investment Plan will start next
year; users are invited to send their ideas for consideration; proposals
received so far include: instruments for polarisation analysis with thermal
neutrons, another with an image plate detector optimised for protein
crystallography with thermal neutrons and a dedicated strain scanning
diffractometer. Phil Withers is leading a bid to the EPSRC for a CRG in this
area.  Users want more support staff and better documentation preferably on
the World Wide Web. Two ILL users described  recent research;  <strong>Ted
Forgan </strong>spoke on high T<SUB>c</SUB> materials using D22 and a
dilution refrigerator. <strong>Helmut Schober</strong> described the use of
high pressure on cold time-of-flight spectrometers with applications in
measurement of the order/disorder transition in C60 and the dynamics of the
newly discovered phase, ice XII.

<P>
<strong>Andrew Taylor</strong> then gave an update on international
activities, XENNI, a 10 member European network on neutron instrumentation,
ENSA, the European Neutron scattering Association, support for the IUCr99 in
Glasgow, (RAL are arranging one of the satellite meetings and running the
electronic abstract submission ) and the sixth Oxford neutron scattering
school. There is also the OECD Mega Science Forum, with a neutron source
working group about to report. They are likely to suggest a 3 part strategy:
maintenance of existing sources, maximise their utilisation and prepare for
new facilities of next generation sources.

<P>
<strong>Jane Nicholson</strong>, EPSRC Swindon) spoke on access to
facilities at the ILL and ISIS, funding mechanisms and improving the service
standards for the ISIS facility.

<P>
After lunch the meeting split into parallel subject sessions on the
following topics:  High Resolution Spectroscopy, Disordered Materials,
Excitations, Engineering, Muons, large scale structures and Biology,
magnetic structures and non-magnetic structures (this being crystallography
of course).  There were problems with this large numbers of parallel
sessions, some had too few people to have a meaningful discussion, while
some users would have liked to attend several sessions at the same time.  A
Poster session followed in the RAL exhibition area before delegates were
taken by bus into Keble College for dinner and overnight accommodation.

<P>
Next morning <strong>Paolo Radaelli </strong>gave the plenary lecture on
'<strong><em>Neutrons and X-rays in CMR research: Stripes and much
more</em></strong>'. He studies manganese perovskites because of their rich
physics and for the large number of potential applications. Electron
microscopy shows stripes with spacing of 8.5 Angstroms on the surface of
these materials which are not yet understood.

<P>
After coffee the subject session chairmen presented their reports. Users
think that the current mechanism of adding the cost of beam time to their
grants discourages applications from new small users and those with ideas
for new techniques which are untried, appear expensive, and hence are
usually rejected.  All groups expressed support for the ISIS intensity
upgrade and the second target station, and reservations about the ticket
system.  There can also be problems in scheduling popular ISIS instruments
in relation to the timing of ISIS experimental rounds and there is a need
for more  flexible 'Direct Access' beam time at ISIS to allow timely
experiments on new ideas. Some spoke of the potential advantages to the
science &lt;of neutron and photon facilities being on the same site, as they
are in Grenoble and in the USA at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. This
allows cross-fertilisation between the 2 user groups and means an increasing
number of people now use both neutrons and X-rays in their research.  The
Engineering report included a plea to satisfy the desperate need for user
training in this area. The Large Scale Structures report stated that the
biological community was poorly represented at this meeting which means that
their special needs for sample preparation may go unheeded. They encourage
the greater sharing of software amongst users. All groups wanted more and
better accommodation on site at ISIS, better transport to the site and
improved food especially at weekends. 

<P>
During the later discussion <strong>Alan Leadbetter</strong> commented that
he believes it wrong that changes in rules for application for beam time at
ISIS will mean ILL scientists are no longer eligible to apply. This would
impede co-operation between the ILL and ISIS to the detriment of users, and
he wanted to know what could be done about this. It is clear that there is
no intention for this to happen and the traditional interchanges between
scientists at the two facilities should continue. <P> The meeting ended with
short presentations from the poster prize winners, <strong>Adrian Hillier,
Sue Kilcoyne, Trevor Riley, Miles Hamilton and Abdul Muslim.</strong>

<h1>More stress with neutrons</h1>
<HR>
<P>
<em>The measurement of stress using neutron diffraction is a rapidly growing
field, of great relevance both to the academic materials science world and
to the industrial world of structural engineering.  Recent developments
towards the introduction of an international standard for neutron stress
measurement, coupled with European Union funded ventures to bring the
technique to a broader range of industry are stimulating an increasing
interest in the technique.</em>

<P>
<strong>History</strong>
<P>
The techniques required for measuring stress inside a material using neutron
diffraction were first developed at the Harwell laboratory in the early
1970's.  Since then, both UK and international academic engineering and
materials science communities have continued to develop the technique and
expand its applicability and usefulness.  The UK community is still one of
the world leaders in the field, as was evidenced by the construction of a
leading rank stress measurement diffractometer at ISIS [1], and by the
leading roles played in many related international projects by UK
practitioners.

<P>
Internal and residual stresses in materials have a considerable effect on
material properties, including fatigue resistance fracture toughness and
strength.  In the early days of neutron stress measurements, experiments
were aimed at identifying high stress areas, and likely sources of failure
in components or joints (e.g. welds), and thus improving component
lifetimes.  While this traditional area of interest continues to make up a
major fraction of the neutron stress measurements carried out, the technique
has diversified, with a strong emphasis on process model validation -
leading to improved design to product times and to improvements in both
production costs and safety.  Academic users of the technique on the other
hand, are often interested in investigating fundamentals of materials
deformation, that is how the stress state within the material relates to
material deformation and ultimately failure.

<P>
<strong>Introduction to the technique</strong>
<P>
Relying on the same physics describing the analogous measurement of stress
using x-ray diffraction [2], neutrons have two principal benefits compared
to x-rays for the engineer or materials scientist.

<P>
Firstly, neutrons interact primarily with the nucleus, rather than the
electron cloud as x-rays do, so the penetration depth of neutrons is very
large compared to x-rays.  For example, the penetration depth (1/e) for
steel is ~1cm for thermal neutrons, but less than 10 <em>m</em>m for x-rays
of comparable wavelength [3].  Hence in neutrons are a probe suitable for
bulk average measurements of material properties, compared to x-rays, which
useful primarily for measurements of surface layers.  For many practical
applications, the engineer or material scientist is primarily interested in
the bulk properties.

<P>
Secondly, since the scattering cross section of neutrons varies considerably
across the periodic table, neutrons can be successfully scattered from both
very light (e.g. Li, Be) and heavier (e.g. Fe, W) elements, with good
penetration depths.  In practice, this technique can be used on nearly any
crystalline sample.

<P>
When a stress measurement is made using neutrons, an incoming neutron beam
is diffracted from the sample.  From Bragg's law the lattice parameter can
be determined, as a function of direction within the sample. The incoming
and outgoing beams are collimated [1] so that only a certain region within
the sample contributes to the diffraction spectra.  By moving the sample
around within the beam, the position of the sampling volume within the
sample can be scanned, providing a map of atomic lattice plane distances. 
Alternatively the sample may be held within a loading rig, capable of
applying stress or pressure, a furnace or a cryostat. The sample can then be
monitored during <em>in situ</em> variation of the thermo-mechanical
environment. Accurate measurement of lattice parameter (accuracy of
~3x10-4&Aring; is typical) is required to allow a correct evaluation of
strain changes.

<P>
Pulsed neutron sources, such as ISIS, provide data which is analogous to
energy dispersive x-rays.  If we consider Bragg's equation, at a nuclear
reactor or monochromatic x-ray source, we use a single wavelength.  Changes
in d-spacing are monitored as changes in the diffraction angle. 
Alternatively, we can fix the scattering angle <em>q</em>, and instead
monitor changes in d-spacing as changes in wavelength.  This is possible
since de Broglie's relation links the neutron's wavelength to its velocity. 
The velocity can be determined simply by measuring the time taken for a
neutron to travel a known distance - from creation in the spallation event,
to detection after scattering.  The major advantage of the pulsed neutron
technique over reactor sources, is that an entire diffraction spectra is
produced for a fixed detector angle.  This means multiple phases can be
easily monitored, and experimental apparatus to make measurements at a fixed
sample orientation is much simpler (e.g. windows within high pressure cells
or furnaces).

<P>
<strong>Increasing demand and international standards<BR></strong>Industrial
demand has led to two European funded networks, containing members from
industry, academia and neutron facilities.  <strong>RESTAND,</strong> a
network run by the JRC in the Netherlands aims to establish best practice
for neutron measurements.  <strong>TRAINSS</strong>, a network run by ISIS
in the UK, aims to introduce industries to the technique and train them in
measurement practice and interpretation.  Companies in these networks
include British Aerospace, Rolls Royce, Nuclear Electric, Mercedes,
Volkswagen, Fiat, Peugeout/Citroen, Pieraleisi, Sintec, SNCF, AEA Technology
and Schunk.  Both networks have already successfully carried out
measurements.

<P>
The <strong>VAMAS</strong> TWA20 initiative, headed by Imperial College,
London, is made up mostly of  academics and representatives from facilities
around the world; it is working to define an <strong>international standard
for stress measurement using neutrons</strong>.  As well as detailing best
practice for measurements and data interpretation, the project will involve
four different round robin samples which will be measured at each neutron
facility.  Each is typical of a problem found in real measurements:
<strong>high strain gradients, multiple phases, through surface strain
measurements, and large compositional variations</strong>.   The first two
round robin samples were successfully completed by October 1998 by all
facilities with good agreement. The third is being measured now; the fourth
will be distributed next year.

<P>
<strong>Responding to the demand</strong>
<P>
The present facilities available to the UK community are already heavily
oversubscribed and in great demand. These include the ENGIN instrument at
ISIS; it is located on the PEARL beamline which is shared between the
engineering programme ( on ENGIN ) and the high pressure programme (HiPr). 
At the ILL neutron reactor at Grenoble, the UK community has access to time
through the peer review system, to the D1A beam-line, which is also
available for engineering studies for 50% of the time.  The UK community has
responded in two ways to the great demand for experimental time.  In the
short term, a proposal has been submitted to the EPSRC for a Collaborative
Research Group project to run D1A at the ILL 100% of the time for an
engineering program. This will quickly provide more access for the UK
academic community for relatively small capital cost and the funding of two
instrument scientists   However, UK users want a facility closer to home. 
Unlike many other industrial countries (e.g. Germany, France, Sweden,
Denmark, Netherlands, Czech Republic and Hungary) there is no longer a
neutron scattering reactor facility in the UK.  The UK community therefore
relies primarily on ISIS where demand for time at ISIS is very high,
including heavy demand from outside the European Community.  While the ENGIN
instrument at ISIS is still world leading, it was constructed in the early
1990's on an existing beamline as a compromise and development instrument. 
An order of magnitude improvement over the existing instrument can be
achieved by building an optimised instrument on a dedicated beamline.  A
university consortium has therefore submitted a proposal to the EPSRC for
ENGIN-X, a dedicated stress measurement diffractometer. ENGIN-X will be able
to measure stresses in real engineering components of up to 1 ton in weight,
scan tiny sampling volumes (sub-millimetre) within materials, and apply
realistic loads and temperatures to test pieces.  As well as providing
sufficient capacity to meet the growing demands of industry, ENGIN-X will
open up new avenues of academic research, allowing faster time resolution of
time-dependent processes (e.g. thermo-mechanical fatigue), greater spatial
resolution of high stress gradients (e.g. barrier coatings), study of
stresses deeper within materials (larger components), and more complete
studies, whether this be 2D mapping rather than 1D scans of spatial
variation, or more complete parametric studies.

<P>
A training network has been proposed to help cope with the increasing demand
from academic users. This will allow novice users to accompany more
experienced ones on experiments at neutron facilities where they will learn
by example, helping with the experiments and discussing the results and
their interpretation. Help with proposal writing will also be given.
