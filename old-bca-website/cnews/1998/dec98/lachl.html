<h2>The Importance of New and Readily Available Crystallographic Software<br>
 and the People Who Author It.</h2>


<P>It was Winston Churchill in his July 8th, 1920 House of Commons speech
condemning General Dyer's role in the 1919 Amritsar Massacre
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#1">(1)</a> who noted
that "it was compassion and its absence which marked the difference between
Englishmen and Bolsheviks"
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#2">(2);</a>
 just as it could be said that is it software
and its absence, that marks the difference between being able to perform and
not to perform modern crystallography.  Modern crystallographic software is
fundamental to present routine structure determination and the continuation
of crystallography as a dynamic science.  If new or updated computer
algorithms are unavailable in a readily useable form, new areas of
crystallography grind down to a snail's pace .  It can be argued that lack
of new, "available" algorithms is affecting to a great extent the
possibility of routinely using powder diffraction data for ab-initio
structure solution
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#3">(3)</a>
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#4"> (4).</a>
  Structure solution from powder diffraction data
does not come easy compare to single crystal diffraction; where readily
available structure solving programs such as Shelxs
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#5">(5)</a>, Patsee
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#6">(6),</a> Sir
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#7">(7)</a>
and Dirdif
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#8">(8)</a>
 are well adapted to a wide range of single crystal systems. 

<P>
A present threat and disincentive to the development of leading edge
academic crystallographic software in Britain is the indifference this
arduous research activity encounters in performance reviews.  It is
difficult to imagine any sound logic or rationale that denies academic
software developers full and proper acknowledgment for their research and
work, especially when it also holds such major benefits to the scientific
community.  Modern crystallography and crystallographers are reliant on
those who undertake intellectually challenging and demanding research
endeavours to develop useable, practical algorithms and software.  This is
but a one issue, though the major one, revolving around the field of new
cutting edge crystallographic software development.

<P> A not uncommon utterance is that many "new" algorithmic techniques have
apparently re-invented the wheel, "supposedly" replicating work performed
before in some form or another
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#9">(9) </a>
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#10">(10). </a>
 However, one must respect that many
of these "supposed" re-inventions of the wheel differ greatly from their
predecessors by having crossed over the bridge into being a practical
scientific method incorporated into useable software.   Contrast this with
the algorithmic methods published in the literature that have yet not
crossed the bridge between "not science" and "science".  It is open,
routine, continuous and ever present validation of software, and its absence
that marks the difference between what is scientific software, and what is
not.  This is not to infer or imply that many of these developing, but
unrealised methods published in the literature are not exciting and
"cracking hot stuff".  However, in the spirit of the Royal Society's motto
of "Nullius in verba"
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#11">(11)</a>,
 the scientific method involves never ending,
routine validation and testing.  Software and algorithms that are not openly
accessible circumvents what is a basic requirement for "scientific
software"; its availability for routine validation through continuous and
open usage.

<P> Of many exciting claims have been made in the literature over new
crystallographic algorithms, some include "routine" methods for solving
molecular structures from powder diffraction data.  In the spirit of
extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence, the Internet means
there is no technical obstacle in making new algorithms and software
available to put through the rigours of falsification and testing.  Indeed a
quality measure of a scientific claim or theory is how much effort the
authors have gone through to make their work as easily understandable,
testable and verifiable as possible.  Le Bail extraction is a notable
example in powder diffraction where effort was undertaken by its creator,
Armel Le Bail, to provide relevant information to the scientific community,
such that it could be openly applied and tested in a time effective
manner
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#12">(12).</a>
  It is the open availability of the Le Bail extraction in a
variety of freely available software packages that has helped enable the
"relative explosion" in the number of ab-initio structure solutions from
powder diffraction data.

<P> Another trend in academic software development is the push to
commercialise in the hope of realising extra sources of external income.  As
this can lock new, innovative software away from the bulk of
crystallographers, it should be noted that strategies exist that allow both
options of commercialised software that is still freely available to
academics
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#7">(7)</a>
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#5"> (5).</a>
  There are obvious advantages of providing freely
available software to academics.  These includes enabling a critical mass of
users and testers and obtaining a dynamic resource pool of new ideas to keep
the software ahead of rivals.  If necessary, providing compiled binaries can
protect the integrity of the source code.  Many, if not most users of
crystallographic software prefer ready to use binary executables instead of
source code.  Is it also just coincidence that some of the most respected
names in crystallography also supply freely available "benchmark" software
for academics?

<P> Despite the above statements of gloom, there is still excellent software
being authored and freely distributed by British academics.  Programs
include the Crystals Single Crystal Suite
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#13">(13); </a>
WinGX<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#7">(14)</a> and GX
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#7">(15)</a> single
crystal suites; PROFIL Powder Diffraction Suite
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#16">(16);</a> CRYS2RUN Powder
Indexing Suite
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#17">(17);</a> UNITCELL powder cell refinement
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#18">(18);</a> XHYDEX for locating
hydrogens
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#19">(19)</a>;
 CRUSH for modelling Polyhedra Frameworks
<a href="../../ed/progs/dec98.html#20">(20)</a>, etc.  Though it
is debateable how long even this can continue when the pivotal role of
academic software development is not appropriately acknowledged by existing
research review processes.

<P> What is to be the future?  Science does not doddle on in a linear and
predictable fashion.  Who is to know what developments may render
diffraction based crystallography hopelessly obsolete in the future? 
However, for the present, crystallography needs a continuing stream of
modern software and algorithms to cope with more difficult and challenging
scientific problems.  Current trends could imply that progress will not be
limited by availability of crystallographic data; but the ability to analyse
the majority of this data in a routine manner.  This will most likely be
mainly due to the current disincentive to develop new algorithms and
software, convoluted with the non-availability of what has already been
published in the scientific literature.
