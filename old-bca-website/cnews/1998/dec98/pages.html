<h2>From the President and the Treasurer</h2>
<HR>
<h3>A Guide to IUCr Subscriptions, the Royal Society and the BCA</h3>

 <P>
<P>
<strong>The Current Position</strong>
<P>
Until 1999, the Royal Society has been the UK adhering body to the
International Union of Crystallography. It has paid 100% of the UK
subscription for category 5 IUCr membership, but since 1996 has invoiced the
BCA for the difference between the category 5 and category 4 subscriptions,
because the Royal Society believes we should only be category 4 members
(their stated policy for all scientific unions is that as far as practical
we should be in a category below the Americans, and on a par with Germany
and France). The amount of this difference is &pound;2200. Thus the BCA has
paid &pound;2200 in each of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 and will do so
again in 1999, in order to maintain category 5 IUCr membership.<BR>

<P>
<strong>What has changed?<BR></strong>The Royal Society has now made decisions:
<P>
<strong>(a)</strong> to cease being the adhering body on
<strong><em>most</em></strong> scientific unions where there is an
appropriate UK society as of 1999/2000, allowing the national association -
meaning the BCA in our case - to take over. We welcome this.

<P>
<strong>(b)</strong> to only pay 49% of the annual subscription for the
category they think we should be from 2000. Their stated reasoning behind
this is that they no longer wish to have a "controlling interest" in the
societies' international interactions, and want to encourage the societies
to have more involvement through their increased financial ownership of
international participation.

<P>
<strong>What does this mean for the BCA ?</strong>

<P>
Decision (a) is easy - the necessary procedures are under way. In future,
the BCA will pay the IUCr annual subscription direct, and will invoice the
Royal Society for their contribution. Decision (b) means that the BCA has a
decision of its own to make.

<P>
<strong><em>Alternative A</em></strong> - take up adherence at category 4.
This would mean that our total annual IUCr subscription would be
&pound;4400. The Royal Society thinks we should be category 4, and so would
pay half of this, i.e. &pound;2200. Thus our liability would be &pound;2200
annually, the same as has been the case from 1996 onwards.

<P>
<strong><em>Alternative B</em></strong> -  take up adherence to the IUCr at
category 5, maintaining the current level. The US is category 5; the French
and Germans are category 4. This would mean that our total annual IUCr
subscription would be &pound;6600. The Royal Society thinks we should be
category 4, so will still only pay &pound;2200. Thus our liability would be
&pound;4400 annually, an increase of &pound;2200 over recent years.

<P>
The BCA Council has decided that we should <strong>maintain category 5 
membership</strong>. <BR>The reasons for this are as follows:

<P>
1. 	If we go to category 4, this will leave the USA alone as category 5.
What this means effectively is that at the General Assemblies of the IUCr,
the BCA would have one less vote in decisions than the USA. The BCA Council
considers that given the fact that the BCA is the second largest national
crystallography association in the world, it is important to maintain our
influence in IUCr matters. While we have no fear that the USA
representatives would use their extra power to our detriment, we do
nevertheless consider that it would be wrong to leave the majority power in
one single country. It should also be borne in mind that at present
crystallography in the USA is very heavily weighted towards biology, and so
this may not represent the same interests as our broader community in the
UK.

<P>
2. 	The UK has a long and proud tradition of crystallography, right back to
the beginning. This has often culminated in a relatively large number of
Nobel prizes and many other accolades for UK based crystallography. The
opinions of the UK in crystallographic matters are highly respected
throughout the world. Next year the UK will be hosting one of the major
scientific events of the year -- the Glasgow IUCr Congress. Crystallography
in the UK is very much alive and vibrant (witness the turn-out for our BCA
Meetings), and we believe that ours is an image of progress for the future.
Council is concerned that by dropping to category 4 the wrong sort of
message would be sent out to the scientific community at large, and perhaps
more importantly to the Government and its agencies. This applies equally to
science in general rather than to crystallography alone.

<p align=left>
Passing a blue plaque on the wall of a house at No. 9 Fitzroy Street, London
W1, inscribed to the memory of A. W. Hofmann (l8I8 - 1892), Professor of
Chemistry, led me to look up Hofmann in the classic Encyclopedia Britannica
of 1910, and this started a chain of thought.
<p>
There is an unsigned article redo lent with biblical strictures (Acts 18:17)
on the apathy for chemistry which Hofmann experienced: "In England. however,
people cared for none of these things, and were blind to the commercial
potentialities of scientific research" - although BASF had synthesized
indigo and ruined the indigo industry of the British Empire. The
corresponding retribution was visited on Britain when, in the 1914-1918 war,
German chemistry provided better explosives, but the synthetic production of
acetone by Chaim Weizmann saved the day and influenced the Balfour
Declaration, so that Israel at its 50th anniversary should remember the
acetone molecules made by its first president.
<p>
It is said that a student came up to J. D. Bernal after a lecture and
explained that he had found the lecture so enthralling that he had been
unable to take notes, so could he borrow the lecturer's notes? Bernal
sheepishly produced an old envelope with three almost illegible words on
it. Accordingly, I quote the following only from memory of a lecture
bearing on the theme of German chemistry.
<p>
The First World War had shown, among other things, how superior the Germans
were in organic chemistry so that after the war the British government
imposed a duty on organic chemicals to encourage the British chemical
industry. Calcium carbide was imported from Norway, where it was made with
hydroelectric power and was widely used for making acetylene for welding and
for bicycle lamps - at school we used to disrupt classes by dropping calcium
carbide into the ink wells  - but calcium carbide was classed as an organic
chemical and thus attracted import duty.
<p>
The Norwegian government contested this decision, and a court was asked to
rule on whether calcium carbide was organic or inorganic. The British
government called a senior organic chemist as its expert witness. and the
Norwegian government appointed the young mineralogical professor V. M.
Goldschmidt (1888- 1947). Goldschmidt was unequal when it came to organic
chemistry so he asked W. L. Bragg to find the crystal structure of calcium
carbide. Bragg did this very quickly and not altogether satisfactorily, but
it was clear that the structure was that typical of all inorganic salt. With
the modern crystallography, Goldschmidt was able to tie up the organic
chemist in cross-questioning, and the court finally ruled that calcium
carbide was inorganic and thus exempt from tax.
<p>
A grateful Norwegian government then gave Goldschmidt a small amount of
money to set up in X-ray crystallography. He could not compete with Bragg,
who was then solving very complex silicates, so he set to work to measure
the cell dimensions of as many simple binary crystals as he could find. From
this he constructed the tables of ionic radii which are still in use!

<em>Editor's Note:</em> I am grateful to Alan for sending me this copy of an
article which first appeared in <em>'The Chemical Intelligencer'</em> in October
1998, and to the editor of that journal, Istvan Hargittai, for permission to
reproduce it here.

<h2>EDITORIAL</h2>
<h3>Invitation to contribute to Special Issue on Software for March 99 <BR>
 miscellaneous news items</h3>
<HR>
<P>
The December and March issues of 'Crystallography News' normally contain
many pages devoted to plans for the Annual BCA Spring meeting to be held the
next Easter.  Since we are organising IUCr99 in August there will be no
Spring meeting in 1999, so there was space in this issue to print some more
general articles such as a '<em>Letter to the Editor</em>' from Lachlan
Cranswick. He raises an important point about software. <strong>I am inviting
academic software authors to describe their products in the next issue,
March 1999</B>, deadline 6th February.</strong>
 Contributions should not exceed one
A4 page when printed; remember that the newsletter is reduced in size to A5
and printed in black and white; text should be printed in a font 12 point or
more. Commercial software vendors are welcome to join in by taking out an
advertisement.  Contributions should state hardware and system requirements
and what aspect of crystallography the program covers, such as structure
determination, simulations, molecular diagram drawing, teaching, etc. David
Watkin (Oxford) has taken the opportunity to describe the 'CRYSTALS32' program
a little later in this issue. 
 

<P>
<strong>Editor's Archive - needs chemistry? and lacks pictures!</h2>
<p>I now have
copies of all the current series of BCA Newsletters in the 'Editor's
Archive' and most of those issued by the Institute of Physics(IOP), X-Ray
Analysis Group. (there are a few missing ones issued between 1957 and 1979,
they are No.s 3, 9,16, 22, 58 ).  
<BR>A chemist friend pointed out that the
BCA was formed by merging a group from the RSC with one from the IOP, so
there may be older newsletters issued by the <strong>Chemical</strong> 
Crystallography
Group of the RSC before 1982.  I would be grateful for any information
relating to these newsletters and for donations of spare copies to the
'Editor's Archive'.

<P>
From time to time I am approached by people who want a photograph
to illustrate the book they are writing about crystallography; they usually
ask for pictures of people but sometimes want molecular diagrams or old
equipment.  I am planning to collect an <em>'Editor's Archive'</em>
 of photographs
and would be most grateful for copies of any you may be able to donate,
preferably annotated with the date and place where they are taken with a
caption naming any people. I would also be grateful for the address of any
similar archives where I can find pictures when my own resources fail.


<P>
<strong>Information wanted about a crystallographer.<BR></strong
>One problem with the
archive is that it begins in 1957. I was recently asked for information
about an <strong>H.T.Flather, </strong> 
described as a <em>crystallographer</em>, who
was living in Blackheath, London in 1949. He made beautiful polyhedral
models, exhibited at Mathematical Association meetings.  Does any one know
what crystallography he did? Or where he worked?

<P>
<h3>SAXS beyond the research lab</h3>
<P>
SAX/SWAX techniques bear considerable potential as tools for in-line
industrial process monitoring wherever nanostructure counts for product
quality. Fields of interest are: LC-plastics, microporous ceramics,
zeolites, detergents, oils, fats, pharmaceuticals and many others. Details
on 'EUROSAX' are on the Web at 
<a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ibr/xray.html">
http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ibr/xray.html</a>

<P>
<strong>Peter Laggner</strong> wants to set up a Forum for SAXS at  SAS99
and is looking for interested colleagues. Please contact him by  e-mail:
