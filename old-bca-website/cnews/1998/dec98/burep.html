<h2>Report on AsCa98 Conference in Malaysia</h2>
<HR>
<P>
The 3rd Conference of the Asian Crystallographic Association (ASCA'98) was
held during 13th-15th October in the Hotel Equatorial, Bangi near Kuala
Lumpur in Malaysia. 

<P>
The scientific highlights of the conference were the four excellent plenary
lectures and the IUCr 50th Anniversary symposium.  In addition to the above,
14 microsymposia covered a range of topics from diffraction theory to
protein crystallography.  Biological, chemical and physical crystallography
were all well represented.  Lively poster sessions, held each afternoon,
provided plenty of time for participants to discuss their findings. 
Attendance at the sessions was always excellent, with standing room only
during certain microsymposia held on the final day.

<P>
The social program began with an evening poolside reception and even a heavy
tropical downpour failed to dampen the great atmosphere.  The highlight of
the social program was without doubt the eight course Chinese dinner,
complete with traditional Malaysian music and dancing.  The dinner had been
opened in spectacular style by piper Inderjit Singh, who led in Chris
Gilmore, Chick Wilson and Kenneth Shankland (all in kilts, of course) to the
strains of 'Scotland the Brave&#146;.  Chris assured all AsCA participants
of a warm  welcome in Glasgow for IUCr 1999.

<P>
The conference bore all the hallmarks of a very well organised meeting, with
much of the credit going to Prof. A. Hamid Othman, chair of the local
organising committee.  Likewise, the programme committee deserve great
credit  for putting together such a well balanced scientific programme.

<h2>Bursary Report - XIIth International Conference on Crystal Growth</h2>
<HR>
<P>
      This triennial International Conference on Crystal Growth was held in
Jerusalem, Israel in July 1998. This was my first conference; I was very
impressed by the huge number of delegates participating, about 900. There
were 5 parallel oral sessions on each of 5 days Morning sessions began with
a 45 minute plenary lecture from a renowned expert. I was particularly
impressed by the interesting and entertaining description by the Nobel prize
winning, Sir Harold Kroto of his group's work on the science of
buckminsterfullerene. He described his discovery of this new form of carbon
and went on to explain new applications of nanotechnology.
Buckminsterfullerene can arrange itself in the form of very strong tubes
which can be used to strengthen other materials. His group has discovered
ways of using catalytic control of nanotube construction. He also expressed
delight in the increased public awareness of the benefits of science. The
public definition of a "chemical" is largely negative, with bad associations
with pollution, pesticides and nuclear disasters. Sir Harold believes that
interest in the C<SUB>60</SUB> molecule, which is aesthetically pleasing and
widely discussed in the public arena has helped to dispel the myth that
<em>all </em>chemicals are bad.

<P>
      The sessions I found most interesting included those on <em>surfaces
and interfaces, templated crystallisation, industrial
crystallisation and crystallisation phenomena in foods,
pharmaceuticals and bio-related materials. </em>I work on additive mediated
wax crystallisation, and would eventually like to extend my knowledge to the
area of pharmaceutical crystallisation, so there were many relevant talks.
One of the first lectures was given by M. Plomp from The University of
Nijmegen. He monitors crystal morphologies at surfaces using atomic force
microscopy. I was interested to find that he had examined n-alkanes
crystallised from solution and observed monosteps in equidistant trains. In
the session  "Templated Crystallisation" my colleague, Carol Peacock, spoke
on the applications of NEXAFS spectroscopy (Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine
Structure), and I was pleased to find that work carried out by S.A. Safran
(Weizmann Institute) supported results obtained using NEXAFS on the surface
freezing of n-alkanes.

<P>
    Bridgid Heywood (Keele University) gave perhaps the "best talk" in the
conference. She described attempts to mimic the crystallisation processes
used in nature. We were fascinated by the description of how the slow
release of pharmaceuticals into the body can be facilitated using dendrimers
based on calcium carbonate. Her group plan to crystallise calcium carbonate
to make more natural prosthetic limbs.

<P>
    I gave a poster during the first of the two poster sessions held during
the conference. The title of my poster was "Additive Mediated Wax Deposition
in Pipeline Environments: a Structuro-Kinetic Perspective". It detailed the
apparatus I have built and some of the results I have obtained in my
attempts to understand the bulk and surface nucleation of wax with and
without the presence of inhibitors. With approximately 140 posters in each
session, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that I spent the entire
afternoon explaining my work to the many delegates who showed an interest. I
received a lot of feedback and am especially grateful to Tjakko Zijlema from
the Delft University of Technology who has since posted me very useful
information.

<P>
     The conference was a very valuable experience academically, and
spending a week in Jerusalem was a chance in a lifetime experience. I loved
the Old City, and was very moved by the religious sites.  I thank the BCA
for their monetary contribution which enabled me to attend this conference.
