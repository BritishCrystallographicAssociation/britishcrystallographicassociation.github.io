<h2>1998 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE B.C.A.</h2>

  <DD>Dr Frank Allen
 <DT>Secretary
  <DD>Dr Hilary Muirhead

  <DD>Professor Judith Howard (Scientific Unions Committee, Royal Society)
</DL>
<P>
The Council has met twice during the year: during the Spring Meeting in
Leeds and at Birkbeck College, London in October. At the Leeds meeting the
present Vice-President took over from Professor Bruce Forsyth and the
present Secretary succeeded Dr Moreton Moore. Both Bruce and Moreton were
heartily thanked for all their hard work for the BCA. Dr Sam Small has stood
down after many years as the BCA representative on the Bragg Lecture Fund
Committee. Professor Paul Barnes has been appointed as the new
representative.

<P>
During 1997, four excellent quarterly issues of Crystallography News were
published. The coloured covers are very attractive and the Newsletter has
published full accounts of all the events mentioned in this report. The
Council thanks the Editor for her efforts in compiling the Newsletter, as
well as for the substantial advertisement revenue generated. Kate Crennell
also maintains the BCA page on the Internet.

<P>
Now that the Chemical Crystallography Group is running independently of the
Royal Society of Chemistry it needs a new constitution. The proposed
constitution, which is published in this issue of Crystallography News, will
come to the AGM for adoption.

<P>
The Annual Spring Meeting at Leeds, the home of some famous
crystallographers, was a great success, although sponsorship was
disappointing, and the activities of the various Groups have been reported
on, in detail, in the June Issue of Crystallography News. The scientific
content was of a high standard and the conference facilities were first
class. There were three named lectures - the Hodgkin lecture given by
Professor Michael Woolfson, the Lonsdale Lecture given by Professor Andrew
Lang and the Bragg Lecture given by Professor Durward Cruickshank. The
Council would wish to thank the local organisers, and all their helpers,
seen and unseen for all their hard work. Special thanks go to Dr Mark
Thornton-Pett. 

<P>
During the year there were several meetings and workshops. All four groups
have held meetings, including ones on from genes to crystals (Leicester),
disorder, twinning and incommensurate structures (Bristol), the use of X-ray
diffraction in industrial problem solving (Cranfield) and structural physics
(Exeter). The Industrial Crystallography Group has organised a number of
small, special interest meetings and workshops.

<P>
A successful sixth Intensive Course in X-ray Structure Analysis  was held in
Durham (6-14 April, 1997). It took place in a new venue and was the first to
be run without the participation of David Watkin, who played an enormous
role in the design and development of the course.

<P>
Membership is healthy and many young crystallographers have received BCA
bursaries to attend meetings and conferences, both in the UK and worldwide.
Frank Allen represented the BCA at the inaugural meeting of the European
Crystallographic Association (ECA) in August. Frank was elected to the ECA
Council, which will be responsible for European Crystallographic Meetings.

<P>
Some good friends and colleagues have died during the year, including Sir
John Kendrew and Peter Wheatley. Appreciations have appeared in
Crystallography News.

<P>
We are looking forward to another successful Spring Meeting, this time
organised by Dr Phil Lightfoot at St Andrews. An innovation here is the BCA
Plenary Session (on Disorder) which will draw speakers from each of the
BCA's constituent groups. There will be no Spring Meeting in 1999 as that
will be the year of the IUCr Congress in Glasgow. We wish Dr Chris Gilmore
and his team every success in arranging the Glasgow meeting. As well as the
main congress there will be a number of satellite meetings.

<h2>Proposed minor changes to the By-Laws<br>
 of the British Crystallographic Association</h2>
<HR>
<p>
The complete <a href="../../admin/stbyl.html">Statutes and By-Laws</a>
were published on page 10 of 'Crystallography News' March 1996 issue no. 56.
The following changes are proposed.  
<P>
1. Delete By-Law D4<BR>
<strong>D.  General Meetings.<BR>
4.</strong> The examined accounts shall be despatched to Members at least
two weeks before the date of the Annual General Meeting, preferably with the
agenda paper.<BR><BR>

2. Replace <strong><U>two</U></strong> days by 
<strong><U>seven</U></strong> days in By-Law E2<BR>

<strong>E.  Nominations and Elections<BR>
2.</strong> Any two Members may make nominations for any vacancy. Such
nominations shall be accompanied by the written consent of the candidate to
serve if elected, and must be received by the Secretary not less than
<strong><U>two days</U></strong> before the Annual General
Meeting.<BR><BR>

<strong>Proposed changes in the Statutes to be discussed at the
AGM.</strong>

<P>
<strong>E2</strong>.  
The Council shall consist of the following:-<BR>
<em>Add:</em> The Immediate Past President should be a Member of Council 
<em>ex officio </em>for one year.
<P>
<strong>E3</strong>. Each elected Member of Council shall serve from the end
of the Annual General Meeting at which the election took place until the end
of the second Annual General Meeting following the election. No person may
serve more than two consecutive terms in the same office, nor more than four
consecutive terms in any combination of offices.

<P>
Council proposes that the standard term of office should be three years
instead of the current two years with a maximum of four years.

<h2>The BCA WEB Site has moved </h2>
<HR>
<P>
The BCA Web site has moved to a different Internet server at Birkbeck in an
attempt to provide an improved service to readers. The old Web site will
remain for a few months but will no longer be updated.  At the same time I
have re-organised the files into a more sensible directory structure.  <BR>

<P>
I am trying to provide an index to the back issues of 'Crystallography News' 
and to make the text of the recent  ones readable on the site. All the book
and software reviews are already updated and so are the obituaries and news
of members. I have tried to keep the site as simple as possible to  give a
fast network response.  Comments are welcome at any time, preferably via
email to BCA@isise.rl.ac.uk
