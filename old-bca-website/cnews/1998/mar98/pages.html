<h2>The Amazing Dorothy Hodgkin</h2>
</center>
<HR>
<P>
   The Oxford International Women's Collective are organising a meeting in
the University Museum on 10th March 1998 where Judith Howard and other
friends and colleagues of Dorothy will talk about aspects of her life as
scientist, peace campaigner and mother.

<P>
   At the meeting they plan to launch a fund to create a permanent memorial
to Dorothy in the Oxford area where she carried out her research; this may
be a statue or a bust of Dorothy, they have not yet decided the exact form. 
In collaboration with the Oxford branch of AWISE (see later article) they
are also considering funding an annual 'Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Lecture',
to be presented in Oxford by a leading woman scientist. They hope the first
lecture will be given in 1999 as part of the Oxford International Women's
Festival.<BR>

<BR>
   <B><I> BCA members are invited to send comments to the editor, who will
pass them on to the organising committee.  Do you think Dorothy would have
wanted a statue?</I></B>

<H2>Cover Story</h2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src="covr2.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE alt="St.Andrews Univ">
<BR>
<p align=left>
The front cover is a view familiar to many generations of golf lovers, 
the old Club House at the Royal and Ancient Golf Course, in St.Andrews.
<BR><BR>The photograph on the left shows a more academic view of the 
University of St.Andrews, taken by Steve Maginn, who kindly looked through
 his collection to find an attractive view to encourage you to come to the 
BCA meeting in St.Andrews.

<h2>From the President</h2>


<P>
It's that time of year again, when the BCA Spring Meeting approaches. This
year will be the last Spring Meeting for two years, since we shall not be
holding one in 1999, the year of the IUCr Meeting in Glasgow. 

<P>
St. Andrews promises to be a most interesting venue, not just because of the
golf possibilities, and I encourage you to make the effort to attend. We are
going to try a couple of new ideas during this meeting. I have been long
concerned by the fractionation of our subject into its membership groups,
with a tendency for people only to attend those sessions of immediate
interest to themselves. I feel strongly that there should be some areas of
common interest to all. Consequently, this year we shall devote one session
to a joint gathering of all the groups, in which there will be a speaker
from each discipline. Details can be found on page 14. The second change is
that we shall try a "Question Time" session. Participants will be asked to
submit a question and a selection of these will be discussed during this
session. I hope that everyone will attend and join in giving your opinions!
I have seen this work very well in one of the group meetings, and there is
no reason why we cannot apply this to the BCA as a whole. 

<P>
I note from our web site that congratulations are due to two of our members.
First of all Malcolm McMahon has received the award of two prestigious
prizes: the EPDIC Award for 1997 for outstanding scientific contribution in
the field of powder diffraction, and an award for outstanding research by a
young scientist working at a European synchrotron. This follows his success
in gaining a Royal Society award in 1996. Is there no stopping this man? 
Secondly, it is my pleasure once again to congratulate Lesley Dent Glasser,
this time on winning the Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and Prize for
1998. 

<P>
See you all in St. Andrews.

 <BR><strong>THE TED MASLEN BURSARY AWARD</strong><BR>
<P>
<hr>
One of the above bursaries has been designated the Ted Maslen Bursary Award,
in memory of the late <strong>Ted Maslen of the University of Western
Australia.</strong> Ted was a BCA member, and had just paid advance
membership at the time of his death. With the kind permission of his widow,
Sheila, the BCA has put this money towards a designated award for this year
only, to an applicant whose poster submission represents the most recent
area of Ted's work - charge density studies.  The Ted Maslen Bursary Award
has been made to <strong>Slimane Dahaoui</strong>, of the Universit&eacute;
Henri Poincare at Nancy, France, currently working at the University of
Durham. His poster is entitled "Structure and Charge Density Studies at 110K
of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine Ethyl Ester Monohydrate".

<h2>CLRC News - Awards for Malcolm McMahon</h2>
Congratulations to our IUCr99 logo designer, Malcolm McMahon, on the recent
award of two prestigious prizes.  Malcolm is shown with some of the high
pressure equipment at the Daresbury Laboratory in the photograph on the
right which first appeared in the CLRC 'LabNews' for January 1998. I am
grateful to the CLRC for permission to reprint it here.<BR>
<BR>In May at the EDPDIC-97 conference held in Parma, Italy, he received the
'EPDIC Award 1997' and presented the opening paper of the Conference
describing his work. The citation for the prize was for 'outstanding
scientific contribution in the field of powder diffraction'.

<P ALIGN=Center><IMG src="mmahon.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE Alt="McMahon in DL"></p>
<P>
Prof. Malcolm Cooper, University of Warwick, of the European Synchrotron
Radiation Society, (ESRS), recently sent me the following news item.

<P>
To mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of synchrotron radiation the
ESRS has awarded a prize of 1500 ecu (about &pound;1000) for outstanding
research by a young scientist working at a European synchrotron. The prize
was to be awarded for work done since 1994 by someone under 35.

<P>
The winner was Malcolm McMahon, who is based at the Daresbury Laboratory. He
has made a significant contribution to the study of materials at high
pressures. It is a perfect example of how innovative experimental technique
transforms into new science. Together with Professor Richard Nelmes he has
cleverly exploited the advantages of image plate detectors and applying the
Rietveld refinement technique. They have moved this area of work forward and
away from the limitations that were imposed by the energy dispersive
technique. Exciting results have been obtained at both Daresbury and the ESRF
on the high pressure structures of InSb, Si, Ge, HgSc, and a host of
materials. In an impressive array of publications, they reported new and
unexpected structural complexities and settled what were old standing
problems.

<P>
The prize was awarded in November 1997 at the International Conference on
Highlights in Synchrotron Radiation Research held in Grenoble, France, where
Malcolm gave an invited talk on his work.

<strong>New value in old science books</strong>
<P>
A plea for unwanted science books comes from John Lawson, who retired from
RAL ten years ago and Ron Newport, who recently retired from Daresbury. 
They work as voluntary helpers at the OXFAM bookshop in Oxford and are
looking for any old science books. Whatever their age, they are all
saleable. Contact John on (01235) 521516 or Ron on (01235) 848424 to arrange
collection if you live in the Oxford area. Otherwise contact your local
OXFAM branch. OXFAM also operate a book search service between their shops.
