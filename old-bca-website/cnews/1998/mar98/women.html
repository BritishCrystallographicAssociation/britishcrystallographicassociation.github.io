<P align=left>
The UK Government and the EU are now doing more to encourage women to work
in science and technology. This section contains news of several recent
projects :

Cracking It!<br>Helping Women to Succeed in Science, 
Engineering and Technology</h2>
 
<P>
Ways for women to break through the glass ceiling in traditionally male
dominated professions are outlined in a recently published handbook.
"Cracking It!" is full of practical tips and realistic strategies for women
working in the field of science, engineering and technology.  It is based on
the experiences of those who have succeeded.  Speaking at the launch in
London, the President of the Board of Trade, Margaret Beckett said:

<P>
<em>"I welcome this book particularly as the Cabinet Minister with
responsibility for Science, because I think it will do much to support,
encourage and retain women working in these areas.  The fact that women are
still under-represented in these sectors does not help our competitiveness. 
We need to promote a balanced workforce to ensure that the talents that
women can provide are utilised to the full.  I see this book as providing a
valuable contribution towards that aim."</em> <P>
 
<P>
 "Cracking It!" (ISBN 1 840190000) has 220 pages. It was written by Josephine 
Warrior and costs &pound;10.99 + &pound;1.20 postage and packing,  from:

<h2>MINISTER LAUNCHES WEBSITE FOR WOMEN<br>
     http://www.womens-unit.gov.uk</h2>
<HR>
<P>
The new dialogue between women and Government took an important step forward
at the end of October as Harriet Harman, Minister for Women and Social
Security Secretary, launched a new Internet website for women where women
will be able to make an effective contribution to the discussion with
Government on the issues that concern them.

<P>
The new website outlines the roles and objectives of the Minister for Women,
carries details of current announcements and speeches, and allows women to
pass on their views on issues that concern them. Views will also be sought
on a range of specific issues - the first of these being how women meet
their childcare needs. 

<P>
 Responses to the website will be collated by the Women's Unit and passed on
to the Ministers for Women. All responses will be dealt with in confidence,
although a summary will be made public.

<a name="witec"><HR></a>
<P>
<strong>WITEC</strong><br> is a European network of organisations and
individuals working for the motivation, development and support of women in
science, engineering and technology (SET).  In 1996 WITEC produced a
European Handbook of Women Experts in Science, Engineering and Technology.</p>
<p> 
This highlighted the need for an on-line database which could be easily
updated, expanded and accessed.  With support from the EC, WITEC has now
launched this database of Women Experts on the World Wide Web at

<strong>What is AWiSE? <br> http://www.awise.org</strong></p>
<P>
The idea of AWiSE, the Association for Women in Science and Engineering,
arose from the report The Rising Tide (HMSO, 1994), commissioned by the
Office of Science and Technology, on how women's potential could best be
realised in the sciences, engineering and technologies (SET).<BR>

<P>
<strong>Our aims </strong>To advance the participation of girls and women in
the sciences, from biomedicine to mathematics and the social sciences, in
engineering, and in the technologies, in all areas and at all levels, by:

<ul>
  <li> networking and mentoring: sharing information on education, training 
and retraining, and on the job market
  <li> promoting family friendly practices: flexible working, job-sharing, 
good childcare, and keeping in touch on career breaks
  <li> discussions of personal, national and international matters, lobbying
  <li> branch  activities: open lectures, scientific and social meetings, 
     visits, workshops
  <li> fostering the public understanding of science
</ul>
<P>
  The DTI is encouraging professional institutions to use the Web to
organise membership and activities and share information, and we are
developing our Web site to do this. It will include news and views, and
information on careers -  facilities for education, training and retraining,
and the job market, linking with WISDOM (the Wellcome Information Service
Databases on Medicine) and related databases, with the Women Returners
Network (WRN). etc. The Web site will also include interactive personal and
career development programs (PDP) tailored for women on the Web.  We also
publish a quarterly (paper) newsletter for those who support our aims, but
prefer not to use the Web.

<h2>Institute of Physics award for a BCA Founder member</h2>
<HR>
<P>
The January 1998 issue of 'Physics World' contained news of the 1998 Institute of Physics awards, one of which was awarded to one of the BCA Founder members, Lesley Dent Glasser. The citation reads in part:

<P>
<strong>Lesley Glasser</strong>, director of SATRO North Scotland at the
University of Aberdeen, wins the <strong>Kelvin medal and prize</strong> for
her outstanding and prolonged contribution to the public understanding of
physics, particularly in Scotland, by the managing of financial, human and
technological; resources required for running SATRO North Scotland and for
organizing several scientific exhibitions and festivals including
<strong>SATROSPHERE</strong>, <strong>Techfest</strong> and <strong>Science
on the Move</strong>.

<P>
 For the last ten years SATRO North Scotland has helped to run extra
curricular activities for school children and promoted the Institute of
Physics schools lecture tour. The team also helped to set up a travelling
hands on exhibition on the theme of light. In 1988 she set up SATROSPHERE, a
hands on science centre in Aberdeen which now attracts 50,000 visitors a
year. It has become one of the most imaginative and entrepreneurial of the
UK Science Centres. Five years later she helped to establish TechFest,
Aberdeen's annual science and technology festival. In 1995 she formed
another touring exhibition Science on the Move; since then she has supported
the formation of <strong><em>'Live Wire'</em></strong> a science drama
company.

<P>
Later in January I received a letter from <em>John Robertson,</em> 
University of Leeds, who writes:
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<em>'There's Life after retirement from Crystallography</em>'
<P>
<em>"Lesley Glasser was an active and well-connected crystallographer in
Aberdeen University; she was the author of a nice introductory text on
crystallography ('Crystallography and its Applications', Van Nostrand 1997 )
which included sections on electron diffraction and the solid state. She was
the main local organiser of the one conference of the X-Ray Analysis Group
(XRAG, of the Institute of Physics, one of the forerunners of the BCA) which
took place in Aberdeen, (memorable , because, owing to the income having
started to exceed the expenses, visibly, during the running of the meeting,
each of the participants were handed back a &pound;1 note, before the
conference closed; nothing like that had ever happened before, or has done
so since.) More seriously Lesley had a period (three years I think) as
Secretary of XRAG, when she took over that post from me. So you see she
really is one of our crystallographic family. However, on taking early
retirement form her post as a Reader in Chemistry in the University of
Aberdeen, she decided to leave crystallography itself, and got involved with
this novel body called SATRO."</em>

<P>
John goes on to suggest I ask her for a short article on what a SATRO is and does... and what her recommendations might be for other retiring crystallographers.

<P>
<em>Editor's Note</em>: Lesley also used to market <strong><em>'Crystpacks',
</em></strong> a teaching
aid consisting of sets of transparent spheres stuck together in layers which
could be fitted together to form crystal structures.  She collaborated on
the production of a computer animated film <strong><em>'Silicates in Solution' </em></strong>projected 
during the IUCr meeting in Hamburg in 1984 and was also responsible for the
design of a set of teaching programs for the BBC micro, <strong><em>'Atomic 
Packing and
Crystal Structure'</em></strong> later marketed by the Institute of Materials,
and translated for the PC.
