Report on the Organic Crystal Chemistry Symposium<BR>
Rydzyna, Poznan, August, 1997</h2>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>The International Symposium on Organic Crystal Chemistry (I.S.O.C.C.),
held at Rydzyna's exquisitely restored chateau in western Poland 17-21
August, 1997, is the l0th in a series begun in 1977 and continued every two
or three years. While earlier meetings concentrated on techniques and
developments in the determination and discussion of crystal structures,
albeit with certain themes highlighted, recent symposia have been more
concerned with the nature of inter-molecular interactions, the prediction
and design of crystals with specific properties, and theoretical
investigations of molecular structure. Thus for the l0th
I.S.O.C.C.,co-sponsored by the I.U.Cr., guest-host interactions in inclusion
compounds, crystal engineering applications of the Chemical Structure
Database (CSD), and models for structure prediction figured largely in the
programme. With Joel Bernstein (Beer-Sheva) as Programme Chair, it was
inevitable that polymorphism and hydrogen bonding would be prominent in the
discussions.

The meeting format is somewhat like that of a rather intensive Gordon or
Biirgenstock Conference, with no concurrent sessions, and with enhanced
opportunities for scientific interaction by the residence in-house (or
in-chateau) of most of the 100 or so participants, about half from Poland
but the remainder spread across a dozen countries. Each day there were about
five 50 min. talks and several shorter ones; discussion in the poster
sessions was stimulated by beer on tap. The strong field of British
contributions straddled the themes of the symposium: Susan Price (London) on
accurate electrostatic models in prediction of molecular structures; Sam
Motherwell (Cambridge) on non-bonding interactions (Isostar) and packing
visualization with the CSD and the Protein Data Bank (PDB); John Osborn
(Bradford) with a commended poster comparing lattice-energy calculations
with sublimation energies as a basis for polymorph prediction; and two from
Chemical Engineering departments, recognising the industrial relevance of
organic crystallography: Kevin Roberts (Edinburgh) on processing speciality
chemicals and Roger Davey (Manchester) on kinetic processes in polymorph
isolation.

In his opening lecture on quantum crystallography, the Honorary Chairman,
Nobel Laureate, Jerome Karle (Washington D.C.), showed how high-quality
crystallographic data can be utilized in a projector-matrix approach (with
fancy manipulation, as he put it) to enhance the information from quantum
mechanics. It was possible to calculate electron density, energy, etc. for
free small molecules such as maleic anhydride or small peptides, and for
fragments of macromolecules. As an illustration of the power of theoretical
methods, Karle also strongly commended the careful electrostatic interaction
calculations by A. Szarecka (Poznan) for 2-hydroxacetamide in the gas phase
and as dimers in solution. Taking what she termed a lowtech. approach to
structure predictions, involving the most (and least) common molecular and
space-group symmetries, Carolyn Brock (Lexington, KY) noted the strong
tendency of ions to occupy <I><U>m</U></I> and T elements and the robustness
of <U>I</U>4 symmetry. Enthalpy differences were likely to determine
ultimately the formation of some cis and trans isomers. Peter Zorky's
(Moscow) extensive surveys with the CSD showed that the spatial arrangement
of molecules in an organic crystal structure is influenced not to much by
close packing as by specific directional intermolecular interactions,
especially hydrogen bonds. Local symmetry is important for orthogonal and
sandwich benzene-ring contacts but not Cl.... Cl.

With a superb array of slides which, allegedly for the benefit of organic
chemists, contrived to incorporate sanitary engineering in crystal
engineering, Christer Aaker&ouml;y (Manhattan, KS) illustrated the diverse
ways in which molecules can orientate and pack to yield novel materials. The
selectivity and directionality of hydrogen bonding, and the sensitivity of
specific molecular interaction to substituent effects, can be exploited to
link chains into a microscopic scaffolding of 2-d motifs and layers. Chains,
tapes and layers may be assembled by hydrogen bonds linking synthons into
supramolecular solids. John MacDonald (Flagstaff, AZ) was able to engineer
organic structures by hydrogen-bonded layer motifs in a series of
imidazolinium carboxylate salts with relatively short C-H <SUP>¼</SUP> 0
hydrogen bonds as well as N-H <SUP>¼</SUP>0 bonds. Elsewhere, discussing
14-atom hydrogen-bonded rings in specific <I>b</I>-foldamer helices of
peptides synthesised from <I>b</I>-aminoacids, Isabella Karle (Washington,
DC) observed that not all the NH groups engage in hydrogen bonds. Tayhas
Palmore (Davis, CA) reported the use of cyclic dipeptides as robust 1-d
synthon tapes, exploiting the sensitivity of hydrogen bonding to the
different functional groups present. Atom force microscopy can illustrate
the morphological consequences of direction-dependent growth rates of the
supramolecular structure of tapes of 2,5-diketopiperazine packed as decks.
Veneta Videnova-Adrabinska (Wroclaw) stressed the continuity between organic
molecular and supramolecular structure and illustrated a design strategy of
symmetry-constrained molecular recognition with urea cocrystals. For Mike
Zaworotko (Halifax, Nova Scotia), crystal engineering meant designing new
classes of hydrogen-bonded solids: organic cocrystals of complementary
components (at least one organic), including chicken-wire grids, diamondoid
networks and ionic honeycomb grids.

Several of the most highly commended (by an international group under
William Duax (Buffalo, NY)) of the 50 or so posters were of inclusion
compounds and host-guest interactions: Anita Coetzee (Cape Town) on kinetics
of desolvation of substituted fluorenylbiphenyl hosts; Katherine Gifford
Nash (Cape Town) on Toda multipedal hosts with host: guest ratios of 1:2 to
1:6; and Maria Gdaniec (Poznan) on cholic acid, a versatile host, for which,
with thiobenzphenone as guest, weak extra reflections hinted at long-range
interchannel communication between guests. In a vigorous talk, Mark
Hollingsworth (Bloomington, IN) reported on the synthesis of ferroelastic
urea inclusion compounds that undergo domain switching under anisotropic
compression.

<P>
Overall, Chair Urszula Rychlewska and Co-chair Maria Gdaniec (Adam
Mickiewicz University, Poznan) are to be congratulated in maintaining the
spirit of the Rydzyna Symposium as organic solid state chemistry continues
to evolve. In inclusion - compound terminology, communication channels were
very evident between hosts and guests and between guests, stimulated
particularly by the comments on most topics of Joel Bernstein and Bill Duax.
As with the 9th ISOCC, it is planned to publish selected papers in a special
issue of <I><U>J.Molec. Structure.</U></I>
