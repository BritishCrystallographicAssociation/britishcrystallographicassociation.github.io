<HR>

Over 200 schools took part in this South East England Crystal growing competition organised by Phil Smith of the Thames Valley Section of the Royal Society of Chemistry with support from the BCA and the BACG. Thanks to industrial sponsorship most of the schools received a Tee shirt printed with the competition logo and a copy of the booklet 'Crystals' published by the Natural History Museum, London.  The photograph shows one of the winning crystals, beautifully clear and well formed. <br>
