<strong><BR>Chemical Crystallography Group Autumn Meeting 1997<BR></strong>
<HR>
<P>
      The 1997 CCG Autumn Meeting was held in the School of Chemistry at the
University of Bristol and was organised and hosted there by
<strong>Professor Guy Orpen </strong>on Wednesday 12th November.

<P>
      An audience of over 60 assembled to hear a series of lectures on the 
subject of "<strong>Disorder, Twinning and Incommensurate
Structures</strong>" and following a welcome by Guy Orpen, these commenced
with one given by <strong>Mike Hursthouse</strong> <em>(Cardiff)
</em>entitled "<strong>The origin of disorder in crystal structures and its
treatment in refinement</strong>".  He provided a definition of 'real
disorder':  "<em>Discontinuities in the lattice repetition of a crystal
structure,  resulting in partial or mixed occupancy of lattice sites in the
crystallographic unit cell</em>." The distinction was drawn between disorder
in molecular and in framework structures.  For the former the following
types were identified: <br>
(a) alternate displacement disorder, which may be
accompanied by marked "thermal motion" and require restraints or constraints
to molecular geometry and to occupancies; <br>
 (b) alternative orientational
disorder often leads to severe correlation and unstable refinement,
necessitating restraints or constraints;<br>
 (c) continuous orientational
disorder is best tackled by acquiring a new set of data at a lower
temperature. <br>
 In framework structures disorder can affect either the guest
atoms or ions in cavities within the framework or the framework itself.  In
the latter case substitution (e.g. Al for Si in aluminosilicates) or partial
occupancy can occur.  A caution was sounded regarding "virtual disorder",
where the "disorder" arises from an incorrect definition of the lattice or
the choice of the wrong space group.<BR>

<P>
   <strong>David Watkin</strong> <em>(Oxford)</em> had chosen the reassuring
title "<strong>Twinning -  don't give up - yet</strong>" for his examination
of this phenomenon. He described how twinning involves a specific
relationship between singletons and depending on the exact relationship can
be divided into various types: in merohedral  twins the lattices of the
components exactly coincide, while each component of a non-merohedral twin
generates its own diffraction pattern. Twinning can be detected by a variety
of symptoms including geometric relationships between supposedly independent
unit cell parameters; the assignment of space groups such as
<em><BIG>Pmmm</BIG></em> which exhibit a suspicious lack of translational
symmetry; strange patterns of systematic absences; poor convergence and high
difference Fourier residuals with apparently good data.  Historically, the
move from photography to diffractometry led to a  decrease in the number of
twinned structures reported: the spread of area detectors is beginning to
restore this balance. 

<P>
      After an excellent lunch, the sessions resumed with <strong>Howard
Flack</strong> in the chair and our third speaker, <strong>Mike
Glazer</strong> <em>(Oxford)</em>, spoke on "<strong>Incommensurate
diffraction as an end member of  disorder</strong>", beginning with some
illustrations of the phenomenon.  Using examples such as the structures of
nickel squarate and barium titanate, he showed how two different structural
arrangements A and B could exist within the same  crystal, and how a version
of the structure could contain mistakes, for example arrangement A existing
within a structural motif of B.  Experimentally, incommensurate samples can
give rise to additional, diffuse intensity maxima superimposed on the Bragg
scattering, and  Mike proceeded to demonstrate these effects by using
optical transforms.  Incommensurate   structures represent an intermediate
situation between short-range disorder involving atoms or molecules and the
long-range phenomenon of twinning. 20 Acenaphthalene is ordered at 130 K,
shows molecular overlap at 149 K and adopts an incommensurate structure in
the intervening range.

<P>
      <strong>Chick Wilson</strong> <em>(ISIS)</em> outlined some
"<strong>New approaches to the study and  modelling of disorder</strong>",
including variable temperature techniques, supercell methods and diffuse
scattering. Time-of-flight single crystal diffraction retains three-
dimensional information because of the "time-binning" it uses.  At 5 K, even 
lead shows some diffuse reflection.  In the study of static disorder it is
possible to map trends as a function of  sample conditions and effectively
scan thermodynamic variables.  In a study of the temperature-dependent
behaviour of disordered hydrogen atoms in the benzoic acid dimer, these were
shown to be ordered at 20 K but already extensively disordered by 50 K.  In
another study, hydrogen atoms of torsionally disordered methyl groups show
significant libration even at 100 K.  Full three-dimensional datasets were
acquired at eight temperatures between 20 K and  330 K, and subsequent
analysis demonstrated that even at 20 K there was still some librational
motion.  From such studies it is possible to quantify the zero point motion. 
<BR>Chick described the use of a model-free description of disorder in order
to improve the description of the thermal motions.  Although the method is
computationally intense, it  allows the study of systems such as plastic
crystals where standard methods are not applicable.  Information on local
structure or transient effects can be obtained from the analysis of diffuse
scattering.

<P>
     We then moved on to the short contributions, which were chaired by
<strong>Marjorie Harding.</strong>  The first of was by <strong>Howard Flack
</strong><em>(Geneva) </em>on "<strong>Chirality, polarity, lattice symmetry
and standard uncertainties</strong>".  Howard noted that removing atoms from
the lattice can increase the symmetry.  An flipped atomic arrangement may
not correspond with the original, and new data (collected on a new crystal)
may not correspond to the previously established coordinates.  The symmetry
of multiple cells and subcells can play a role in twinning.  In the absence
of actual twinning, the inversion twinning parameter (the Flack parameter -
definitely a relation!) may be used to determine the absolute structure. 
With chiral materials this amounts to establishing the enantiomorph.  When
the Flack parameter is 0.5, a conglomerate could be present.

<P>
      In a talk entitled "<strong>Novel approaches to difficult data
sets</strong>", a series of views of the nearby Clifton Suspension Bridge
allowed <strong>Friedemann Hahn </strong><em>(Stoe Darmstadt)</em> to
demonstrate the importance of  the viewpoint adopted when processing
information, especially when dealing with X-ray effects which cannot be
handled using a conventional orientation matrix. 2D Indexing and
optimisation are important points, but automatic programs often  fail with
difficult cases.  His conclusion was that graphics are very helpful,
becoming more so with increasing numbers of data.  A program called RECIPE
shows peaks and separates out the lattices of intergrown crystals: it is 
possible to derive two orientation matrices and process a dataset for each
component: these sets can be used separately or  in combination.  Several
examples of the application of this technique were given.

<P>
      <strong>Simon Parsons</strong> <em>(Edinburgh)</em> made the tempting
offer "<strong>Multiple crystals -  buy one, get one free</strong>", and
then outlined how to get the best from it.  The determination of the twin
law is critical for the modelling of merohedral twinning, but non-merohedral
twins are now being reported more commonly since the advent of area
detectors and better indexing routines.  Simon uses the DIRAX program to
suggest the different  orientation matrices for the components in twinned
crystal, and from the relationship between these matrices it is  possible to
derive the twin law.  He describes how supercells can arise, for example in
an orthorhombic cell where<em> <BIG>a  »  1/2 b. </BIG></em> He included
some impressive examples of rather complex but clear derivation of twin
laws.

<P>
      In the final contribution, "<strong>Twinned or disordered?"</strong>
was the question posed by <strong>Aggi Steiner
</strong><em>(Liverpool),</em> who gave the example of the product of the
reaction between Ti(O<SUP>i</SUP>Pr)<SUB>4</SUB> and acetone which after two
days produces colourless needles.  The product is <BR>[Ti<SUB>3</SUB>O(
<em>m</em>
-O<SUP>i</SUP>Pr)<SUB>3</SUB>(O<SUP>i</SUP>Pr)<SUB>4</SUB>{Me<SUB>2</SUB>C(O)CH
= C(O)CH<SUB>2</SUB>C(O)Me<SUB>2</SUB>} ], in which three acetone molecules
have trimerised via an aldol-condensation to give the tridentate ligand 
Me<SUB>2</SUB>C(O)CH = C(O)CH<SUB>2</SUB>C(O)Me<SUB>2</SUB>.  The resulting
trititanate complex shows no symmetry at all, but the X-ray data imply the
space group <em><BIG>R-3m</BIG></em>, in which the tridentate ligand is
disordered about the three-fold axis as well as over the three associated
mirror planes. The space group symmetry can be reduced either to
<em><BIG>R-3</BIG></em> (with the loss of the three mirror planes) or to
<em><BIG>C2/m</BIG></em> (with the loss of the three-fold axis). In both
cases the corresponding  twin law has to be  introduced. In case of
<em><BIG>C2/m</BIG></em> this requires rather awkward and time-consuming
matrix transformations both for cell constants and twin law (and worse: in
addition all three mirror planes have to be checked). This can be avoided by
adopting the space group <em><BIG>R-1m</BIG></em>, which is the rhombohedral
setting of <em><BIG>C2/m.</BIG></em> Acceptable models could be refined both
in <em><BIG>R-3</BIG></em> and <em><BIG>R-1m</BIG></em>
(<em><BIG>C2/m</BIG></em>), but these are still disordered in one  way or
the other and represent only a compromise between twinning and disorder.
Aggi is continuing the work using a model involving a non-disordered,
six-component twin in  space group <BR><em><BIG>P-1</BIG></em> (or
<em><BIG>R-1</BIG></em> as it appears in the rhombohedral world).

      The Meeting concluded with a summary by Marjorie Harding which drew
together the various topics discussed during the Meeting and stressing their
growing significance in modern chemical crystallography.  Thanks were
expressed to Guy Orpen and his team for the smooth organisation and running
of the Meeting.
