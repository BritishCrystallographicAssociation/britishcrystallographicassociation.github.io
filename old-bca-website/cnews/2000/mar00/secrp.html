<P>
The Council has met twice during the year: during the IUCr Meeting in
Glasgow and at Birkbeck College, London in October 1999. At the AGM in
Glasgow the Vice-President and the Secretary were re-elected to serve for a
further two years. Mr David Taylor was elected as an Ordinary Member of
Council and there is one vacancy for an Ordinary member of Council. The
changes in the Constitution mean that, from this year's AGM, members of
Council will be elected for three year terms instead of two year terms. At
the Council Meeting Professor Michael Woolfson was co-opted to serve on
Council until 2002.</p>

<P>
In 1999 four excellent quarterly issues of Crystallography News were
published. The coloured covers are very attractive and the Newsletter made a
small profit. The British Library has assigned us an ISSN number for the
newsletter (ISSN 1467-2790). The Newsletter has published full accounts of
all the events mentioned in this report and the Council thanks the Editor
for her efforts in compiling the Newsletter, as well as for the substantial
advertisement revenue generated. Kate Crennell also maintains the BCA
Website on the Internet; a snapshot of the Website in July was copied to the
IUCrXVIII Congress CD-ROM.</p>

<P>
The IUCr Congress in Glasgow was a great success. It was the largest IUCr
Congress ever held with more than 2600 participants. Council would like to
congratulate Chris Gilmore, who ran the local organisation, and Judith
Howard, who produced a scientific programme of high quality and variety.</p> 

<P> During the year there were several meetings and workshops. All four
groups have held meetings, including ones on <EM>'Making and Studying
Protein Complexes'</EM> (University of Oxford), <EM>'Molecular Geometry
using methods Complementary to Crystallography'</EM> (University of
Manchester), <EM>'Industrial Forum'</EM> (Coventry) and <EM>'Pushing the
Limits of Powder Diffraction' </EM> (RAL). 

<P> The Seventh Intensive Course
in <I>X-ray Structure Analysis</I> was held at Durham. This was the largest
school yet with, 83 participants, including many from abroad. The Sixth
Summer School in <I>Protein Crystallography</I> was held in St Andrews. It
is hoped that this school will be run every year with venues alternating 
which will be responsible for European Crystallographic Meetings.</p>
<P>
Membership is healthy and many young crystallographers have received BCA
bursaries to attend meetings and conferences, both in the UK and world-wide.
Frank Allen (with Chick Wilson as alternate) represents the BCA on the
European Crystallographic Association (ECA). Frank is a member of the ECA
Council, which will be responsible for European Crystallographic Meetings.

<P>
We are looking forward to the BCA Spring Meeting at the Edinburgh Conference
Centre, Heriot-Watt University. The Plenary Session is on Refinement and the
local organiser is Georgina Rosair. The next BCA meeting will be at Reading
7-10 April 2001.
