<H2>CLRC News from DL and RAL</h2>

<P>
<STRONG>Professor Brian Eyre</STRONG>, CBE, DSC, FREng takes up 
the Chairmanship of the CCLRC from <BR>
1 April 2000. He has worked in the UKAEA, and been a Professor of Materials
Science at Liverpool University. He has been a member of CCLRC's Council
since 1998; he recently took over Chairmanship of the CCLRC Audit Committee.
He is a Visiting Professor at Oxford University.  (<EM>From the January 2000

<STRONG>Management Changes at Daresbury Laboratory</STRONG><BR> 
The post of Director, Daresbury Laboratory has been re-established, and the
Synchrotron Radiation Department re-organised into two Divisions,  Science
and Accelerator. With effect from 24 January 2000, Dr.Hywel Price became
Director, Daresbury Laboratory while retaining his responsibilities for
Engineering Department; Professor David Norman heads Science Division, Vic
Suller the Accelerator Division, each reports directly to Dr.Price.

<B>News of the new Synchrotron - we expect an announcement any day now</B>
<P>
Although the national media failed to notice that IUCrXVIII in Glasgow was
the largest scientific meeting in Europe last summer, they are beginning to
report the arguments over the location of the proposed new synchrotron
radiation source; sadly there is little mention of the exciting science
which it should enable. 

<P>
Parliamentary Questions have been asked and MEPs have written letters to
<EM>The Times. </EM>  You can read all about this on the Internet;  the
Report of the evidence given to the House of Commons Select Committee for 
Science and Technology by Stephen Byers, Michael Dexter, John Taylor et al.

Report of RAL meeting - "Diffraction with Incident Beam Polarisation on OSIRIS"<BR>
</B>
<HR>
<P>
The long wavelength diffraction component of the OSIRIS project at ISIS has
been constructed and is now operational. The next step is to add incident
beam polarisation and this will be established during this winter.

<P>
We therefore felt it was timely to hold a meeting ( on  30 November 1999 at
RAL) to address the possibilities offered by OSIRIS in the area of neutron
diffraction with polarised incident beams. Our intention in the meeting was
to have experts in the technique describe the possibilities offered by the
new instrument during the morning session, and experts in the scientific
applications describe its potential use during the afternoon. The underlying
aim was to explore the scientific possibilities offered by this new phase of
the instrument, and to identify, alert and listen to the user base. In this
way the instrument will be most likely to be fully utilised when available.

<P>
The workshop kicked off in an upbeat mood with a warm welcome from Dr Uschi
Steigenberger (ISIS), reminding us of the history and development of the
OSIRIS project. Prof. Otto Sch&auml;rpf (Munich Technical University),
followed it with a presentation which reminded us of the essential Blume's
formulae involved in polarised neutron scattering. His theoretical
introduction gave us an insight of the broad avenues that will be available
with<B> </B>OSIRIS when polarisation becomes available to the users. It was
followed by a description of the instrument by its Instrument Scientist, Dr.
Ken Andersen, which touched on the technical aspects, problems, solutions
and possible avenues for the future. Examples from recent experiments showed
the power and uniqueness of the instrument, even before the polarisation
option becomes available. Prof. Otto Sch&auml;rpf closed this morning
session with a second talk. His dissertation on "What is needed
(Instrumentation)" to achieve what Blume's equations offer, gave an
explanation of the elements that are necessary to achieve incident beam
polarisation. He touched in detail the different types of spin-flippers with
its advantages and disadvantages and the necessary corrections and their
importance. Finally Prof. Sch&auml;rpf told us about the common pitfalls
that may occur when working with remanent supermirrors. 

<P>
The afternoon session concentrated on the possible applications of thefrom
the diffraction pattern to obtain the diffuse component. According to Prof.
Harrison, OSIRIS is well positioned to tackle these topics now and specially
when the high resolution at long wavelength is combined with the
polarisation option. This general overview was followed by an exciting talk
on "Diffuse Magnetic Scattering of Polarised Neutrons" by Prof. Bob Cywinski
(St. Andrews). His talk started by giving the reasons to measure the diffuse
scattering. Whilst the elastic scattering can only provide information of
the mean magnetic order within a sample, diffuse scattering gives
information on the spatial variation around this mean magnetic moment and
therefore information on the sensitivity of the magnetic order to the local
atomic environment. Very interesting examples were shown, such as the effect
of defects in ferromagnetic binary alloys. To understand their properties
and to match the advances in computational and theoretical methods, high
quality data will be necessary and in Prof. Cywinski's opinion OSIRIS has a
cons iderable potential for these applications.
 
<P>
The subject of the last presentation was "Spin and Charge Densities" by
Prof. Philip Reynolds (Australian National University). Spin and charge
densities are fundamental quantities, since they are directly connected to
Quantum Mechanics and therefore provide an ideal language for communicating
with theoreticians. In his talk he emphasised the two ways of obtaining
these quantities. "The old way" includes X-ray measurements, polarised
neutron diffraction using large single crystals and neutron diffraction,
while "the new OSIRIS way" involves synchrotron and polarised neutron
diffraction on small amount of powder. He also delved into the exciting
subject of separation of coherent and spin incoherent contributions by using
only incident beam polarisation via polarisation of the nuclei. This would
allow proton mapping in diamagnetic samples, paramagnets and complex
materials; spin mapping of large molecular clusters and the important
removal of the incoherent background in structural determination.

<P>
In summary, this successful workshop led to an extremely powerful exchange of
 ideas between the condensed matter scientists and the instrument scientists
 that is already starting to be fruitful.
