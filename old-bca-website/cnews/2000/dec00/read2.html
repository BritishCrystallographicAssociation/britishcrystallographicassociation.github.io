<B>Spring Meeting 2001<BR>
Industrial Group Sessions</B>
<P>
<B>(1) Basic Powder Diffraction Workshop</B>
<P>
Sunday 8th April, all day - Monday 9th April, am
<P>
This one and a half day course has been constructed with a special concern for the many 
people now working in X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) who are relatively new to the field. 
There are no special pre-requisites for taking part, other than a general technical 
background, but a little hands-on experience of XRPD would help.
<P>
The workshop is divided into three parts:
<P>
<B>Introduction to Crystallography</B><BR>
Jeremy Cockroft, Birkbeck College
<P>
<B>Powder Diffraction Instruments</B><BR>
Judith Shackleton, Manchester Materials Science Centre
<P>
<B>Phase Identification</B><BR>
Ron Jenkins, International Centre for Diffraction Data
<P>

<P>
 <B>(2) Why Industry Uses Crystallography</B>
<P>
Monday 9th April, pm
<P>
Crystallography has wide application in many of our manufacturing industries.
 This session will give a series of overviews of the value that crystallography brings to 
a selection of these industries. While we hope these surveys will be interesting in 
their own right, we also intend that they spark some ideas across traditional industrial 
boundaries.
<P>
Presentations on the following industries are planned:
<P>
<B>Aerospace, Pharmaceuticals, Electronics &amp; Minerals.</B>
<P>
The session will begin with:
<P>
<B>The Alun Bowen Industrial Lecture</B>
<P>
'<B>Crystallography in the Aerospace Industry'</B>
<P>
<B>Colin Small, Rolls Royce</B>

<P>
<B>(3) New &amp; Future Possibilities in Powder Diffraction</B>
<P>
Tuesday 10th April, am
<P>
The programme is being assembled to highlight some aspects of instrumentation and 
methodology in powder diffraction that have seen recent advances or where we should 
expect them in the future. Provisional topics include detectors, combinatorial analysis, 
mirrors and the Rietveld future.

<P>
<B>Industrial Group Posters</B>
<P>
Posters are invited for display at the Spring Meeting. As an extra incentive to your 
participation, in addition to the acclaim that your poster will no doubt bring, 
the Industrial Group is offering a magnificent prize of &pound;50 for best poster.
<P>
Some guidelines follow for what we would prefer to see in our posters and our adjudicators 
will work from these.
<P>
Posters are encouraged that:
<UL>
<LI>are relevant to industry (including some background and value of the work to industry)
<LI>have clear aims, results and conclusions
<LI>concentrate on telling the story, rather than fine detail
<LI>are not an advertisement for a commercial product
</UL>

<P>
There will be an opportunity to give a brief oral presentation of the content of each poster.
<P>

The Philips Analytical Physical Crystallography Award is presented annually
for the best recently published work (say 2-3 papers) by a relatively young
person (usually 35 years of age or younger) working in the field of Physical
Crystallography.  It is to be expected that his or her research has or is
expected to make a significant impact in this field.
The 2001 award will be made during the Annual BCA Spring Meeting at
the University of Reading and the recipient will be expected to give an oral
presentation of his or her work at that meeting.  The committee of the PCG
(also the Structural Condensed Matter Group of the IoP) decide on the
awardee and Philips sponsor the prize, which consists of a cash award plus
expenses for attending the Spring Meeting to deliver the award lecture.  The
Award will be presented by a representative of Philips Analytical.

<P>
Nominations should include a brief CV of the nominee; copies of the papers
on which the nomination is based (on which the main judgement is made) and a
supporting statement from the nominator, including comments on the part the
nominee has played in any research work published jointly with others. 
Nominations of candidates from the same Department as the nominator are not
normally allowed. Optionally, a nomination form is available from the PCG
Secretary (C.C.Wilson@rl.ac.uk) or from the Web at:
<a href="http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/bca/PCG/PhForm.html">
http://bca.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/bca/PCG/PhForm.html</a>.
  
<P>
Nominations for this Award should be sent, by <B>31 January 2001</B>, 
to the Chairman of the Group, Professor J L Finney, FInstP, FRSC, 
Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT 
(email: j.finney@ucl.ac.uk).

<B>PCG Bursaries</B>
<P>
The PCG welcomes bursary applications from BCA or IoP members who are
affiliated to the PCG or to the Structural Condensed Matter Physics Group of
the IoP.  These are intended mainly to help young scientists (students and
post-docs) to attend meetings and conferences relevant to PCG/SCMPG areas of
interest.  Bursaries can be applied for at any time, through the PCG/SCMPG
Secretary (C.C.Wilson@rl.ac.uk) and will be considered by the Group
Committee.  However, each year we expect to target selected meetings as
highly relevant for the award of bursaries.

<P>
A bursary has been awarded to Mr Jim Kelly (Industrial Materials Group, 
Birkbeck College) to help fund his attendance at the CMMP2000 meeting in Bristol, 
19-21 December 2000.
<P>
The next targeted meeting for PCG bursaries will be ECM-20 in Krakow
(bursary applications for the BCA Spring meeting in Reading are expected to
be made to the general BCA bursary fund from eligible applicants). 
Applications for bursaries are expected to be received by the PCG Secretary
<B>at least two weeks</B> prior to any early registration deadline - more
details of deadlines will be publicised on the PCG Website.

<P>
Meeting reports from recipients of PCG bursaries to attend the ECM-19 meeting in 
Nancy (Thomas Lyford, Glyn Owen Jones &amp; Vincent Jennings) have been received and are
 available to view on the PCG Website
