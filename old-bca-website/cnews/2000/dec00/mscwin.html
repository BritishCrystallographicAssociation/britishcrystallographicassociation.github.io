THE WOODLANDS, TX Molecular Structure Corporation proudly announces the
recipients of the first annual MSC Future Investigator Awards. These awards
are designed to reward outstanding and promising researchers early in their
careers before they have become independent investigators. The inaugural MSC
Future Investigators were chosen from numerous applicants based on their
scientific accomplishments in the field of structural biology, their
publications, and the expectation that they will continue to contribute
positively to the field of macromolecular crystallography in the future.
Each of the four will receive an unrestricted $2,500 cash award.</p>
<p> 
The four unranked winners are:
<ul>
  <li>Melanie J. <a href="#ben">Bennett</a>, California Institute of Technology
  <li>Jeffrey C. <a href="#boy">Boyington</a>, LIG/NIAID, National Institutes of Health
  <li>Patrick <a href="#cra">Cramer</a>, Stanford University School of Medicine
  <li>C. Erec <a href="#ste">Stebbins</a>, Yale School of Medicine
</ul>

The work of Dr. Melanie Bennett on the hereditary haemochromatosis protein
HFE and its complex with transferrin receptor (TfR) may help in our
understanding of this iron-overload disorder. Dr. Bennett is a former Fellow
of the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Foundation. </p>

<a name="boy"><p></a>
Dr. Jeffrey Boyington has recently determined the structure of the complex
of the immunoglobulin-like natural killer (NK) cell receptor KIR2DL2 with
its ligand, the class I MHC protein HLA-Cw3. The cytolytic activity of NK
cells is tightly regulated by both activating and inhibitory NK cell
receptors. This particular receptor inhibits NK cell-mediated lysis upon
recognition of certain class I MHC molecules on the surface of healthy host
cells. The KIR/MHC interaction is strikingly different from the interaction
observed between T-cell receptors and MHC molecules and reveals a mechanism
of allotypic specificity. </p>

Dr. Patrick Cramer along with colleagues solved the structure of yeast RNA
Polymerase II, the central enzyme of gene expression that synthesizes all
messenger RNA in eukaryotes.</p>

<a name="ste"><p></a>
Dr. C. Erec Stebbins has worked on many structures during his studies, including the ternary complex of the tumor suppressor VHL bound to Elongin B and Elongin C; the complex of Hsp90 with its inhibitor, geldanamycin, an antitumor antibiotic; and the bacterial GreA transcript cleavage factor, involved in regulating the processivity of RNA polymerase. Dr. Stebbins is a Fellow of the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Foundation. He now studies the structural basis for the modulation of signal transduction pathways by bacterial virulence factors that are translocated into host cells for the benefit of the pathogen.</p>
<p> 
Science textbooks of the future will be updated with the knowledge gleaned
from the fundamental research of our winners. Thus, their accomplishments
will have a lasting impression in the discipline of structural biology. It
is gratifying to award these creative thinkers with the MSC Future
Investigators award to show our appreciation. We wish them great success in
their future research endeavours.</p>
