## The Industrial Group

### Industrial Group Award
It is the intention of the BCA Industrial group to make an Industrial Crystallography Award to suitable UK crystallographers working in industry or in academic institutions. The Award will be given in recognition of a sustained contribution to industrial crystallography including crystallographic and diffraction work of all kinds.

## The Physical Crystallography Group

### PANalytical Thesis Prize for Physical Crystallography

The prize will be awarded for the best use of techniques or methods of Physical Crystallography in a successfully examined thesis submitted in the period from 1st January  to 31st December.

Previous winners

- 2016 Andrew Cairns (ESRF)
- 2015 Joshua Makepeace (University of Oxford)
- 2014 Alexander Hearmon (University of Oxford)

### The Physical Crystallography Prize
The prize is awarded for the best recently published work by a person in the early stages of their career, working in the field of Physical Crystallography, whose research is expected to make a significant impact in the field. The award is traditionally presented at the BCA Spring Meeting and the winner gives a Prize Lecture at that meeting.

Nominations for each prize must be submitted to the Chair of the PCG-SCMP group in mid-February and the Prize will be awarded at the BCA Spring Meeting.
