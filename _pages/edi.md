The BCA Council is pleased to announce the adoption of the following policy:

### CONFERENCE POLICY
The BCA recognizes the positive impact that a conference speaking opportunity has on an individual’s track record and visibility. We also recognize that some sections of the scientific community are often under-represented in conference programmes, and that this can affect diversity in the long-term. Our policies are intended to ensure quality and equality.

### SPEAKER INVITATION POLICY
The program chairs will ensure the highest quality scientific programme, with speakers that represent the broad diversity of our community. We aim to achieve a speaker and programme chair balance that reflects the make-up of our community without bias with regard to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disabilities, age, geography, or national origin.

### REPORTING POLICY
We will report and review statistics on the gender balance of the membership, the composition of committees and of invited speakers, selected speakers, session chairs, and attendees of the BCA Spring Meeting.

### FEEDBACK
We welcome feedback to president@crystallography.org.uk on this policy and how it might be improved for future conferences to better ensure equality and diversity.


This policy was approved by the BCA Council Meeting on 26th March 2018
Version 2: Policy modified to include age in list of criteria in section on SPEAKER INVITATION POLICY following discussion at BCA AGM on 28th March 2018
