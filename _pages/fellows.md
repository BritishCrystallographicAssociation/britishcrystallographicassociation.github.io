The 2023 BCA AGM approved the creation of a new Fellow category of BCA membership. The definition of this new category is now defined in the statutes as follows:

Fellows shall be those persons with an established career in crystallographic teaching or research who hold one other class of membership and who pay an annual subscription. Fellows will normally have been members of the Association for at least five years, but the Officers of the Association shall consider applications to waive this requirement. The subscription level for Fellows shall be determined by the Council and confirmed by the Annual General Meeting of the Association.

Application for the Fellow category of membership is now available. In addition to recognizing an established career, the new membership category provides a simple way to support the organization through the membership subscription.

As noted in the text from the Statutes above, Fellows will normally have been members of the Association for at least five years, but Officers can waive this requirement. Waivers are intended for exceptional cases, for example: new BCA members who already have an established a career outside the UK; or BCA members who have taken recent career breaks.

The current rates for Fellow membership of the BCA were set by the AGM at double the rates for the members normal renewal price. It has not escaped our attention that this represents an exceptionally good deal for Honorary members - however, please note that we might change this 
formula in the future.

If you pay by Direct Debit and want to apply for the fellowship status you will need to log in to your BCA membership and apply through your membership page.
