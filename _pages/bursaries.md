Bursaries sponsored by the ABBF are available for BCA members to attend BCA Spring meetings and other crystallographic meetings. The ABBF was set up in 2001 by the BCA council in honour of Dr Arnold Beevers. Arnold was a firm believer in the free and open exchange of scientific ideas and information. He was also a founder member of the BCA and thrived on getting together with people of all ages at BCA, IUCr and ECM meetings. For more info see the [June 2001 issue of Crystallography news]({{ "/assets/pdf/crystallography-news/2001-06.pdf#page=4" | relative_url }}).

The ABBF is supported by proceeds from the BCA and several generous donations, which it gratefully acknowledges. Further contributions to this worthwhile cause are always welcome.

## Other Bursaries â€“ External Sponsor Bursaries

The ABBF is limited, and often the BCA find that they cannot support all applicants attending the BCA Spring Meeting. We are fortunate that external sponsors have been willing to sponsor those not receiving ABBF assistance. Applications for these should be made in the same way as for ABBF.

## PCG Bursaries 

The Physical Crystallography Group of the BCA welcomes bursary applications from BCA or IoP members who are affiliated to the PCG or to the Structural Condensed Matter Physics Group of the IoP. These are intended mainly to help young scientists (students and post-docs) to attend meetings and conferences relevant to PCG/SCMP areas of interest. Bursaries can be applied for through out the year with deadlines on 1st of March, June, September and December, through the IOP, and will be considered by the Group Committee. However, each year we expect to target selected meetings as highly relevant for the award of bursaries.
