The British Crystallographic Association, formed in 1982 is the 
UK national association for this important science.

Crystallography is a vital part of much modern research into 
the structure and properties of materials ranging across the scientific 
fields of Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Materials science and Engineering.

With over 600 members representing the huge academic and industrial 
effort in crystallography in this country, the BCA has as its prime 
aims the promotion of crystallography in research and the education 
of young people and others in the methods, possibilities and achievements 
of crystallographic science.

The four subject based groups within the association: biological 
structures; chemical crystallography; industrial applications & 
physical crystallography – represent the more specialist research 
areas, and the interdisciplinary young crystallographers group 
encourages a strong interaction and exchange of ideas among 
post-graduate students and members by organising regular meetings. 
Many meetings, workshops and schools are organised by the BCA 
groups, contributing to the dissemination of crystallographic 
knowledge and education.

The BCA can award Honorary Life Membership to crystallographers who 
have made significant contributions to the field and to the BCA.

Many of the crystallographic pioneers worked in the UK including the 
Braggs – father and son – Wilkins, Perutz, Hodgkin, Kendrew & Klug. 
Currently, there is huge UK crystallographic activity contributing 
to research in virology, structural gemomics, cancer research, 
enzymology, pharmaceutucals, superconductors, semiconductors, 
magnetic materials, laser materials, polymers, battery and fuel 
cell materials, zeolites, materials under stress and many other areas.
