The BCA is committed to running events which provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof, and technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. 
Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any platform during an event, including talks, workshops, parties, and social media. Participants violating these rules may 
be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal, written or online comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, ethnicity, religion, and technology choices. Additionally, harassment includes display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Event participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, or you notice someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organiser. Event staff can help participants 
contact local security or the police, provide escorts, and otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

All event participants including organisers, exhibitors, and speakers are expected to comply with this code of conduct at BCA events, including online or in-person meetings, 
workshops and conferences, and related social events.
