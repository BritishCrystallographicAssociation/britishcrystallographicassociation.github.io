Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting will begin with the optional, but increasingly popular Young Crystallographers’ meeting on the afternoon of Monday 15th April and morning of Tuesday 16th March. The main meeting begins immediately afterwards on Tuesday 16th and closes at lunch time on Thursday 18th April. An exciting and varied programme is currently being assembled by our programme committee, chaired by Emma McCabe, and promises relevant and interesting talks in every session. This meeting is a great opportunity to catch up with the latest crystallographic science, and of course with your fellow crystallographers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting will include the BCA Prize Lecture and the Lonsdale Lecture as well as plenary speakers from each group of the Association. The traditional early-career prize session will be held on the afternoon of Wednesday 17th March. Throughout the rest of the program there will often be three sessions running in parallel in addition to a range of workshops. Please visit the meeting website for up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We very much look forward to seeing you in Nottingham in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the meeting will be posted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcaspringmeetings.org.uk/home&quot;&gt;BCA Spring Meeting website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The organizing committee look forward to welcoming you to the Spring Meeting 2019 at the Jubilee Campus of University of Nottingham from 15th – 18th April 2019.</summary></entry></feed>
