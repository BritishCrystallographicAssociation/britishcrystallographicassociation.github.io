<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Formal proposals to amend the Statutes may be made by the Council or by five members of the Association. Such proposals shall be circulated to the Members at least one month in advance of the Annual General Meeting at which they are to be discussed, and shall specify the time at which the amendments, if adopted, shall take effect. Any amendment to the Statutes requires a quorum of thirty and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of those present and entitled to vote.
No amendment shall be made to Statute A.2, or to Statutes H.1 and 3 without the prior approval of the Charity Commissioners, and no amendment shall be made which would cause the Association to cease to be a charity at law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

Such a proposal shall be circulated to Members at least six months in advance of the General Meeting at which it is to be discussed, and shall specify the time at which the proposal, if approved, will take effect. Dissolution of the Association requires a quorum of one hundred, or half the membership, whichever is the less, and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of those present and entitled to vote. If this quorum is not obtained, the meeting may resolve, by voting in accordance with Statute F.3, to consider a resolution for dissolution at a second General Meeting held not less than six months after the first. Notice of this meeting shall be circulated to Members within one month, and each shall be provided with a ballot paper on which he may record his vote on the resolution for dissolution. Such ballots, if signed by the member and delivered to the Secretary at least 24 hours before the second General Meeting, shall have the same force as votes cast at the meeting, provided that each member shall have only one vote. The names of members voting by absentee ballot shall be recorded and announced at the meeting. Voting at this meeting shall otherwise be in accordance with Statute F.3.</p>
